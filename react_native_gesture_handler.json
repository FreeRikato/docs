It's designed to be a replacement of React Native's built in touch system called Gesture Responder System. Using native touch handling allows to address the performance limitations of React Native's Gesture Responder System. It also provides more control over the platform's native components that can handle gestures on their own. If you want to learn more, we recommend this talk by Krzysztof Magiera in which he explains issues with the responder system.\n\nThe main benefits of using React Native Gesture Handler are:\n\nA way to use a platform's native touch handling system for recognizing gestures (like pinch, rotation, pan and a few others).\nThe ability to define relations between gestures to ensure gestures, and possibly native components, will not conflict with each other.\nMechanisms to use touchable components that run in native thread and follow platform default behavior; e.g. in the event they are in a scrollable component, turning into pressed state is slightly delayed to prevent it from highlighting when you fling.\nClose integration with react-native-reanimated to process touch events on the UI thread.\nSupport for different input devices like touch screens, pens and mice.\nAbility to include any native component into the Gesture Handler's touch system, making it work alongside your gestures.\nINFO\n\nWe recommended to use Reanimated to implement gesture-driven animations with Gesture Handler. Its more advanced features rely heavily on worklets and the UI runtime provided by Reanimated.\n\nLearning resources�\nApps�\n\nGesture Handler Example App – official gesture handler \"showcase\" app.\n\nTalks and workshops�\n\nDeclarative future of gestures and animations in React Native by Krzysztof Magiera - talk that explains motivation behind creating gesture handler library. It also presents react-native-reanimated and how and when it can be used with gesture handler.\n\nReact Native workshop with Expo team @ReactEurope 2018 by Brent Vatne – great workshop explaining gesture handler in details and presenting a few exercises that will help get you started.\n\nLiving in an async world of React Native by Krzysztof Magiera – talk which highlights some issue with the React Native's touch system Gesture Handler aims to address. Also the motivation for building this library is explained.\n\nReact Native Touch & Gesture by Krzysztof Magiera - talk explaining JS responder system limitations and points out some of the core features of Gesture Handler.\n\nContributing�\n\nIf you are interested in the project and want to contribute or support it in other ways don't hesitate to contact anyone from the team on Twitter or Bluesky (links below)!\n\nAll PRs are welcome, but talk to us before you start working on something big.\n\nThe easiest way to get started with contributing code is by:\n\nReviewing the list of open issues and trying to solve the one that seem approachable to you.\nUpdating the documentation whenever you see some information is unclear, missing or out of date.\n\nCode is only one way how you can contribute.

At any given time, each handler instance has an assigned state that can change when new touch events occur or can be forced to change by the touch system in certain circumstances.\n\nA gesture can be in one of the six possible states:\n\nUNDETERMINED�\n\nThis is the initial state of each gesture recognizer and it goes into this state after it's done recognizing a gesture.\n\nFAILED�\n\nA gesture recognizer received some touches but for some reason didn't recognize them. For example, if a finger travels more distance than a defined maxDist property allows, then the gesture won't become active but will fail instead. Afterwards, it's state will be reset to UNDETERMINED.\n\nBEGAN�\n\nGesture recognizer has started receiving touch stream but hasn't yet received enough data to either fail or activate.\n\nCANCELLED�\n\nThe gesture recognizer has received a signal (possibly new touches or a command from the touch system controller) resulting in the cancellation of a continuous gesture. The gesture's state will become CANCELLED until it is finally reset to the initial state, UNDETERMINED.\n\nACTIVE�\n\nRecognizer has recognized a gesture. It will become and stay in the ACTIVE state until the gesture finishes (e.g. when user lifts the finger) or gets cancelled by the touch system. Under normal circumstances the state will then turn into END. In the case that a gesture is cancelled by the touch system, its state would then become CANCELLED.\n\nEND�\n\nThe gesture recognizer has received touches signalling the end of a gesture. Its state will become END until it is reset to UNDETERMINED.\n\nState flows�\n\nThe most typical flow of state is when a gesture picks up on an initial touch event, then recognizes it, then acknowledges its ending and resets itself back to the initial state.\n\nThe flow looks as follows:\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nGesture.Pan()\nGesture.LongPress()\nUNDETERMINED\nUNDETERMINED\nBEGAN\nFAILED\nBEGAN\nFAILED\nACTIVE\nCANCELLED\nACTIVE\nCANCELLED\nEND\nEND\nDrag or long-press the circle\nEvents�\n\nThere are three types of events in RNGH2: StateChangeEvent, GestureEvent and PointerEvent. The StateChangeEvent is send every time a gesture moves to a different state, while GestureEvent is send every time a gesture is updated. The first two carry a gesture-specific data and a state property, indicating the current state of the gesture. StateChangeEvent also carries a oldState property indicating the previous state of the gesture. PointerEvent carries information about raw touch events, like touching the screen or moving the finger. These events are handled internally before they are passed along to the correct callbacks:\n\nonBegin�\n\nIs called when a gesture transitions to the BEGAN state.\n\nonStart�\n\nIs called when a gesture transitions to the ACTIVE state.\n\nonEnd�\n\nIs called when a gesture transitions from the ACTIVE state to the END, FAILED, or CANCELLED state. If the gesture transitions to the END state, the success argument is set to true otherwise it is set to false.\n\nonFinalize�\n\nIs called when a gesture transitions to the END, FAILED, or CANCELLED state. If the gesture transitions to the END state, the success argument is set to true otherwise it is set to false. If the gesture transitions from the ACTIVE state, it will be called after onEnd.\n\nonUpdate�\n\nIs called every time a gesture is updated while it is in the ACTIVE state.\n\nonPointerDown�\n\nIs called when new pointers are placed on the screen. It may carry information about more than one pointer because the events are batched.\n\nonPointerMove�\n\nIs called when pointers are moved on the screen. It may carry information about more than one pointer because the events are batched.\n\nonPointerUp�\n\nIs called when pointers are lifted from the screen. It may carry information about more than one pointer because the events are batched.\n\nonPointerCancelled�\n\nIs called when there will be no more information about this pointer. It may be called because the gesture has ended or was interrupted. It may carry information about more than one pointer because the events are batched.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nGesture composition & interactions\nNEXT\nGuides\nState flows\nEvents\nonBegin\nonStart\nonEnd\nonFinalize\nonUpdate\nonPointerDown\nonPointerMove\nonPointerUp\nonPointerCancelled\n\nReduce context switching & preview components instantly.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Start with installing the package from npm:�\nEXPO\nNPM\nYARN\nnpx expo install react-native-gesture-handler\n\n2. Wrap your app with GestureHandlerRootView component�\nimport { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <GestureHandlerRootView>\n      <ActualApp />\n    </GestureHandlerRootView>\n  );\n}\n\n\nIf you don't provide anything to the styles prop, it will default to flex: 1. If you want to customize the styling of the root view, don't forget to also include flex: 1 in the custom style, otherwise your app won't render anything. Keep GestureHandlerRootView as close to the actual root of the app as possible. It's the entry point for all gestures and all gesture relations. The gestures won't be recognized outside of the root view, and relations only work between gestures mounted under the same root view.\n\nIf you're unsure if one of your dependencies already renders GestureHandlerRootView on its own, don't worry and add one at the root anyway. In case of nested root views, Gesture Handler will only use the top-most one and ignore the nested ones.\n\nTIP\n\nIf you're using gesture handler in your component library, you may want to wrap your library's code in the GestureHandlerRootView component. This will avoid extra configuration for the user.\n\nTIP\n\nIf you're having trouble with gestures not working when inside a component provided by a third-party library, even though you've wrapped the entry point with <GestureHandlerRootView>, you can try adding another <GestureHandlerRootView unstable_forceActive> closer to the place the gestures are defined. This way, you can prevent Android from canceling relevant gestures when one of the native views tries to grab lock for delivering touch events.\n\n3. Platform specific setup�\nExpo development build�\n\nWhen using an Expo development build, run prebuild to update the native code in the ios and android directories.\n\nnpx expo prebuild\n\nAndroid�\n\nSetting up Gesture Handler on Android doesn't require any more steps. Keep in mind that if you want to use gestures in Modals you need to wrap Modal's content with GestureHandlerRootView:\n\nimport { Modal } from 'react-native';\nimport { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nexport function CustomModal({ children, ...rest }) {\n  return (\n    <Modal {...rest}>\n      <GestureHandlerRootView>{children}</GestureHandlerRootView>\n    </Modal>\n  );\n}\n\nKotlin�\n\nGesture Handler on Android is implemented in Kotlin. If you need to set a specific Kotlin version to be used by the library, set the kotlinVersion ext property in android/build.gradle file and RNGH will use that version:\n\nbuildscript {\n    ext {\n        kotlinVersion = \"1.6.21\"\n    }\n}\n\niOS�\n\nWhile developing for iOS, make sure to install pods first before running the app:\n\ncd ios && pod install && cd ..\n\nWeb�\n\nThere is no additional configuration required for the web, however, since the Gesture Handler 2.10.0 the new web implementation is enabled by default. We recommend you to check if the gestures in your app are working as expected since their behavior should now resemble the native platforms. If you don't want to use the new implementation, you can still revert back to the legacy one by enabling it at the beginning of your index.js file:\n\nimport { enableLegacyWebImplementation } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nenableLegacyWebImplementation(true);\n\n\nNonetheless, it's recommended to adapt to the new implementation, as the legacy one will be dropped in the next major release of Gesture Handler.\n\nWith wix/react-native-navigation�\n\nIf you are using a native navigation library like wix/react-native-navigation you need to make sure that every screen is wrapped with GestureHandlerRootView. This can be done for example at the stage when you register your screens. Here's an example:\n\nimport { Navigation } from 'react-native-navigation';\nimport FirstTabScreen from './FirstTabScreen';\nimport SecondTabScreen from './SecondTabScreen';\nimport PushedScreen from './PushedScreen';\n// register all screens of the app (including internal ones)\nexport function registerScreens() {\n  Navigation.registerComponent(\n    'example.FirstTabScreen',\n    () => {\n      return (\n        <GestureHandlerRootView>\n          <FirstTabScreen />\n        </GestureHandlerRootView>\n      );\n    },\n    () => FirstTabScreen\n  );\n  Navigation.registerComponent(\n    'example.SecondTabScreen',\n    () => {\n      return (\n        <GestureHandlerRootView>\n          <SecondTabScreen />\n        </GestureHandlerRootView>\n      );\n    },\n    () => SecondTabScreen\n  );\n  Navigation.registerComponent(\n    'example.PushedScreen',\n    () => {\n      return (\n        <GestureHandlerRootView>\n          <PushedScreen />\n        </GestureHandlerRootView>\n      );\n    },\n    () => PushedScreen\n  );\n}\n\n\nYou can check out this example project to see this kind of set up in action.\n\nRemember that you need to wrap each screen that you use in your app with GestureHandlerRootView as with native navigation libraries each screen maps to a separate root view. It will not be enough to wrap the main screen only.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nIntroduction\nNEXT\nGesture composition & interactions\nRequirements\n1.

Instead you can use Race, Simultaneous and Exclusive methods provided by the Gesture object.\n\nRace�\n\nOnly one of the provided gestures can become active at the same time. The first gesture to become active will cancel the rest of the gestures. It accepts variable number of arguments. It is the equivalent to having more than one gesture handler without defining simultaneousHandlers and waitFor props.\n\nFor example, lets say that you have a component that you want to make draggable but you also want to show additional options on long press. Presumably you would not want the component to move after the long press activates. You can accomplish this using Race:\n\nNote: the useSharedValue and useAnimatedStyle are part of react-native-reanimated.\n\nimport { GestureDetector, Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nimport Animated, {\n  useSharedValue,\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n  withTiming,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const offset = useSharedValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n  const start = useSharedValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n  const popupPosition = useSharedValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n  const popupAlpha = useSharedValue(0);\n\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    return {\n      transform: [\n        { translateX: offset.value.x },\n        { translateY: offset.value.y },\n      ],\n    };\n  });\n\n  const animatedPopupStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    return {\n      transform: [\n        { translateX: popupPosition.value.x },\n        { translateY: popupPosition.value.y },\n      ],\n      opacity: popupAlpha.value,\n    };\n  });\n\n  const dragGesture = Gesture.Pan()\n    .onStart((_e) => {\n      popupAlpha.value = withTiming(0);\n    })\n    .onUpdate((e) => {\n      offset.value = {\n        x: e.translationX + start.value.x,\n        y: e.translationY + start.value.y,\n      };\n    })\n    .onEnd(() => {\n      start.value = {\n        x: offset.value.x,\n        y: offset.value.y,\n      };\n    });\n\n  const longPressGesture = Gesture.LongPress().onStart((_event) => {\n    popupPosition.value = { x: offset.value.x, y: offset.value.y };\n    popupAlpha.value = withTiming(1);\n  });\n\n  const composed = Gesture.Race(dragGesture, longPressGesture);\n\n  return (\n    <Animated.View>\n      <Popup style={animatedPopupStyles} />\n      <GestureDetector gesture={composed}>\n        <Component style={animatedStyles} />\n      </GestureDetector>\n    </Animated.View>\n  );\n}\n\nSimultaneous�\n\nAll of the provided gestures can activate at the same time. Activation of one will not cancel the other. It is the equivalent to having some gesture handlers, each with simultaneousHandlers prop set to the other handlers.\n\nFor example, if you want to make a gallery app, you might want user to be able to zoom, rotate and pan around photos. You can do it with Simultaneous:\n\nNote: the useSharedValue and useAnimatedStyle are part of react-native-reanimated.\n\nimport { GestureDetector, Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nimport Animated, {\n  useSharedValue,\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const offset = useSharedValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n  const start = useSharedValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n  const scale = useSharedValue(1);\n  const savedScale = useSharedValue(1);\n  const rotation = useSharedValue(0);\n  const savedRotation = useSharedValue(0);\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    return {\n      transform: [\n        { translateX: offset.value.x },\n        { translateY: offset.value.y },\n        { scale: scale.value },\n        { rotateZ: `${rotation.value}rad` },\n      ],\n    };\n  });\n\n  const dragGesture = Gesture.Pan()\n    .averageTouches(true)\n    .onUpdate((e) => {\n      offset.value = {\n        x: e.translationX + start.value.x,\n        y: e.translationY + start.value.y,\n      };\n    })\n    .onEnd(() => {\n      start.value = {\n        x: offset.value.x,\n        y: offset.value.y,\n      };\n    });\n\n  const zoomGesture = Gesture.Pinch()\n    .onUpdate((event) => {\n      scale.value = savedScale.value * event.scale;\n    })\n    .onEnd(() => {\n      savedScale.value = scale.value;\n    });\n\n  const rotateGesture = Gesture.Rotation()\n    .onUpdate((event) => {\n      rotation.value = savedRotation.value + event.rotation;\n    })\n    .onEnd(() => {\n      savedRotation.value = rotation.value;\n    });\n\n  const composed = Gesture.Simultaneous(\n    dragGesture,\n    Gesture.Simultaneous(zoomGesture, rotateGesture)\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <Animated.View>\n      <GestureDetector gesture={composed}>\n        <Photo style={animatedStyles} />\n      </GestureDetector>\n    </Animated.View>\n  );\n}\n\nExclusive�\n\nOnly one of the provided gestures can become active, with the first one having a higher priority than the second one (if both gestures are still possible, the second one will wait for the first one to fail before it activates), second one having a higher priority than the third one, and so on. It is equivalent to having some gesture handlers where the second one has the waitFor prop set to the first handler, third one has the waitFor prop set to the first and the second one, and so on.\n\nFor example, if you want to make a component that responds to single tap as well as to a double tap, you can accomplish that using Exclusive:\n\nNote: the useSharedValue and useAnimatedStyle are part of react-native-reanimated.\n\nimport { GestureDetector, Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const singleTap = Gesture.Tap().onEnd((_event, success) => {\n    if (success) {\n      console.log('single tap!');\n    }\n  });\n  const doubleTap = Gesture.Tap()\n    .numberOfTaps(2)\n    .onEnd((_event, success) => {\n      if (success) {\n        console.log('double tap!');\n      }\n    });\n\n  const taps = Gesture.Exclusive(doubleTap, singleTap);\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={taps}>\n      <Component />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nCross-component interactions\n\nYou may have noticed that gesture composition described above requires you to mount all of the composed gestures under a single GestureDetector, effectively attaching them to the same underlying component. You can customize how gestures interact with each other across multiple components in a couple of ways:\n\nrequireExternalGestureToFail�\n\nrequireExternalGestureToFail allows to delay activation of the handler until all handlers passed as arguments to this method fail (or don't begin at all).\n\nFor example, you may want to have two nested components, both of them can be tapped by the user to trigger different actions: outer view requires one tap, but the inner one requires 2 taps. If you don't want the first tap on the inner view to activate the outer handler, you must make the outer gesture wait until the inner one fails:\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport {\n  GestureDetector,\n  Gesture,\n  GestureHandlerRootView,\n} from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nexport default function Example() {\n  const innerTap = Gesture.Tap()\n    .numberOfTaps(2)\n    .onStart(() => {\n      console.log('inner tap');\n    });\n\n  const outerTap = Gesture.Tap()\n    .onStart(() => {\n      console.log('outer tap');\n    })\n    .requireExternalGestureToFail(innerTap);\n\n  return (\n    <GestureHandlerRootView style={styles.container}>\n      <GestureDetector gesture={outerTap}>\n        <View style={styles.outer}>\n          <GestureDetector gesture={innerTap}>\n            <View style={styles.inner} />\n          </GestureDetector>\n        </View>\n      </GestureDetector>\n    </GestureHandlerRootView>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n  },\n  outer: {\n    width: 250,\n    height: 250,\n    backgroundColor: 'lightblue',\n  },\n  inner: {\n    width: 100,\n    height: 100,\n    backgroundColor: 'blue',\n    alignSelf: 'center',\n  },\n});\n\nblocksExternalGesture�\n\nblocksExternalGesture works similarly to requireExternalGestureToFail but the direction of the relation is reversed - instead of being one-to-many relation, it's many-to-one. It's especially useful for making lists where the ScrollView component needs to wait for every gesture underneath it. All that's required to do is to pass a ref, for example:\n\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport {\n  GestureDetector,\n  Gesture,\n  GestureHandlerRootView,\n  ScrollView,\n} from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nimport Animated, {\n  useSharedValue,\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n  withTiming,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nconst ITEMS = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'];\n\nfunction Item({ backgroundColor, scrollRef }) {\n  const scale = useSharedValue(1);\n  const zIndex = useSharedValue(1);\n\n  const pinch = Gesture.Pinch()\n    .blocksExternalGesture(scrollRef)\n    .onBegin(() => {\n      zIndex.value = 100;\n    })\n    .onChange((e) => {\n      scale.value *= e.scaleChange;\n    })\n    .onFinalize(() => {\n      scale.value = withTiming(1, undefined, (finished) => {\n        if (finished) {\n          zIndex.value = 1;\n        }\n      });\n    });\n\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    transform: [{ scale: scale.value }],\n    zIndex: zIndex.value,\n  }));\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={pinch}>\n      <Animated.View\n        style={[\n          { backgroundColor: backgroundColor },\n          styles.item,\n          animatedStyles,\n        ]}\n      />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Example() {\n  const scrollRef = useRef();\n\n  return (\n    <GestureHandlerRootView style={styles.container}>\n      <ScrollView style={styles.container} ref={scrollRef}>\n        {ITEMS.map((item) => (\n          <Item backgroundColor={item} key={item} scrollRef={scrollRef} />\n        ))}\n      </ScrollView>\n    </GestureHandlerRootView>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n  },\n  item: {\n    flex: 1,\n    aspectRatio: 1,\n  },\n});\n\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture�\n\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture allows gestures across different components to be recognized simultaneously. For example, you may want to have two nested views, both with tap gesture attached. Both of them require one tap, but tapping the inner one should also activate the gesture attached to the outer view:\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport {\n  GestureDetector,\n  Gesture,\n  GestureHandlerRootView,\n} from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nexport default function Example() {\n  const innerTap = Gesture.Tap()\n    .onStart(() => {\n      console.log('inner tap');\n    });\n\n  const outerTap = Gesture.Tap()\n    .onStart(() => {\n      console.log('outer tap');\n    })\n    .simultaneousWithExternalGesture(innerTap);\n\n  return (\n    <GestureHandlerRootView style={styles.container}>\n      <GestureDetector gesture={outerTap}>\n        <View style={styles.outer}>\n          <GestureDetector gesture={innerTap}>\n            <View style={styles.inner} />\n          </GestureDetector>\n        </View>\n      </GestureDetector>\n    </GestureHandlerRootView>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n  },\n  outer: {\n    width: 250,\n    height: 250,\n    backgroundColor: 'lightblue',\n  },\n  inner: {\n    width: 100,\n    height: 100,\n    backgroundColor: 'blue',\n    alignSelf: 'center',\n  },\n});\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nInstallation\nNEXT\nGesture states & events\nRace\nSimultaneous\nExclusive\nrequireExternalGestureToFail\nblocksExternalGesture\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture\n\nAn all-in-one IDE for Expo & React Native.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

That's all!\n\nTo demonstrate how you would use the new API, let's make a simple app where you can drag a ball around. You will need to add react-native-gesture-handler (for gestures) and react-native-reanimated (for animations) modules.\n\nStep 1\nFirst let's define styles we will need to make the app:\nimport { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  ball: {\n    width: 100,\n    height: 100,\n    borderRadius: 100,\n    backgroundColor: 'blue',\n    alignSelf: 'center',\n  },\n});\n\nStep 2\nThen we can start writing our Ball component:\nimport { GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction Ball() {\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector>\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.ball]} />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nStep 3\n\nWe also need to define\n\nshared values\n\nto keep track of the ball position and create animated styles in order to be able to position the ball on the screen:\n\nimport {\n  useSharedValue,\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n  withSpring,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction Ball() {\n  const isPressed = useSharedValue(false);\n  const offset = useSharedValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    return {\n      transform: [\n        { translateX: offset.value.x },\n        { translateY: offset.value.y },\n        { scale: withSpring(isPressed.value ? 1.2 : 1) },\n      ],\n      backgroundColor: isPressed.value ? 'yellow' : 'blue',\n    };\n  });\n\n  // ...\n}\n\nStep 4\nAnd add it to the ball's styles:\n// ...\nreturn (\n  <GestureDetector>\n\n    <Animated.View style={[styles.ball, animatedStyles]} />\n\n  </GestureDetector>\n);\n// ...\n\nStep 5\n\nThe only thing left is to define the pan gesture and assign it to the detector:\n\nimport { Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nfunction Ball() {\n  // ...\n  const start = useSharedValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n  const gesture = Gesture.Pan()\n    .onBegin(() => {\n      isPressed.value = true;\n    })\n    .onUpdate((e) => {\n      offset.value = {\n        x: e.translationX + start.value.x,\n        y: e.translationY + start.value.y,\n      };\n    })\n    .onEnd(() => {\n      start.value = {\n        x: offset.value.x,\n        y: offset.value.y,\n      };\n    })\n    .onFinalize(() => {\n      isPressed.value = false;\n    });\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ...\nreturn (\n\n  <GestureDetector gesture={gesture}>\n\n    <Animated.View style={[styles.ball, animatedStyles]} />\n  </GestureDetector>\n);\n// ...\n\n\nNote the start shared value. We need it to store the position of the ball at the moment we grab it to be able to correctly position it later, because we only have access to translation relative to the starting point of the gesture.\n\nNow you can just add Ball component to some view in the app and see the results! (Or you can just check the code here and see it in action in the Example app.)\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nGuides\nNEXT\nManual gestures\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

To demonstrate how to make a manual gesture we will make a simple one that tracks all pointers on the screen.\n\nStep 1\n\nFirst, we need a way to store information about the pointer: whether it should be visible and its position.\n\ninterface Pointer {\n  visible: boolean;\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n}\n\nStep 2\n\nWe also need a component to mark where a pointer is. In order to accomplish that we will make a component that accepts two shared values: one holding information about the pointer using the interface we just created, the other holding a bool indicating whether the gesture has activated. In this example when the gesture is not active, the ball representing it will be blue and when it is active the ball will be red and slightly bigger.\n\nimport { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport Animated, {\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n  useSharedValue,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction PointerElement(props: {\n  pointer: Animated.SharedValue<Pointer>,\n  active: Animated.SharedValue<boolean>,\n}) {\n  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    transform: [\n      { translateX: props.pointer.value.x },\n      { translateY: props.pointer.value.y },\n      {\n        scale:\n          (props.pointer.value.visible ? 1 : 0) *\n          (props.active.value ? 1.3 : 1),\n      },\n    ],\n    backgroundColor: props.active.value ? 'red' : 'blue',\n  }));\n\n  return <Animated.View style={[styles.pointer, animatedStyle]} />;\n}\n\n// ...\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  pointer: {\n    width: 60,\n    height: 60,\n    borderRadius: 30,\n    backgroundColor: 'red',\n    position: 'absolute',\n    marginStart: -30,\n    marginTop: -30,\n  },\n});\n\nStep 3\n\nNow we have to make a component that will handle the gesture and draw all the pointer indicators. We will store data about pointers in an array of size 12 as that is the maximum number of touches that RNGH will track, and render them inside an Animated.View.\n\nimport { Gesture, GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nexport default function Example() {\n  const trackedPointers: Animated.SharedValue<Pointer>[] = [];\n  const active = useSharedValue(false);\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < 12; i++) {\n    trackedPointers[i] =\n      useSharedValue <\n      Pointer >\n      {\n        visible: false,\n        x: 0,\n        y: 0,\n      };\n  }\n\n  const gesture = Gesture.Manual();\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={gesture}>\n      <Animated.View style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n        {trackedPointers.map((pointer, index) => (\n          <PointerElement pointer={pointer} active={active} key={index} />\n        ))}\n      </Animated.View>\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nStep 4\n\nWe have our components set up and we can finally get to making the gesture! We will start with onTouchesDown where we need to set position of the pointers and make them visible. We can get this information from the touches property of the event. In this case we will also check how many pointers are on the screen and activate the gesture if there are at least two.\n\nconst gesture = Gesture.Manual().onTouchesDown((e, manager) => {\n\n  for (const touch of e.changedTouches) {\n\n    trackedPointers[touch.id].value = {\n\n      visible: true,\n\n      x: touch.x,\n\n      y: touch.y,\n\n    };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  if (e.numberOfTouches >= 2) {\n\n    manager.activate();\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nStep 5\n\nNext, we will handle pointer movement. In onTouchesMove we will simply update the position of moved pointers.\n\nconst gesture = Gesture.Manual()\n    ...\n\n    .onTouchesMove((e, _manager) => {\n\n      for (const touch of e.changedTouches) {\n\n        trackedPointers[touch.id].value = {\n\n          visible: true,\n\n          x: touch.x,\n\n          y: touch.y,\n\n        };\n\n      }\n\n    })\n\nStep 6\n\nWe also need to handle lifting fingers from the screen, which corresponds to onTouchesUp. Here we will just hide the pointers that were lifted and end the gesture if there are no more pointers on the screen. Note that we are not handling onTouchesCancelled as in this very basic case we don't expect it to happen, however you should clear data about cancelled pointers (most of the time all active ones) when it is called.\n\nconst gesture = Gesture.Manual()\n    ...\n\n    .onTouchesUp((e, manager) => {\n\n      for (const touch of e.changedTouches) {\n\n        trackedPointers[touch.id].value = {\n\n          visible: false,\n\n          x: touch.x,\n\n          y: touch.y,\n\n        };\n\n      }\n\n\n\n      if (e.numberOfTouches === 0) {\n\n        manager.end();\n\n      }\n\n    })\n\nStep 7\n\nNow that our pointers are being tracked correctly and we have the state management, we can handle activation and ending of the gesture. In our case, we will simply set the active shared value either to true or false.\n\nconst gesture = Gesture.Manual()\n  ...\n\n  .onStart(() => {\n\n    active.value = true;\n\n  })\n\n  .onEnd(() => {\n\n    active.value = false;\n\n  });\n\n\nAnd that's all! As you can see using manual gestures is really easy but as you can imagine, manual gestures are a powerful tool that makes it possible to accomplish things that were previously impossible with RNGH.\n\nModifying existing gestures�\n\nWhile manual gestures open great possibilities we are aware that reimplementing pinch or rotation from scratch just because you need to activate in specific circumstances or require position of the fingers, would be a waste of time as those gestures are already available. Therefore, you can use touch events with every gesture to extract more detailed information about the gesture than what the basic events alone provide. We also added a manualActivation modifier on all continuous gestures, which prevents the gesture it is applied to from activating automatically, giving you full control over its behavior.\n\nThis functionality makes another highly requested feature possible: drag after long press. Simply set manualActivation to true on a PanGesture and use StateManager to fail the gesture if the user attempts to drag the component sooner than the duration of the long press.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nQuick start\nNEXT\nTroubleshooting\nModifying existing gestures\n\nRun, preview, and debug your React Native & Expo apps without leaving VSCode.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

We are sorry that you might have encountered issues though. Here is how you can seek help:\n\nSearch over the issues on Github. There is a chance someone had this problem in the past and it has been resolved!\nWhen sure your problem hasn't been reported or was reported but the proposed solution doesn't work for you please follow our issue reporting guidelines.\nYou can try seeking help on Expo Developers Discord where we often hang out.\nIf you feel like reading the source code I highly recommend it, as this is by far the best resource and gives you the most up to date insights into how the library works and what might be causing the bug.\nIf you managed to find the solution consider contributing a fix or update our documentation to make this information easier to find for the others in the future.\nReporting issues�\n\nThis library is maintained by a very small team. Please be mindful of that when reporting issue and when it happens that we can't get back to you as soon as you might expect. We would love to fix all the problems as soon as possible, but often our time is constraint with other issues/features or projects. To make it easier for us to understand your issue and to be able to approach it sooner you can help by:\n\nMaking sure the issue description is complete. Please include all the details about your environment (library version, RN version, device OS etc).\nIt is the best to provide an example app that reproduces the issue you are having. Put it up on gist, snack or create a repo on Github – it doesn't matter as long as we can easily pull it in, run and see the issue.\nExplain how you run your repro app and what steps to take to reproduce the issue.\nIsolate your issue from other dependencies you might be using and make the repro app as minimal as possible.\nIf you have spent some time figuring out the root cause of the problem you can leave a note about your findings so far.\nDo not comment on closed issues. It is very unlikely that we are going to notice your comment in such a case. If the issue has been closed, but the proposed solution doesn't work for you, please open a new one providing all the information necessary and linking to the solution you have tried.\nIt's not a bug, it's a feature�\nChanging enabled prop during a gesture has no effect, only when a gesture starts (that is a finger touches the screen) the enabled prop is taken into consideration to decide whether to extract (or not) the gesture and provide it with stream of events to analyze.\nNative gesture may not conform to the standard state flow due to platform specific workarounds to incorporate native views into RNGH.\nKeep in mind that Touchables from RNGH are rendering two additional views that may need to be styled separately to achieve desired effect (style and containerStyle props).\nIn order for the gesture composition to work, all composed gestures must be attached to the same GestureHandlerRootView.\nMultiple instances of Gesture Handler were detected�\n\nThis error usually happens when in your project there exists more than one instance of Gesture Handler. It can occur when some of your dependencies have installed Gesture Handler inside their own node_modules instead of using it as a peer dependency. In this case two different versions of Gesture Handler JS module try to install the same Native Module. You can resolve this problem manually by modifying your package.json file.\n\nYou can check which libraries are using Gesture Handler, for example, with the command:\n\nnpm ls react-native-gesture-handler\nyarn why react-native-gesture-handler\n\n\nIf you use yarn you should add resolution property.\n\n\"resolutions\": {\n  \"react-native-gesture-handler\": <Gesture Handler version>\n}\n\n\nIf you use npm you should add overrides property.\n\n\"overrides\": {\n  \"react-native-gesture-handler\": <Gesture Handler version>\n}\n\n\nAfter that you need to run your package manager again\n\nyarn\n\n\nor\n\nnpm install\n\nAutomatic workletization of gesture callbacks�\n\nReanimated's Babel plugin is setup in a way that automatically marks callbacks passed to gestures in the configuration chain as worklets. This means that as long as all your callbacks are defined in a single chain, you don't need to add a 'worklet'; directive at the beginning of the functions. Here is an example that will be automatically workletized:\n\nconst gesture = Gesture.Tap().onBegin(() => {\n  console.log(_WORKLET);\n});\n\n\nAnd here are some examples that won't:\n\nconst gesture = Gesture.Tap();\ngesture.onBegin(() => {\n  console.log(_WORKLET);\n});\n\nconst callback = () => {\n  console.log(_WORKLET);\n};\nconst gesture = Gesture.Tap().onBegin(callback);\n\nconst callback = () => {\n  console.log(_WORKLET);\n};\nconst gesture = Gesture.Tap();\ngesture.onBegin(callback);\n\n\nIn the above cases, you should add a \"worklet\"; directive at the beginning of the callbacks, like so:\n\nconst callback = () => {\n\n  \"worklet\";\n\n  console.log(_WORKLET);\n};\nconst gesture = Gesture.Tap().onBegin(callback);\n\nconst callback = () => {\n\n  \"worklet\";\n\n  console.log(_WORKLET);\n};\nconst gesture = Gesture.Tap();\ngesture.onBegin(callback);\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nManual gestures\nNEXT\nTesting with Jest\nTroubleshooting\nReporting issues\nIt's not a bug, it's a feature\nMultiple instances of Gesture Handler were detected\nAutomatic workletization of gesture callbacks\n\nRun, preview, and debug your React Native & Expo apps without leaving VSCode.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

It is responsible for creating and updating native gesture handlers based on the config of provided gesture. The most significant difference between it and old gesture handlers is that the GestureDetector can recognize more than one gesture at the time thanks to gesture composition.

Do not forget to remove import for RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView:\n\npackage com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.example;\n\nimport com.facebook.react.ReactActivity;\n- import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;\npublic class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {\n\n-  @Override\n-  protected ReactActivityDelegate createReactActivityDelegate() {\n-    return new ReactActivityDelegate(this, getMainComponentName()) {\n-      @Override\n-      protected ReactRootView createRootView() {\n-       return new RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView(MainActivity.this);\n-      }\n-    };\n-  }\n}\n\nCheck if your app works correctly�\n\nSome libraries (for example React Navigation) already use GestureHandlerRootView as a wrapper to enable gesture interactions. In that case you don't have to add one yourself. If gestures in your app work as expected after removing RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView you can skip the next step.\n\nUpdate your JS code�\n\nInstead of using RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView wrap your entry point with <GestureHandlerRootView>, for example:\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n      {/* content */}\n    </GestureHandlerRootView>\n  );\n}\n\nINFO\n\nNote that GestureHandlerRootView acts like a normal View. So if you want it to fill the screen, you will need to pass { flex: 1 } like you'll need to do with a normal View. By default, it'll take the size of the content nested inside.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nCustom swipeable components inside ScrollView (web)\nNEXT\nUpgrading to the new API introduced in Gesture Handler 2\nUpdate MainActivity.java\nCheck if your app works correctly\nUpdate your JS code\n\nRun, preview, and debug apps faster.\n\nTry our IDE for React Native\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

This class has been the cause of many hard to debug and fix crashed and was deprecated in version 2.0, and subsequently removed in version 2.4. If you are still using it, check out migrating off RNGHEnabledRootView guide.\n\nUpgrading to the new API�\n\nThe most important change brought by the Gesture Handler 2 is the new Gesture API, along with the GestureDetector component. It makes declaring gesture easier, as it handles much of the work under the hood and reduces the amount of necessary boilerplate code. Instead of a separate component for every type of gesture, the GestureDetector component is used to attach gestures to the underlying view based on the configuration object passed to it. The configuration objects are created using the Gesture object, here is a simple example:\n\nconst tapGesture = Gesture.Tap().onStart(() => {\n  console.log('Tap!');\n});\n...\nreturn (\n  <GestureDetector gesture={tapGesture}>\n    <View />\n  </GestureDetector>\n);\n\n\nAs you can see, there are no onGestureEvent and onHandlerStateChange callbacks, instead the state machine is handled under the hood and relevant callbacks are called for specific transitions or events:\n\nonBegin - called when the gesture transitions to the BEGAN state, which in most cases is when the gesture starts processing the touch stream - when the finger first touches the view\nonStart - called when the activation criteria for the gesture are met and it transitions from BEGAN to ACTIVE state\nonUpdate - replaces onGestureEvent, called every time the gesture sends a new event while it's in the ACTIVE state\nonChange - if defined, called just after onUpdate, the events passed to it are the same as the ones passed to onUpdate but they also contain change values which hold the change in value they represent since the last event (i.e. in case of the Pan gesture, the event will also contain changeX and changeY properties)\nonEnd - called when the gesture transitions from the ACTIVE state to either of END, FAILED or CANCELLED - you can tell whether the gesture finished due to user interaction or because of other reason (like getting cancelled by the system, or failure criteria) using the second value passed to the onEnd callback alongside the event\nonFinalize called when the gesture transitions into either of END, FAILED or CANCELLED state, if the gesture was ACTIVE, onEnd will be called first (similarly to onEnd you can determine the reason for finishing using the second argument)\n\nThe difference between onEnd and onFinalize is that the onEnd will be called only if the gesture was ACTIVE, while onFinalize will be called if the gesture has BEGAN. This means that you can use onEnd to clean up after onStart, and onFinalize to clean up after onBegin (or both onBegin and onStart).\n\nConfiguring the gestures�\n\nThe new gesture objects are configured in the builder-like pattern. Instead of properties, each gesture provides methods that allow for its customization. In most cases the names of the methods are the same as the relevant props, or at least very similar. For example:\n\nreturn (\n  <TapGestureHandler\n    numberOfTaps={2}\n    maxDurationMs={500}\n    maxDelayMs={500}\n    maxDist={10}\n    onHandlerStateChange={({ nativeEvent }) => {\n      if (nativeEvent.state === State.ACTIVE) {\n        console.log('Tap!');\n      }\n    }}>\n    <View />\n  </TapGestureHandler>\n);\n\n\nWould have the same effect as:\n\nconst tapGesture = Gesture.Tap()\n  .numberOfTaps(2)\n  .maxDuration(500)\n  .maxDelay(500)\n  .maxDistance(10)\n  .onStart(() => {\n    console.log('Tap!');\n  });\n\nreturn (\n  <GestureDetector gesture={tapGesture}>\n    <View />\n  </GestureDetector>\n);\n\n\nYou can check the modifiers available to specific gestures in the API Reference under Gestures.\n\nUsing multiple gestures on the same view�\n\nUsing the gesture handler components, if you wanted to have multiple gestures on one view, you would have to stack them on top of each other and, in case you wanted to use animations, add an Animated.View after each handler, resulting in a deep component tree, for example:\n\nreturn (\n  <TapGestureHandler ... >\n    <Animated.View>\n      <PanGestureHandler ... >\n        <Animated.View>\n          <PinchGestureHandler ... >\n            <YourView />\n          </PinchGestureHandler>\n        </Animated.View>\n      </PanGestureHandler>\n    </Animated.View>\n  </TapGestureHandler>\n);\n\n\nWith the GestureDetector you can use the Gesture Composition API to stack the gestures onto one view:\n\nconst tapGesture = Gesture.Tap();\nconst panGesture = Gesture.Pan();\nconst pinchGesture = Gesture.Pinch();\n\nreturn (\n  <GestureDetector gesture={Gesture.Race(tapGesture, panGesture, pinchGesture)}>\n    <YourView />\n  </GestureDetector>\n);\n\n\nSimilarly, you can use Gesture.Simultaneous to replace stacked gesture handlers that should be able to recognize gestures simultaneously, and Gesture.Exclusive to replace stacked gesture handlers that require failure of others.\n\nReplacing waitFor and simultaneousHandlers�\n\nIf you want to make relations between the gestures attached to the same view, you should use the Gesture Composition API described above. However, if you want to make a relation between gestures attached to different views, or between gesture and an old gesture handler, you should use simultaneousWithExternalGesture instead of simultaneousHandlers, and requireExternalGestureToFail instead of waitFor. In case you need a ref object to pass to an old gesture handler, you can set it to the gesture using .withRef(refObject) modifier.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nMigrating off RNGHEnabledRootView\nNEXT\nGestures\nMake sure to migrate off the RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView (Android only)\nUpgrading to the new API\nConfiguring the gestures\nUsing multiple gestures on the same view\nReplacing waitFor and simultaneousHandlers\n\nCatch runtime errors right in your editor.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

It provides information about the gesture such as its XY translation from the starting point as well as its instantaneous velocity.\n\nExample�\nTry this example on Snack \nimport { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Gesture, GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nimport Animated, {\n  useSharedValue,\n  withTiming,\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nconst END_POSITION = 200;\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const onLeft = useSharedValue(true);\n  const position = useSharedValue(0);\n\n\n  const panGesture = Gesture.Pan()\n\n    .onUpdate((e) => {\n      if (onLeft.value) {\n        position.value = e.translationX;\n      } else {\n        position.value = END_POSITION + e.translationX;\n      }\n    })\n    .onEnd((e) => {\n      if (position.value > END_POSITION / 2) {\n        position.value = withTiming(END_POSITION, { duration: 100 });\n        onLeft.value = false;\n      } else {\n        position.value = withTiming(0, { duration: 100 });\n        onLeft.value = true;\n      }\n    });\n\n  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    transform: [{ translateX: position.value }],\n  }));\n\n  return (\n\n    <GestureDetector gesture={panGesture}>\n\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyle]} />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  box: {\n    height: 120,\n    width: 120,\n    backgroundColor: '#b58df1',\n    borderRadius: 20,\n    marginBottom: 30,\n  },\n});\n\nMulti touch pan handling�\n\nIf your app relies on multi touch pan handling this section provides some information how the default behavior differs between the platform and how (if necessary) it can be unified.\n\nThe difference in multi touch pan handling lies in the way how translation properties during the event are being calculated. On iOS the default behavior when more than one finger is placed on the screen is to treat this situation as if only one pointer was placed in the center of mass (average position of all the pointers). This applies also to many platform native components that handle touch even if not primarily interested in multi touch interactions like for example UIScrollView component.\n\nOn Android, the default behavior for native components like scroll view, pager views or drawers is different and hence gesture defaults to that when it comes to pan handling. The difference is that instead of treating the center of mass of all the fingers placed as a leading pointer it takes the latest placed finger as such. This behavior can be changed on Android using averageTouches flag.\n\nNote that on both Android and iOS when the additional finger is placed on the screen that translation prop is not affected even though the position of the pointer being tracked might have changed. Therefore it is safe to rely on translation most of the time as it only reflects the movement that happens regardless of how many fingers are placed on the screen and if that number changes over time. If you wish to track the \"center of mass\" virtual pointer and account for its changes when the number of finger changes you can use relative or absolute position provided in the event (x and y or absoluteX and absoluteY).\n\nConfig�\nProperties specific to PanGesture:�\nminDistance(value: number)�\n\nMinimum distance the finger (or multiple finger) need to travel before the gesture activates. Expressed in points.\n\nminPointers(value: number)�\n\nA number of fingers that is required to be placed before gesture can activate. Should be a higher or equal to 0 integer.\n\nmaxPointers(value: number)�\n\nWhen the given number of fingers is placed on the screen and gesture hasn't yet activated it will fail recognizing the gesture. Should be a higher or equal to 0 integer.\n\nactivateAfterLongPress(duration: number)�\n\nDuration in milliseconds of the LongPress gesture before Pan is allowed to activate. If the finger is moved during that period, the gesture will fail. Should be a higher or equal to 0 integer. Default value is 0, meaning no LongPress is required to activate the Pan.\n\nactiveOffsetX(value: number | number[])�\n\nRange along X axis (in points) where fingers travels without activation of gesture. Moving outside of this range implies activation of gesture. Range can be given as an array or a single number. If range is set as an array, first value must be lower or equal to 0, a the second one higher or equal to 0. If only one number p is given a range of (-inf, p) will be used if p is higher or equal to 0 and (-p, inf) otherwise.\n\nactiveOffsetY(value: number | number[])�\n\nRange along Y axis (in points) where fingers travels without activation of gesture. Moving outside of this range implies activation of gesture. Range can be given as an array or a single number. If range is set as an array, first value must be lower or equal to 0, a the second one higher or equal to 0. If only one number p is given a range of (-inf, p) will be used if p is higher or equal to 0 and (-p, inf) otherwise.\n\nfailOffsetY(value: number | number[])�\n\nWhen the finger moves outside this range (in points) along Y axis and gesture hasn't yet activated it will fail recognizing the gesture. Range can be given as an array or a single number. If range is set as an array, first value must be lower or equal to 0, a the second one higher or equal to 0. If only one number p is given a range of (-inf, p) will be used if p is higher or equal to 0 and (-p, inf) otherwise.\n\nfailOffsetX(value: number | number[])�\n\nWhen the finger moves outside this range (in points) along X axis and gesture hasn't yet activated it will fail recognizing the gesture. Range can be given as an array or a single number. If range is set as an array, first value must be lower or equal to 0, a the second one higher or equal to 0. If only one number p is given a range of (-inf, p) will be used if p is higher or equal to 0 and (-p, inf) otherwise.\n\naverageTouches(value: boolean) (Android only)�\n\nAndroid, by default, will calculate translation values based on the position of the leading pointer (the first one that was placed on the screen). This modifier allows that behavior to be changed to the one that is default on iOS - the averaged position of all active pointers will be used to calculate the translation values.\n\nenableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture(value: boolean) (iOS only)�\n\nEnables two-finger gestures on supported devices, for example iPads with trackpads. If not enabled the gesture will require click + drag, with enableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture swiping with two fingers will also trigger the gesture.\n\nmouseButton(value: MouseButton) (Web & Android only)�\n\nAllows users to choose which mouse button should handler respond to. The enum MouseButton consists of the following predefined fields:\n\nLEFT\nRIGHT\nMIDDLE\nBUTTON_4\nBUTTON_5\nALL\n\nArguments can be combined using | operator, e.g. mouseButton(MouseButton.LEFT | MouseButton.RIGHT). Default value is set to MouseButton.LEFT.\n\nProperties common to all gestures:�\nenabled(value: boolean)�\n\nIndicates whether the given handler should be analyzing stream of touch events or not. When set to false we can be sure that the handler's state will never become ACTIVE. If the value gets updated while the handler already started recognizing a gesture, then the handler's state it will immediately change to FAILED or CANCELLED (depending on its current state). Default value is true.\n\nshouldCancelWhenOutside(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen true the handler will cancel or fail recognition (depending on its current state) whenever the finger leaves the area of the connected view. Default value of this property is different depending on the handler type. Most handlers' shouldCancelWhenOutside property defaults to false except for the LongPressGesture and TapGesture which default to true.\n\nhitSlop(settings)�\n\nThis parameter enables control over what part of the connected view area can be used to begin recognizing the gesture. When a negative number is provided the bounds of the view will reduce the area by the given number of points in each of the sides evenly.\n\nInstead you can pass an object to specify how each boundary side should be reduced by providing different number of points for left, right, top or bottom sides. You can alternatively provide horizontal or vertical instead of specifying directly left, right or top and bottom. Finally, the object can also take width and height attributes. When width is set it is only allow to specify one of the sides right or left. Similarly when height is provided only top or bottom can be set. Specifying width or height is useful if we only want the gesture to activate on the edge of the view. In which case for example we can set left: 0 and width: 20 which would make it possible for the gesture to be recognize when started no more than 20 points from the left edge.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this parameter is primarily designed to reduce the area where gesture can activate. Hence it is only supported for all the values (except width and height) to be non positive (0 or lower). Although on Android it is supported for the values to also be positive and therefore allow to expand beyond view bounds but not further than the parent view bounds. To achieve this effect on both platforms you can use React Native's View hitSlop property.\n\nwithRef(ref)�\n\nSets a ref to the gesture object, allowing for interoperability with the old API.\n\nwithTestId(testID)�\n\nSets a testID property for gesture object, allowing for querying for it in tests.\n\ncancelsTouchesInView(value) (iOS only)�\n\nAccepts a boolean value. When true, the gesture will cancel touches for native UI components (UIButton, UISwitch, etc) it's attached to when it becomes ACTIVE. Default value is true.\n\nrunOnJS(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen react-native-reanimated is installed, the callbacks passed to the gestures are automatically workletized and run on the UI thread when called. This option allows for changing this behavior: when true, all the callbacks will be run on the JS thread instead of the UI thread, regardless of whether they are worklets or not. Defaults to false.\n\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a gesture that should be recognized simultaneously with this one.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them. GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nrequireExternalGestureToFail(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation requiring another gesture to fail, before this one can activate.\n\nblocksExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation that makes other gestures wait with activation until this gesture fails (or doesn't start at all).\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them.GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nactiveCursor(value) (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which cursor should be used when gesture activates. Supports all CSS cursor values (e.g. \"grab\", \"zoom-in\"). Default value is set to \"auto\".\n\nProperties common to all continuous gestures:�\nmanualActivation(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen true the handler will not activate by itself even if its activation criteria are met. Instead you can manipulate its state using state manager.\n\nCallbacks�\nCallbacks common to all gestures:�\nonBegin(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when given gesture handler starts receiving touches. At the moment of this callback the handler is not yet in an active state and we don't know yet if it will recognize the gesture at all.\n\nonStart(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the gesture is recognized by the handler and it transitions to the active state.\n\nonEnd(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the gesture that was recognized by the handler finishes. It will be called only if the handler was previously in the active state.\n\nonFinalize(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the handler finalizes handling gesture - the gesture was recognized and has finished or it failed to recognize.\n\nonTouchesDown(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesDown callback which is called every time a finger is placed on the screen.\n\nonTouchesMove(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesMove callback which is called every time a finger is moved on the screen.\n\nonTouchesUp(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesUp callback which is called every time a finger is lifted from the screen.\n\nonTouchesCancelled(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesCancelled callback which is called every time a finger stops being tracked, for example when the gesture finishes.\n\nCallbacks common to all continuous gestures:�\nonUpdate(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called every time the gesture receives an update while it's active.\n\nonChange(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called every time the gesture receives an update while it's active. This callback will receive information about change in value in relation to the last received event.\n\nEvent data�\nEvent attributes specific to PanGesture:�\ntranslationX�\n\nTranslation of the pan gesture along X axis accumulated over the time of the gesture. The value is expressed in the point units.\n\ntranslationY�\n\nTranslation of the pan gesture along Y axis accumulated over the time of the gesture. The value is expressed in the point units.\n\nvelocityX�\n\nVelocity of the pan gesture along the X axis in the current moment. The value is expressed in point units per second.\n\nvelocityY�\n\nVelocity of the pan gesture along the Y axis in the current moment. The value is expressed in point units per second.\n\nx�\n\nX coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the GestureDetector. Expressed in point units.\n\ny�\n\nY coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the GestureDetector. Expressed in point units.\n\nabsoluteX�\n\nX coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of x in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nabsoluteY�\n\nY coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of y in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nstylusData�\n\nObject that contains additional information about stylus. It consists of the following fields:\n\ntiltX - angle in degrees between the Y-Z plane of the stylus and the screen.\ntiltY - angle in degrees between the X-Z plane of the stylus and the screen.\naltitudeAngle - angle between stylus axis and the X-Y plane of a device screen.\nazimuthAngle - angle between the Y-Z plane and the plane containing both the stylus axis and the Y axis.\npressure - indicates the normalized pressure of the stylus.\nEvent attributes common to all gestures:�\nstate�\n\nCurrent state of the handler. Expressed as one of the constants exported under State object by the library.\n\nnumberOfPointers�\n\nRepresents the number of pointers (fingers) currently placed on the screen.\n\npointerType�\n\nIndicates the type of pointer device in use. This value is represented by the PointerType enum, which includes the following fields:\n\nTOUCH - represents finger\nSTYLUS - represents stylus or digital pen\nMOUSE - represents computer mouse\nKEY - represents keyboard\nOTHER - represents unknown device type that is not relevant\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nGesture\nNEXT\nTap gesture\nExample\nMulti touch pan handling\nConfig\nProperties specific to PanGesture:\nminDistance(value: number)\nminPointers(value: number)\nmaxPointers(value: number)\nactivateAfterLongPress(duration: number)\nactiveOffsetX(value: number | number[])\nactiveOffsetY(value: number | number[])\nfailOffsetY(value: number | number[])\nfailOffsetX(value: number | number[])\naverageTouches(value: boolean) (Android only)\nenableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture(value: boolean) (iOS only)\nmouseButton(value: MouseButton) (Web & Android only)\nProperties common to all gestures:\nenabled(value: boolean)\nshouldCancelWhenOutside(value: boolean)\nhitSlop(settings)\nwithRef(ref)\nwithTestId(testID)\ncancelsTouchesInView(value) (iOS only)\nrunOnJS(value: boolean)\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)\nrequireExternalGestureToFail(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)\nblocksExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)\nactiveCursor(value) (Web only)\nProperties common to all continuous gestures:\nmanualActivation(value: boolean)\nCallbacks\nCallbacks common to all gestures:\nonBegin(callback)\nonStart(callback)\nonEnd(callback)\nonFinalize(callback)\nonTouchesDown(callback)\nonTouchesMove(callback)\nonTouchesUp(callback)\nonTouchesCancelled(callback)\nCallbacks common to all continuous gestures:\nonUpdate(callback)\nonChange(callback)\nEvent data\nEvent attributes specific to PanGesture:\ntranslationX\ntranslationY\nvelocityX\nvelocityY\nx\ny\nabsoluteX\nabsoluteY\nstylusData\nEvent attributes common to all gestures:\nstate\nnumberOfPointers\npointerType\n\nRun, preview, and debug apps faster.\n\nTry our IDE for React Native\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

It is responsible for creating and updating native gesture handlers based on the config of provided gesture. The most significant difference between it and old gesture handlers is that the GestureDetector can recognize more than one gesture at the time thanks to gesture composition. Keep in mind that GestureDetector is not compatible with the Animated API, nor with Reanimated 1.\n\nReference�\nimport { Gesture, GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const tap = Gesture.Tap();\n  return (\n\n    <GestureDetector gesture={tap}>\n\n      <Animated.View />\n\n    </GestureDetector>\n\n  );\n}\n\nProperties�\ngesture�\n\nA gesture object containing the configuration and callbacks. Can be any of the base gestures (Tap, Pan, LongPress, Fling, Pinch, Rotation, ForceTouch) or any ComposedGesture (Race, Simultaneous, Exclusive).\n\nINFO\n\nGestureDetector will decide whether to use Reanimated to process provided gestures based on callbacks they have. If any of the callbacks is a worklet, tools provided by the Reanimated will be utilized bringing ability to handle gestures synchronously.\n\nStarting with Reanimated 2.3.0 Gesture Handler will provide a StateManager in the touch events that allows for managing the state of the gesture.\n\nuserSelect (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which userSelect property should be applied to underlying view. Possible values are \"none\" | \"auto\" | \"text\". Default value is set to \"none\".\n\ntouchAction (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which touchAction property should be applied to underlying view. Supports all CSS touch-action values (e.g. \"none\", \"pan-y\"). Default value is set to \"none\".\n\nenableContextMenu(value: boolean) (Web only)�\n\nSpecifies whether context menu should be enabled after clicking on underlying view with right mouse button. Default value is set to false.\n\nRemarks�\n\nGesture Detector will use first native view in its subtree to recognize gestures, however if this view is used only to group its children it may get automatically collapsed. Consider this example:\n\nexport default function Example() {\n  const tap = Gesture.Tap().onStart(() => {\n    console.log('tap');\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={tap}>\n      <FunctionalComponent>\n        <View style={styles.box} />\n      </FunctionalComponent>\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction FunctionalComponent(props) {\n  return <View collapsable={false}>{props.children}</View>;\n}\n\n\nIf we were to remove the collapsable prop from the View, the gesture would stop working because it would be attached to a view that is not present in the view hierarchy. Gesture Detector adds this prop automatically to its direct child but it's impossible to do automatically for more complex view trees.\n\nUsing the same instance of a gesture across multiple Gesture Detectors is not possible. Have a look at the code below:\n\nexport default function Example() {\n  const pan = Gesture.Pan();\n\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <GestureDetector gesture={pan}>\n        <View>\n          <GestureDetector gesture={pan}> {/* Don't do this! */}\n            <View />\n          </GestureDetector>\n        </View>\n      </GestureDetector>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\n\nThis example will throw an error, becuse we try to use the same instance of Pan in two different Gesture Detectors.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nGestures\nNEXT\nGesture\nReference\nProperties\ngesture\nuserSelect (Web only)\ntouchAction (Web only)\nenableContextMenu(value: boolean) (Web only)\nRemarks\n\nPreview React Native components in isolation.\n\nTry Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

This gesture's state will turn into END immediately after the finger is released. The gesture will fail to recognize a touch event if the finger is lifted before the minimum required time or if the finger is moved further than the allowable distance.\n\nExample�\nTry this example on Snack \nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Gesture, GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const longPressGesture = Gesture.LongPress().onEnd((e, success) => {\n\n    if (success) {\n      console.log(`Long pressed for ${e.duration} ms!`);\n    }\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={longPressGesture}>\n      <View style={styles.box} />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  box: {\n    height: 120,\n    width: 120,\n    backgroundColor: '#b58df1',\n    borderRadius: 20,\n    marginBottom: 30,\n  },\n});\n\nConfig�\nProperties specific to LongPressGesture:�\nminDuration(value: number)�\n\nMinimum time, expressed in milliseconds, that a finger must remain pressed on the corresponding view. The default value is 500.\n\nmaxDistance(value: number)�\n\nMaximum distance, expressed in points, that defines how far the finger is allowed to travel during a long press gesture. If the finger travels further than the defined distance and the gesture hasn't yet activated, it will fail to recognize the gesture. The default value is 10.\n\nmouseButton(value: MouseButton) (Web & Android only)�\n\nAllows users to choose which mouse button should handler respond to. The enum MouseButton consists of the following predefined fields:\n\nLEFT\nRIGHT\nMIDDLE\nBUTTON_4\nBUTTON_5\nALL\n\nArguments can be combined using | operator, e.g. mouseButton(MouseButton.LEFT | MouseButton.RIGHT). Default value is set to MouseButton.LEFT.\n\nProperties common to all gestures:�\nenabled(value: boolean)�\n\nIndicates whether the given handler should be analyzing stream of touch events or not. When set to false we can be sure that the handler's state will never become ACTIVE. If the value gets updated while the handler already started recognizing a gesture, then the handler's state it will immediately change to FAILED or CANCELLED (depending on its current state). Default value is true.\n\nshouldCancelWhenOutside(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen true the handler will cancel or fail recognition (depending on its current state) whenever the finger leaves the area of the connected view. Default value of this property is different depending on the handler type. Most handlers' shouldCancelWhenOutside property defaults to false except for the LongPressGesture and TapGesture which default to true.\n\nhitSlop(settings)�\n\nThis parameter enables control over what part of the connected view area can be used to begin recognizing the gesture. When a negative number is provided the bounds of the view will reduce the area by the given number of points in each of the sides evenly.\n\nInstead you can pass an object to specify how each boundary side should be reduced by providing different number of points for left, right, top or bottom sides. You can alternatively provide horizontal or vertical instead of specifying directly left, right or top and bottom. Finally, the object can also take width and height attributes. When width is set it is only allow to specify one of the sides right or left. Similarly when height is provided only top or bottom can be set. Specifying width or height is useful if we only want the gesture to activate on the edge of the view. In which case for example we can set left: 0 and width: 20 which would make it possible for the gesture to be recognize when started no more than 20 points from the left edge.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this parameter is primarily designed to reduce the area where gesture can activate. Hence it is only supported for all the values (except width and height) to be non positive (0 or lower). Although on Android it is supported for the values to also be positive and therefore allow to expand beyond view bounds but not further than the parent view bounds. To achieve this effect on both platforms you can use React Native's View hitSlop property.\n\nwithRef(ref)�\n\nSets a ref to the gesture object, allowing for interoperability with the old API.\n\nwithTestId(testID)�\n\nSets a testID property for gesture object, allowing for querying for it in tests.\n\ncancelsTouchesInView(value) (iOS only)�\n\nAccepts a boolean value. When true, the gesture will cancel touches for native UI components (UIButton, UISwitch, etc) it's attached to when it becomes ACTIVE. Default value is true.\n\nrunOnJS(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen react-native-reanimated is installed, the callbacks passed to the gestures are automatically workletized and run on the UI thread when called. This option allows for changing this behavior: when true, all the callbacks will be run on the JS thread instead of the UI thread, regardless of whether they are worklets or not. Defaults to false.\n\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a gesture that should be recognized simultaneously with this one.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them. GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nrequireExternalGestureToFail(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation requiring another gesture to fail, before this one can activate.\n\nblocksExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation that makes other gestures wait with activation until this gesture fails (or doesn't start at all).\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them.GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nactiveCursor(value) (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which cursor should be used when gesture activates. Supports all CSS cursor values (e.g. \"grab\", \"zoom-in\"). Default value is set to \"auto\".\n\nCallbacks�\nCallbacks common to all gestures:�\nonBegin(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when given gesture handler starts receiving touches. At the moment of this callback the handler is not yet in an active state and we don't know yet if it will recognize the gesture at all.\n\nonStart(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the gesture is recognized by the handler and it transitions to the active state.\n\nonEnd(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the gesture that was recognized by the handler finishes. It will be called only if the handler was previously in the active state.\n\nonFinalize(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the handler finalizes handling gesture - the gesture was recognized and has finished or it failed to recognize.\n\nonTouchesDown(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesDown callback which is called every time a finger is placed on the screen.\n\nonTouchesMove(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesMove callback which is called every time a finger is moved on the screen.\n\nonTouchesUp(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesUp callback which is called every time a finger is lifted from the screen.\n\nonTouchesCancelled(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesCancelled callback which is called every time a finger stops being tracked, for example when the gesture finishes.\n\nEvent data�\nEvent attributes specific to LongPressGesture:�\nx�\n\nX coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the GestureDetector.\n\ny�\n\nY coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the GestureDetector.\n\nabsoluteX�\n\nX coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. It is recommended to use absoluteX instead of x in cases when the view attached to the GestureDetector can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nabsoluteY�\n\nY coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window.

The fingers involved in these gestures must not move significantly from their initial touch positions. The required number of taps and allowed distance from initial position may be configured. For example, you might configure tap gesture recognizers to detect single taps, double taps, or triple taps.\n\nIn order for a gesture to activate, specified gesture requirements such as minPointers, numberOfTaps, maxDist, maxDuration, and maxDelayMs (explained below) must be met. Immediately after the gesture activates, it will end.\n\nExample�\nTry this example on Snack \nimport { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Gesture, GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const singleTap = Gesture.Tap()\n\n    .maxDuration(250)\n    .onStart(() => {\n      console.log('Single tap!');\n    });\n\n\n  const doubleTap = Gesture.Tap()\n\n    .maxDuration(250)\n    .numberOfTaps(2)\n    .onStart(() => {\n      console.log('Double tap!');\n    });\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={Gesture.Exclusive(doubleTap, singleTap)}>\n      <View style={styles.box} />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  box: {\n    height: 120,\n    width: 120,\n    backgroundColor: '#b58df1',\n    borderRadius: 20,\n    marginBottom: 30,\n  },\n});\n\nConfig�\nProperties specific to TapGesture:�\nminPointers(value: number)�\n\nMinimum number of pointers (fingers) required to be placed before the gesture activates.

Gesture gets ACTIVE when movement is sufficiently long and it does not take too much time. When gesture gets activated it will turn into END state when finger is released. The gesture will fail to recognize if the finger is lifted before being activated.\n\nExample�\nTry this example on Snack \nimport { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport {\n  Gesture,\n  GestureDetector,\n  Directions,\n} from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nimport Animated, {\n  useSharedValue,\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n  withTiming,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const position = useSharedValue(0);\n\n  const flingGesture = Gesture.Fling()\n\n    .direction(Directions.RIGHT)\n    .onStart((e) => {\n      position.value = withTiming(position.value + 10, { duration: 100 });\n    });\n\n  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    transform: [{ translateX: position.value }],\n  }));\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={flingGesture}>\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyle]} />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  box: {\n    height: 120,\n    width: 120,\n    backgroundColor: '#b58df1',\n    borderRadius: 20,\n    marginBottom: 30,\n  },\n});\n\nConfig�\nProperties specific to FlingGesture:�\ndirection(value: Directions)�\n\nExpressed allowed direction of movement. Expected values are exported as constants in the Directions object. It's possible to pass one or many directions in one parameter:\n\nimport { Directions } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nfling.direction(Directions.RIGHT | Directions.LEFT);\n\n\nor\n\nfling.direction(Directions.DOWN);\n\nnumberOfPointers(value: number)�\n\nDetermine exact number of points required to handle the fling gesture.\n\nmouseButton(value: MouseButton) (Web & Android only)�\n\nAllows users to choose which mouse button should handler respond to. The enum MouseButton consists of the following predefined fields:\n\nLEFT\nRIGHT\nMIDDLE\nBUTTON_4\nBUTTON_5\nALL\n\nArguments can be combined using | operator, e.g. mouseButton(MouseButton.LEFT | MouseButton.RIGHT). Default value is set to MouseButton.LEFT.\n\nProperties common to all gestures:�\nenabled(value: boolean)�\n\nIndicates whether the given handler should be analyzing stream of touch events or not. When set to false we can be sure that the handler's state will never become ACTIVE. If the value gets updated while the handler already started recognizing a gesture, then the handler's state it will immediately change to FAILED or CANCELLED (depending on its current state). Default value is true.\n\nshouldCancelWhenOutside(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen true the handler will cancel or fail recognition (depending on its current state) whenever the finger leaves the area of the connected view. Default value of this property is different depending on the handler type. Most handlers' shouldCancelWhenOutside property defaults to false except for the LongPressGesture and TapGesture which default to true.\n\nhitSlop(settings)�\n\nThis parameter enables control over what part of the connected view area can be used to begin recognizing the gesture. When a negative number is provided the bounds of the view will reduce the area by the given number of points in each of the sides evenly.\n\nInstead you can pass an object to specify how each boundary side should be reduced by providing different number of points for left, right, top or bottom sides. You can alternatively provide horizontal or vertical instead of specifying directly left, right or top and bottom. Finally, the object can also take width and height attributes. When width is set it is only allow to specify one of the sides right or left. Similarly when height is provided only top or bottom can be set. Specifying width or height is useful if we only want the gesture to activate on the edge of the view. In which case for example we can set left: 0 and width: 20 which would make it possible for the gesture to be recognize when started no more than 20 points from the left edge.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this parameter is primarily designed to reduce the area where gesture can activate. Hence it is only supported for all the values (except width and height) to be non positive (0 or lower). Although on Android it is supported for the values to also be positive and therefore allow to expand beyond view bounds but not further than the parent view bounds. To achieve this effect on both platforms you can use React Native's View hitSlop property.\n\nwithRef(ref)�\n\nSets a ref to the gesture object, allowing for interoperability with the old API.\n\nwithTestId(testID)�\n\nSets a testID property for gesture object, allowing for querying for it in tests.\n\ncancelsTouchesInView(value) (iOS only)�\n\nAccepts a boolean value. When true, the gesture will cancel touches for native UI components (UIButton, UISwitch, etc) it's attached to when it becomes ACTIVE. Default value is true.\n\nrunOnJS(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen react-native-reanimated is installed, the callbacks passed to the gestures are automatically workletized and run on the UI thread when called. This option allows for changing this behavior: when true, all the callbacks will be run on the JS thread instead of the UI thread, regardless of whether they are worklets or not. Defaults to false.\n\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a gesture that should be recognized simultaneously with this one.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them. GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nrequireExternalGestureToFail(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation requiring another gesture to fail, before this one can activate.\n\nblocksExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation that makes other gestures wait with activation until this gesture fails (or doesn't start at all).\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them.GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nactiveCursor(value) (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which cursor should be used when gesture activates. Supports all CSS cursor values (e.g. \"grab\", \"zoom-in\"). Default value is set to \"auto\".\n\nCallbacks�\nCallbacks common to all gestures:�\nonBegin(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when given gesture handler starts receiving touches.

It will be called only if the handler was previously in the active state.\n\nonFinalize(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the handler finalizes handling gesture - the gesture was recognized and has finished or it failed to recognize.\n\nonTouchesDown(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesDown callback which is called every time a finger is placed on the screen.\n\nonTouchesMove(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesMove callback which is called every time a finger is moved on the screen.\n\nonTouchesUp(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesUp callback which is called every time a finger is lifted from the screen.\n\nonTouchesCancelled(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesCancelled callback which is called every time a finger stops being tracked, for example when the gesture finishes.\n\nEvent data�\nEvent attributes specific to FlingGesture:�\nx�\n\nX coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the GestureDetector.

It allows for tracking the distance between two fingers and use that information to scale or zoom your content. The gesture activates when fingers are placed on the screen and change their position. Gesture callback can be used for continuous tracking of the pinch gesture. It provides information about velocity, anchor (focal) point of gesture and scale.\n\nThe distance between the fingers is reported as a scale factor. At the beginning of the gesture, the scale factor is 1.0. As the distance between the two fingers increases, the scale factor increases proportionally. Similarly, the scale factor decreases as the distance between the fingers decreases. Pinch gestures are used most commonly to change the size of objects or content onscreen. For example, map views use pinch gestures to change the zoom level of the map.\n\nExample�\nTry this example on Snack \nimport { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Gesture, GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nimport Animated, {\n  useSharedValue,\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const scale = useSharedValue(1);\n  const savedScale = useSharedValue(1);\n\n\n  const pinchGesture = Gesture.Pinch()\n\n    .onUpdate((e) => {\n      scale.value = savedScale.value * e.scale;\n    })\n    .onEnd(() => {\n      savedScale.value = scale.value;\n    });\n\n  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    transform: [{ scale: scale.value }],\n  }));\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={pinchGesture}>\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyle]} />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  box: {\n    height: 120,\n    width: 120,\n    backgroundColor: '#b58df1',\n    borderRadius: 20,\n    marginBottom: 30,\n  },\n});\n\nRemarks�\nWhen implementing pinch based on focal point, make sure to use it after gesture has activated, i.e. in onStart, onUpdate or onChange callbacks. Using it in onBegan may lead to unexpected behavior.\nConfig�\nProperties common to all gestures:�\nenabled(value: boolean)�\n\nIndicates whether the given handler should be analyzing stream of touch events or not.

The hover effect may be activated by moving a mouse or a stylus over the view.\n\nOn iOS additional visual effects may be configured.\n\nReference�\nTry this example on Snack \nimport { GestureDetector, Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const hover = Gesture.Hover();\n\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={hover}>\n      <View />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nRemarks�\nDon't rely on Hover gesture to continue after the mouse button is clicked or the stylus touches the screen. If you want to handle both cases, compose it with Pan gesture.\nConfig�\nProperties specific to HoverGesture:�\neffect(effect: HoverEffect) (iOS only)�\nimport { HoverEffect } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\n\nVisual effect applied to the view while the view is hovered. The possible values are:\n\nHoverEffect.None\nHoverEffect.Lift\nHoverEffect.Highlight\n\nDefaults to HoverEffect.None\n\nProperties common to all gestures:�\nenabled(value: boolean)�\n\nIndicates whether the given handler should be analyzing stream of touch events or not. When set to false we can be sure that the handler's state will never become ACTIVE. If the value gets updated while the handler already started recognizing a gesture, then the handler's state it will immediately change to FAILED or CANCELLED (depending on its current state). Default value is true.\n\nshouldCancelWhenOutside(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen true the handler will cancel or fail recognition (depending on its current state) whenever the finger leaves the area of the connected view. Default value of this property is different depending on the handler type. Most handlers' shouldCancelWhenOutside property defaults to false except for the LongPressGesture and TapGesture which default to true.\n\nhitSlop(settings)�\n\nThis parameter enables control over what part of the connected view area can be used to begin recognizing the gesture. When a negative number is provided the bounds of the view will reduce the area by the given number of points in each of the sides evenly.\n\nInstead you can pass an object to specify how each boundary side should be reduced by providing different number of points for left, right, top or bottom sides. You can alternatively provide horizontal or vertical instead of specifying directly left, right or top and bottom. Finally, the object can also take width and height attributes. When width is set it is only allow to specify one of the sides right or left. Similarly when height is provided only top or bottom can be set. Specifying width or height is useful if we only want the gesture to activate on the edge of the view. In which case for example we can set left: 0 and width: 20 which would make it possible for the gesture to be recognize when started no more than 20 points from the left edge.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this parameter is primarily designed to reduce the area where gesture can activate. Hence it is only supported for all the values (except width and height) to be non positive (0 or lower). Although on Android it is supported for the values to also be positive and therefore allow to expand beyond view bounds but not further than the parent view bounds. To achieve this effect on both platforms you can use React Native's View hitSlop property.\n\nwithRef(ref)�\n\nSets a ref to the gesture object, allowing for interoperability with the old API.\n\nwithTestId(testID)�\n\nSets a testID property for gesture object, allowing for querying for it in tests.\n\ncancelsTouchesInView(value) (iOS only)�\n\nAccepts a boolean value. When true, the gesture will cancel touches for native UI components (UIButton, UISwitch, etc) it's attached to when it becomes ACTIVE. Default value is true.\n\nrunOnJS(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen react-native-reanimated is installed, the callbacks passed to the gestures are automatically workletized and run on the UI thread when called. This option allows for changing this behavior: when true, all the callbacks will be run on the JS thread instead of the UI thread, regardless of whether they are worklets or not. Defaults to false.\n\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a gesture that should be recognized simultaneously with this one.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them. GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nrequireExternalGestureToFail(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation requiring another gesture to fail, before this one can activate.\n\nblocksExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation that makes other gestures wait with activation until this gesture fails (or doesn't start at all).\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them.GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nactiveCursor(value) (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which cursor should be used when gesture activates. Supports all CSS cursor values (e.g. \"grab\", \"zoom-in\"). Default value is set to \"auto\".\n\nCallbacks�\nCallbacks common to all gestures:�\nonBegin(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when given gesture handler starts receiving touches. At the moment of this callback the handler is not yet in an active state and we don't know yet if it will recognize the gesture at all.\n\nonStart(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the gesture is recognized by the handler and it transitions to the active state.\n\nonEnd(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the gesture that was recognized by the handler finishes. It will be called only if the handler was previously in the active state.\n\nonFinalize(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the handler finalizes handling gesture - the gesture was recognized and has finished or it failed to recognize.\n\nonTouchesDown(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesDown callback which is called every time a finger is placed on the screen.\n\nonTouchesMove(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesMove callback which is called every time a finger is moved on the screen.\n\nonTouchesUp(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesUp callback which is called every time a finger is lifted from the screen.\n\nonTouchesCancelled(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesCancelled callback which is called every time a finger stops being tracked, for example when the gesture finishes.\n\nCallbacks common to all continuous gestures:�\nonUpdate(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called every time the gesture receives an update while it's active.\n\nonChange(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called every time the gesture receives an update while it's active. This callback will receive information about change in value in relation to the last received event.\n\nEvent data�\nEvent attributes specific to HoverGesture:�\nx�\n\nX coordinate of the current position of the pointer relative to the view attached to the GestureDetector.

The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of y in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nstylusData�\n\nObject that contains additional information about stylus.

It allows for tracking pressure of touch on some iOS devices. The gesture activates when pressure of touch is greater than or equal to minForce. It fails if pressure is greater than maxForce. Gesture callback can be used for continuous tracking of the touch pressure. It provides information for one finger (the first one).\n\nAt the beginning of the gesture, the pressure factor is 0.0. As the pressure increases, the pressure factor increases proportionally. The maximum pressure is 1.0.\n\nThere's no implementation provided on Android and it simply renders children without any wrappers. Since this behaviour is only provided on some iOS devices, this gesture should not be used for defining any crucial behaviors. Use it only as an additional improvement and make all features to be accessed without this gesture as well.\n\nReference�\nimport { GestureDetector, Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const forceTouch = Gesture.ForceTouch();\n\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={forceTouch}>\n      <View />\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nConfig�\nProperties specific to ForceTouchGesture:�\nminForce(value: number)�\n\nA minimal pressure that is required before gesture can activate. Should be a value from range [0.0, 1.0]. Default is 0.2.\n\nmaxForce(value: number)�\n\nA maximal pressure that could be applied for gesture. If the pressure is greater, gesture fails. Should be a value from range [0.0, 1.0].\n\nfeedbackOnActivation(value: boolean)�\n\nValue defining if haptic feedback has to be performed on activation.\n\nProperties common to all gestures:�\nenabled(value: boolean)�\n\nIndicates whether the given handler should be analyzing stream of touch events or not.

This streamlines interactions between gestures and the native component, allowing it to form relations with other gestures.\n\nWhen used, the native component should be the direct child of a GestureDetector.\n\nExample�\n\nThis example renders a ScrollView with multiple colored rectangles, where each rectangle has a black section. Starting a touch on a black section will disable the ScrollView for the duration of the Pan gesture.\n\nimport { View, ScrollView } from 'react-native';\nimport { Gesture, GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nconst COLORS = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple', 'orange', 'cyan'];\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const native = Gesture.Native();\n\n\n  return (\n    <GestureDetector gesture={native}>\n      <ScrollView style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n        <ScrollableContent scrollGesture={native} />\n      </ScrollView>\n    </GestureDetector>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ScrollableContent({ scrollGesture }) {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      {COLORS.map((color) => (\n        <Rectangle key={color} color={color} scrollGesture={scrollGesture} />\n      ))}\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Rectangle({ color, scrollGesture }) {\n  const pan = Gesture.Pan().blocksExternalGesture(scrollGesture);\n\n  return (\n    <View\n      key={color}\n      style={{ width: '100%', height: 250, backgroundColor: color }}>\n      <GestureDetector gesture={pan}>\n        <View style={{ width: '100%', height: 50, backgroundColor: 'black' }} />\n      </GestureDetector>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nRemarks�\nNative gesture can be used as part of gesture composition and cross-component interactions just like any other gesture. You can use this to block a native component for the duration of the gesture or to make it work alongside a gesture.\nDANGER\n\nDo not use Native gesture with components exported by React Native Gesture Handler. Those come with a native gesture handler preapplied. Attaching a native gesture twice will likely result in the components not working as intended.\n\nConfig�\nProperties specific to NativeGesture:�\nshouldActivateOnStart(value: boolean) (Android only)�\n\nWhen true, underlying handler will activate unconditionally when it receives any touches in BEGAN or UNDETERMINED state.\n\ndisallowInterruption(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen true, cancels all other gesture handlers when this NativeViewGestureHandler changes its state to ACTIVE.\n\nProperties common to all gestures:�\nenabled(value: boolean)�\n\nIndicates whether the given handler should be analyzing stream of touch events or not. When set to false we can be sure that the handler's state will never become ACTIVE. If the value gets updated while the handler already started recognizing a gesture, then the handler's state it will immediately change to FAILED or CANCELLED (depending on its current state). Default value is true.\n\nshouldCancelWhenOutside(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen true the handler will cancel or fail recognition (depending on its current state) whenever the finger leaves the area of the connected view. Default value of this property is different depending on the handler type. Most handlers' shouldCancelWhenOutside property defaults to false except for the LongPressGesture and TapGesture which default to true.\n\nhitSlop(settings)�\n\nThis parameter enables control over what part of the connected view area can be used to begin recognizing the gesture. When a negative number is provided the bounds of the view will reduce the area by the given number of points in each of the sides evenly.\n\nInstead you can pass an object to specify how each boundary side should be reduced by providing different number of points for left, right, top or bottom sides. You can alternatively provide horizontal or vertical instead of specifying directly left, right or top and bottom. Finally, the object can also take width and height attributes. When width is set it is only allow to specify one of the sides right or left. Similarly when height is provided only top or bottom can be set. Specifying width or height is useful if we only want the gesture to activate on the edge of the view. In which case for example we can set left: 0 and width: 20 which would make it possible for the gesture to be recognize when started no more than 20 points from the left edge.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this parameter is primarily designed to reduce the area where gesture can activate. Hence it is only supported for all the values (except width and height) to be non positive (0 or lower). Although on Android it is supported for the values to also be positive and therefore allow to expand beyond view bounds but not further than the parent view bounds. To achieve this effect on both platforms you can use React Native's View hitSlop property.\n\nwithRef(ref)�\n\nSets a ref to the gesture object, allowing for interoperability with the old API.\n\nwithTestId(testID)�\n\nSets a testID property for gesture object, allowing for querying for it in tests.\n\ncancelsTouchesInView(value) (iOS only)�\n\nAccepts a boolean value. When true, the gesture will cancel touches for native UI components (UIButton, UISwitch, etc) it's attached to when it becomes ACTIVE. Default value is true.\n\nrunOnJS(value: boolean)�\n\nWhen react-native-reanimated is installed, the callbacks passed to the gestures are automatically workletized and run on the UI thread when called. This option allows for changing this behavior: when true, all the callbacks will be run on the JS thread instead of the UI thread, regardless of whether they are worklets or not. Defaults to false.\n\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a gesture that should be recognized simultaneously with this one.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them. GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nrequireExternalGestureToFail(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation requiring another gesture to fail, before this one can activate.\n\nblocksExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)�\n\nAdds a relation that makes other gestures wait with activation until this gesture fails (or doesn't start at all).\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this method only marks the relation between gestures, without composing them.GestureDetector will not recognize the otherGestures and it needs to be added to another detector in order to be recognized.\n\nactiveCursor(value) (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which cursor should be used when gesture activates. Supports all CSS cursor values (e.g. \"grab\", \"zoom-in\"). Default value is set to \"auto\".\n\nCallbacks�\nCallbacks common to all gestures:�\nonBegin(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when given gesture handler starts receiving touches. At the moment of this callback the handler is not yet in an active state and we don't know yet if it will recognize the gesture at all.\n\nonStart(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the gesture is recognized by the handler and it transitions to the active state.\n\nonEnd(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the gesture that was recognized by the handler finishes. It will be called only if the handler was previously in the active state.\n\nonFinalize(callback)�\n\nSet the callback that is being called when the handler finalizes handling gesture - the gesture was recognized and has finished or it failed to recognize.\n\nonTouchesDown(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesDown callback which is called every time a finger is placed on the screen.\n\nonTouchesMove(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesMove callback which is called every time a finger is moved on the screen.\n\nonTouchesUp(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesUp callback which is called every time a finger is lifted from the screen.\n\nonTouchesCancelled(callback)�\n\nSet the onTouchesCancelled callback which is called every time a finger stops being tracked, for example when the gesture finishes.\n\nEvent data�\nEvent attributes specific to NativeGesture:�\npointerInside�\n\nTrue if gesture was performed inside of containing view, false otherwise.\n\nEvent attributes common to all gestures:�\nstate�\n\nCurrent state of the handler. Expressed as one of the constants exported under State object by the library.\n\nnumberOfPointers�\n\nRepresents the number of pointers (fingers) currently placed on the screen.\n\npointerType�\n\nIndicates the type of pointer device in use. This value is represented by the PointerType enum, which includes the following fields:\n\nTOUCH - represents finger\nSTYLUS - represents stylus or digital pen\nMOUSE - represents computer mouse\nKEY - represents keyboard\nOTHER - represents unknown device type that is not relevant\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nForce touch gesture\nNEXT\nManual gesture\nExample\nRemarks\nConfig\nProperties specific to NativeGesture:\nshouldActivateOnStart(value: boolean) (Android only)\ndisallowInterruption(value: boolean)\nProperties common to all gestures:\nenabled(value: boolean)\nshouldCancelWhenOutside(value: boolean)\nhitSlop(settings)\nwithRef(ref)\nwithTestId(testID)\ncancelsTouchesInView(value) (iOS only)\nrunOnJS(value: boolean)\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)\nrequireExternalGestureToFail(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)\nblocksExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)\nactiveCursor(value) (Web only)\nCallbacks\nCallbacks common to all gestures:\nonBegin(callback)\nonStart(callback)\nonEnd(callback)\nonFinalize(callback)\nonTouchesDown(callback)\nonTouchesMove(callback)\nonTouchesUp(callback)\nonTouchesCancelled(callback)\nEvent data\nEvent attributes specific to NativeGesture:\npointerInside\nEvent attributes common to all gestures:\nstate\nnumberOfPointers\npointerType\n\nRun, preview, and debug your React Native & Expo apps without leaving VSCode.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Please use the reanimated version.\n\nThis is a cross-platform replacement for React Native's DrawerLayoutAndroid component. It provides a compatible API but allows for the component to be used on both Android and iOS. Please refer to React Native docs for the detailed usage for standard parameters.\n\nUsage:�\n\nDrawerLayout component isn't exported by default from the react-native-gesture-handler package. To use it, import it in the following way:\n\nimport DrawerLayout from 'react-native-gesture-handler/DrawerLayout';\n\nProperties:�\n\nOn top of the standard list of parameters DrawerLayout has an additional set of attributes to customize its behavior. Please refer to the list below:\n\ndrawerType�\n\npossible values are: front, back or slide (default is front). It specifies the way the drawer will be displayed. When set to front the drawer will slide in and out along with the gesture and will display on top of the content view. When back is used the drawer displays behind the content view and can be revealed with gesture of pulling the content view to the side. Finally slide option makes the drawer appear like it is attached to the side of the content view; when you pull both content view and drawer will follow the gesture.\n\nType slide:\n\nType front:\n\nType back:\n\nedgeWidth�\n\nnumber, allows for defining how far from the edge of the content view the gesture should activate.\n\nhideStatusBar�\n\nboolean, when set to true Drawer component will use StatusBar API to hide the OS status bar whenever the drawer is pulled or when its in an \"open\" state.\n\nstatusBarAnimation�\n\npossible values are: slide, none or fade (defaults to slide). Can be used when hideStatusBar is set to true and will select the animation used for hiding/showing the status bar. See StatusBar documentation for more details.\n\noverlayColor�\n\ncolor (default to \"black\") of a semi-transparent overlay to be displayed on top of the content view when drawer gets open. A solid color should be used as the opacity is added by the Drawer itself and the opacity of the overlay is animated (from 0% to 70%).\n\nrenderNavigationView�\n\nfunction. This attribute is present in the standard implementation already and is one of the required params. Gesture handler version of DrawerLayout make it possible for the function passed as renderNavigationView to take an Animated value as a parameter that indicates the progress of drawer opening/closing animation (progress value is 0 when closed and 1 when opened). This can be used by the drawer component to animated its children while the drawer is opening or closing.\n\nonDrawerClose�\n\nfunction. This function is called when the drawer is closed.\n\nonDrawerOpen�\n\nfunction. This function is called when the drawer is opened.\n\nonDrawerSlide�\n\nfunction. This function is called as a drawer sliding open from touch events. The progress of the drawer opening/closing is passed back as 0 when closed and 1 when opened.\n\nonDrawerStateChanged�\n\nfunction. This function is called when the status of the drawer changes. It takes two arguments:\n\nnewState: DrawerState - state of the Drawer. It can be one of the following:\nIdle\nDragging\nSettling\ndrawerWillShow: boolean - if true, Drawer is about to open.\nenableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture (iOS only)�\n\nEnables two-finger gestures on supported devices, for example iPads with trackpads. If not enabled the gesture will require click + drag, with enableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture swiping with two fingers will also trigger the gesture.\n\nchildren�\n\ncomponent or function. Children is a component which is rendered by default and is wrapped by drawer. However, it could be also a render function which takes an Animated value as a parameter that indicates the progress of drawer opening/closing animation (progress value is 0 when closed and 1 when opened) is the same way like renderNavigationView prop.\n\nmouseButton(value: MouseButton) (Web & Android only)�\n\nAllows users to choose which mouse button should handler respond to. The enum MouseButton consists of the following predefined fields:\n\nLEFT\nRIGHT\nMIDDLE\nBUTTON_4\nBUTTON_5\nALL\n\nArguments can be combined using | operator, e.g. mouseButton(MouseButton.LEFT | MouseButton.RIGHT). Default value is set to MouseButton.LEFT.\n\nenableContextMenu(value: boolean) (Web only)�\n\nSpecifies whether context menu should be enabled after clicking on underlying view with right mouse button. Default value is set to false.\n\nMethods�\nopenDrawer(options)�\n\nopenDrawer can take an optional options parameter which is an object, enabling further customization of the open animation.\n\noptions has two optional properties:\n\nvelocity: number, the initial velocity of the object attached to the spring. Default 0 (object is at rest). speed: number, controls speed of the animation. Default 12.\n\ncloseDrawer(options)�\n\ncloseDrawer can take an optional options parameter which is an object, enabling further customization of the close animation.\n\noptions has two optional properties:\n\nvelocity: number, the initial velocity of the object attached to the spring.

These can be treated as a replacement to TouchableHighlight or TouchableOpacity from RN core. Gesture handler's buttons recognize touches in native which makes the recognition process deterministic, allows for rendering ripples on Android in highly performant way (TouchableNativeFeedback requires that touch event does a roundtrip to JS before we can update ripple effect, which makes ripples lag a bit on older phones), and provides native and platform default interaction for buttons that are placed in a scrollable container (in which case the interaction is slightly delayed to prevent button from highlighting when you fling).\n\nCurrently Gesture handler library exposes three components that render native touchable elements under the hood:\n\nBaseButton\nRectButton\nBorderlessButton\n\nOn top of that all the buttons are wrapped with NativeViewGestureHandler and therefore allow for all the common gesture handler properties and NativeViewGestureHandler's extra properties to be applied to them.\n\nIMPORTANT: In order to make buttons accessible, you have to wrap your children in a View with accessible and accessibilityRole=\"button\" props. Example:\n\n// Not accessible:\nconst NotAccessibleButton = () => (\n  <RectButton onPress={this._onPress}>\n    <Text>Foo</Text>\n  </RectButton>\n);\n// Accessible:\nconst AccessibleButton = () => (\n  <RectButton onPress={this._onPress}>\n    <View accessible accessibilityRole=\"button\">\n      <Text>Bar</Text>\n    </View>\n  </RectButton>\n);\n\n\nIt is applicable for both iOS and Android platform. On iOS, you won't be able to even select the button, on Android you won't be able to click it in accessibility mode.\n\nBaseButton�\n\nCan be used as a base class if you'd like to implement some custom interaction for when the button is pressed.\n\nBelow is a list of properties specific to BaseButton component:\n\nonActiveStateChange�\n\nfunction that gets triggered when button changes from inactive to active and vice versa. It passes active state as a boolean variable as a first parameter for that method.\n\nonPress�\n\nfunction that gets triggered when the button gets pressed (analogous to onPress in TouchableHighlight from RN core).\n\nonLongPress�\n\nfunction that gets triggered when the button gets pressed for at least delayLongPress milliseconds.\n\nrippleColor (Android only)�\n\ndefines color of native ripple animation used since API level 21.\n\nexclusive�\n\ndefines if more than one button could be pressed simultaneously. By default set true.\n\ndelayLongPress�\n\ndefines the delay, in milliseconds, after which the onLongPress callback gets called. By default set to 600.\n\nRectButton�\n\nThis type of button component should be used when you deal with rectangular elements or blocks of content that can be pressed, for example table rows or buttons with text and icons. This component provides a platform specific interaction, rendering a rectangular ripple on Android or highlighting the background on iOS and on older versions of Android. In addition to the props of BaseButton, it accepts the following:\n\nBelow is a list of properties specific to RectButton component:\n\nunderlayColor�\n\nthis is the background color that will be dimmed when button is in active state.\n\nactiveOpacity (iOS only)�\n\nopacity applied to the underlay when button is in active state.\n\nBorderlessButton�\n\nThis type of button component should be used with simple icon-only or text-only buttons. The interaction will be different depending on platform: on Android a borderless ripple will be rendered (it means that the ripple will animate into a circle that can span outside of the view bounds), whereas on iOS the button will be dimmed (similar to how TouchableOpacity works). In addition to the props of BaseButton, it accepts the following:\n\nBelow is a list of properties specific to BorderlessButton component:\n\nborderless (Android only)�\n\nset this to false if you want the ripple animation to render only within view bounds.\n\nactiveOpacity (iOS only)�\n\nopacity applied to the button when it is in an active state.\n\nDesign patterns�\n\nComponents listed here were not designed to behave and look in the same way on both platforms but rather to be used for handling similar behaviour on iOS and Android taking into consideration their's design concepts.\n\nIf you wish to get specific information about platforms design patterns, visit official Apple docs and Material.io guideline, which widely describe how to implement coherent design.\n\nThis library allows to use native components with native feedback in adequate situations.\n\nIf you do not wish to implement custom design approach, RectButton and BorderlessButton seem to be absolutely enough and there's no need to use anything else. In all the remaining cases you can always rely on BaseButton which is a superclass for the other button classes and can be used as a generic Touchable replacement that can be customized to your needs.\n\nBelow we list some of the common usecases for button components to be used along with the type of button that should be used according to the platform specific design guidelines.\n\nLists and action buttons�\n\nIf you have a list with clickable items or have an action button that need to display as a separate UI block (vs being inlined in a text) you should use RectButton. It changes opacity on click and additionally supports a ripple effect on Android.\n\nTo determine emphasis of button it's vital to use fill color or leave it transparent especially on Android. For medium emphasis you may consider outlined buttons which are used for lower impact than fill buttons.\n\nIcon or text only buttons�\n\nUse BorderlessButton for simple icon-only or text-only buttons. The interaction will be different depending on platform: on Android a borderless ripple will be rendered, whereas on iOS the button will be dimmed. It should be used if you wish to handle non-crucial actions and supportive behaviour.\n\nPureNativeButton�\n\nUse a PureNativeButton for accessing the native Component used for build more complex buttons listed above. It's normally is not recommended to use, but it might be useful if we want to wrap it using Animated or Reanimated.\n\nimport {\n  createNativeWrapper,\n  PureNativeButton,\n} from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\nconst { event, Value, createAnimatedComponent } = Animated;\n\nconst AnimatedRawButton = createNativeWrapper(\n  createAnimatedComponent(PureNativeButton),\n  {\n    shouldCancelWhenOutside: false,\n    shouldActivateOnStart: false,\n  }\n);\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    const state = new Value();\n    this._onGestureEvent = event([\n      {\n        nativeEvent: { state },\n      },\n    ]);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <AnimatedRawButton onHandlerStateChange={this._onGestureEvent} />;\n  }\n}\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nComponents\nNEXT\nDrawerLayout\nBaseButton\nonActiveStateChange\nonPress\nonLongPress\nrippleColor (Android only)\nexclusive\ndelayLongPress\nRectButton\nunderlayColor\nactiveOpacity (iOS only)\nBorderlessButton\nborderless (Android only)\nactiveOpacity (iOS only)\nDesign patterns\nLists and action buttons\nIcon or text only buttons\nPureNativeButton\n\nPreview React Native components in isolation.\n\nTry Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

It renders its children within a panable container allows for horizontal swiping left and right. While swiping one of two \"action\" containers can be shown depends on whether user swipes left or right (containers can be rendered by renderLeftActions or renderRightActions props).\n\nUsage:�\n\nTo use it, import it in the following way:\n\nimport Swipeable from 'react-native-gesture-handler/ReanimatedSwipeable';\n\nProperties�\nfriction�\n\na number that specifies how much the visual interaction will be delayed compared to the gesture distance. e.g. value of 1 will indicate that the swipeable panel should exactly follow the gesture, 2 means it is going to be two times \"slower\".\n\nleftThreshold�\n\ndistance from the left edge at which released panel will animate to the open state (or the open panel will animate into the closed state). By default it's a half of the panel's width.\n\nrightThreshold�\n\ndistance from the right edge at which released panel will animate to the open state (or the open panel will animate into the closed state). By default it's a half of the panel's width.\n\ndragOffsetFromLeftEdge�\n\ndistance that the panel must be dragged from the left edge to be considered a swipe. The default value is 10.\n\ndragOffsetFromRightEdge�\n\ndistance that the panel must be dragged from the right edge to be considered a swipe. The default value is 10.\n\novershootLeft�\n\na boolean value indicating if the swipeable panel can be pulled further than the left actions panel's width. It is set to true by default as long as the left panel render function is present.\n\novershootRight�\n\na boolean value indicating if the swipeable panel can be pulled further than the right actions panel's width. It is set to true by default as long as the right panel render function is present.\n\novershootFriction�\n\na number that specifies how much the visual interaction will be delayed compared to the gesture distance at overshoot. Default value is 1, it mean no friction, for a native feel, try 8 or above.\n\nonSwipeableOpen�\n\na function that is called when swipeable is opened (either right or left). Receives swipe direction as an argument.\n\nonSwipeableClose�\n\na function that is called when swipeable is closed. Receives swipe direction as an argument.\n\nonSwipeableWillOpen�\n\na function that is called when swipeable starts animating on open (either right or left). Receives swipe direction as an argument.\n\nonSwipeableWillClose�\n\na function that is called when swipeable starts animating on close. Receives swipe direction as an argument.\n\nonSwipeableOpenStartDrag�\n\na function that is called when a user starts to drag the swipable to open. Receives swipe direction as an argument.\n\nonSwipeableCloseStartDrag�\n\na function that is called when a user starts to drag the swipable to close. Receives swipe direction as an argument.\n\nrenderLeftActions�\n\na function that returns a component which will be rendered under the swipeable after swiping it to the right. The function receives the following arguments:\n\nprogress - a SharedValue representing swiping progress relative to the width of the returned element.\nEquals 0 when swipeable is closed, 1 when swipeable is opened.\nWhen the element overshoots it's opened position the value tends towards Infinity.\ntranslation - a horizontal offset of the swipeable relative to its closed position.\nswipeableMethods - provides an object exposing the methods listed here.\n\nThis function must return a ReactNode.\n\nTo support rtl flexbox layouts use flexDirection styling.\n\nrenderRightActions�\n\na function that returns a component which will be rendered under the swipeable after swiping it to the left. The function receives the following arguments:\n\nprogress - a SharedValue representing swiping progress relative to the width of the returned element.\nEquals 0 when swipeable is closed, 1 when swipeable is opened.\nWhen the element overshoots it's opened position the value tends towards Infinity.\ntranslation - a horizontal offset of the swipeable relative to its closed position.\nswipeableMethods - provides an object exposing the methods listed here.\n\nThis function must return a ReactNode.\n\nTo support rtl flexbox layouts use flexDirection styling.\n\ncontainerStyle�\n\nstyle object for the container (Animated.View), for example to override overflow: 'hidden'.\n\nchildrenContainerStyle�\n\nstyle object for the children container (Animated.View), for example to apply flex: 1.\n\nsimultaneousWithExternalGesture�\n\nA gesture configuration to be recognized simultaneously with the swipeable gesture. This is useful for allowing other gestures to work simultaneously with swipeable gesture handler.\n\nFor example, to enable a pan gesture alongside the swipeable gesture:\n\nconst panGesture = Gesture.Pan();\n\n<GestureDetector gesture={panGesture}>\n  <ReanimatedSwipeable simultaneousWithExternalGesture={panGesture} />\n</GestureDetector>\n\n\nMore details can be found in the gesture composition documentation.\n\nenableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture (iOS only)�\n\nEnables two-finger gestures on supported devices, for example iPads with trackpads. If not enabled the gesture will require click + drag, with enableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture swiping with two fingers will also trigger the gesture.\n\nmouseButton(value: MouseButton) (Web & Android only)�\n\nAllows users to choose which mouse button should handler respond to.

Use Pressable instead.\n\nGesture Handler library provides an implementation of RN's touchable components that are based on native buttons and does not rely on JS responder system utilized by RN. Our touchable implementation follows the same API and aims to be a drop-in replacement for touchables available in React Native.\n\nReact Native's touchables API can be found here:\n\nTouchable Native Feedback\nTouchable Highlight\nTouchable Opacity\nTouchable Without Feedback\n\nAll major touchable properties (except from pressRetentionOffset) have been adopted and should behave in a similar way as with RN's touchables.\n\nThe motivation for using RNGH touchables as a replacement for these imported from React Native is to follow built-in native behavior more closely by utilizing platform native touch system instead of relying on the JS responder system. These touchables and their feedback behavior are deeply integrated with native gesture ecosystem and could be connected with other native components (e.g. ScrollView) and Gesture Handlers easily and in a more predictable way, which follows native apps' behavior.\n\nOur intention was to make switch for these touchables as simple as possible. In order to use RNGH's touchables the only thing you need to do is to change library from which you import touchable components. need only to change imports of touchables.\n\nINFO\n\nGesture Handler's TouchableOpacity uses native driver for animations by default. If this causes problems for you, you can set useNativeAnimations prop to false.\n\nExample:�\nimport {\n  TouchableNativeFeedback,\n  TouchableHighlight,\n  TouchableOpacity,\n  TouchableWithoutFeedback,\n} from 'react-native';\n\n\nhas to be replaced with:\n\nimport {\n  TouchableNativeFeedback,\n  TouchableHighlight,\n  TouchableOpacity,\n  TouchableWithoutFeedback,\n} from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\n\nFor a comparison of both touchable implementations see our touchables example\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nSwipeable\nNEXT\nUnder the hood\nExample:\n\nPreview React Native components in isolation.\n\nTry Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

It renders its children within a panable container allows for horizontal swiping left and right. While swiping one of two \"action\" containers can be shown depends on whether user swipes left or right (containers can be rendered by renderLeftActions or renderRightActions props).\n\nUsage:�\n\nSimilarly to the DrawerLayout, Swipeable component isn't exported by default from the react-native-gesture-handler package. To use it, import it in the following way:\n\nimport Swipeable from 'react-native-gesture-handler/Swipeable';\n\nProperties�\nfriction�\n\nA number that specifies how much the visual interaction will be delayed compared to the gesture distance. e.g. value of 1 will indicate that the swipeable panel should exactly follow the gesture, 2 means it is going to be two times \"slower\".\n\nleftThreshold�\n\nDistance from the left edge at which released panel will animate to the open state (or the open panel will animate into the closed state). By default it's a half of the panel's width.\n\nrightThreshold�\n\nDistance from the right edge at which released panel will animate to the open state (or the open panel will animate into the closed state). By default it's a half of the panel's width.\n\ndragOffsetFromLeftEdge�\n\nDistance that the panel must be dragged from the left edge to be considered a swipe. The default value is 10.\n\ndragOffsetFromRightEdge�\n\nDistance that the panel must be dragged from the right edge to be considered a swipe. The default value is 10.\n\novershootLeft�\n\nA boolean value indicating if the swipeable panel can be pulled further than the left actions panel's width. It is set to true by default as long as the left panel render method is present.\n\novershootRight�\n\nA boolean value indicating if the swipeable panel can be pulled further than the right actions panel's width. It is set to true by default as long as the right panel render method is present.\n\novershootFriction�\n\nA number that specifies how much the visual interaction will be delayed compared to the gesture distance at overshoot. Default value is 1, it mean no friction, for a native feel, try 8 or above.\n\nonSwipeableLeftOpen�\nCAUTION\n\nThis callback is deprecated and will be removed in the next version.

These are the units commonly used in React Native ecosystem (e.g. in the layout system). They do not map directly to physical pixels but instead to iOS's points and to dp units on Android.\n\niOS�\n\nAll gestures are implemented using UIGestureRecognizers, some of them have been slightly modified to allow for more customization and to conform to the state flow of RNGH. When you assign a gesture configuration to the GestureDetector, it creates all the required recognizers and assigns them to the child view of the detector. From this point most of the heavy lifting is handled by the UIKit (with our help to correctly implement interactions between gestures).\n\nAndroid�\n\nUnfortunately, Android doesn't provide an easy way of handling gestures hence most of them were implemented from scratch, including a system for managing how the gestures should interact with each other. Here's a quick overview of how it works: When you wrap a component with GestureHandlerRootView it allows for the RNGH to intercept all touch events on that component and process them, deciding whether they should be handled by one of the gesture handlers or passed to the underlying view. Gesture handlers are created when you assign a gesture configuration to the GestureDetector, it initializes all of the necessary handlers natively. Every GestureHandlerRootView also has a specific handler to decide whether to pass the touch events or to consume them. It can never activate, only begin, end or be cancelled. When this handler is in the UNDETERMINED state it means that there is no touch in progress, however when the touch starts it transitions to the BEGAN state. As long as it stays in that state, no touch event is consumed, but as soon as it gets cancelled (meaning that some handler has activated) all incoming touch events get consumed, preventing underlying view from receiving them.\n\nWhen a pointer touches the screen the view tree is traversed in order to extract all handlers attached to the views below the finger (including the one attached to the GestureHandlerRootView) and all extracted handlers transition to the BEGAN state, signalling that the gesture may have began. The touch events continue to be delivered to all extracted handlers until one of them recognizes the gesture and tries to activate. At this point the orchestrator checks whether this gesture should wait for any other of the extracted gestures to fail. If it does, it's put to the waiting list, if it doesn't, it gets activated and all other gestures (that are not simultaneous with it) get cancelled. When a gesture handlers transitions to a finished state (the gesture recognized by it stops, it fails or gets cancelled) the orchestrator check the waiting handlers. Every one of them that waited for the gesture that just failed tries to activate again (and again the orchestrator checks if it should wait for any of the extracted gestures...).\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nUnder the hood\nNEXT\nHandler State\nUnits\niOS\nAndroid\n\nSet breakpoints and debug React Native apps with ease.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

At any given time, each handler instance has an assigned state that can change when new touch events occur or can be forced to change by the touch system in certain circumstances.\n\nA gesture handler can be in one of the six possible states:\n\nAccessing state\nState flows\nStates\nUNDETERMINED\nFAILED\nBEGAN\nCANCELLED\nACTIVE\nEND\n\nEach state has its own description below.\n\nAccessing state�\n\nWe can monitor a handler's state changes by using the onHandlerStateChange callback and the destructured nativeEvent argument passed to it. This can be done by comparing the nativeEvent's state attribute to one of the constants exported under the State object (see example below).\n\nimport { State, LongPressGestureHandler } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nclass Demo extends Component {\n  _handleStateChange = ({ nativeEvent }) => {\n    if (nativeEvent.state === State.ACTIVE) {\n      Alert.alert('Longpress');\n    }\n  };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <LongPressGestureHandler onHandlerStateChange={this._handleStateChange}>\n        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Longpress me</Text>\n      </LongPressGestureHandler>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nState flows�\n\nThe most typical flow of state is when a gesture handler picks up on an initial touch event then recognizes it then acknowledges its ending then resets itself back to the initial state.\n\nThe flow looks as follows (longer arrows represent that there are possibly more touch events received before the state changes):\n\nUNDETERMINED -> BEGAN ------> ACTIVE ------> END -> UNDETERMINED\n\nAnother possible flow is when a handler receives touches that cause a recognition failure:\n\nUNDETERMINED -> BEGAN ------> FAILED -> UNDETERMINED\n\nAt last, when a handler does properly recognize the gesture but then is interrupted by the touch system. In that case, the gesture recognition is canceled and the flow looks as follows:\n\nUNDETERMINED -> BEGAN ------> ACTIVE ------> CANCELLED -> UNDETERMINED\n\nStates�\n\nThe section below describes all possible handler states:\n\nUNDETERMINED�\n\nThis is the initial state of each handler and it goes into this state after it's done recognizing a gesture.\n\nFAILED�\n\nA handler received some touches but for some reason didn't recognize them. For example, if a finger travels more distance than a defined maxDist property allows, then the handler won't become active but will fail instead. Afterwards, it's state will be reset to UNDETERMINED.\n\nBEGAN�\n\nHandler has started receiving touch stream but hasn't yet received enough data to either fail or activate.\n\nCANCELLED�\n\nThe gesture recognizer has received a signal (possibly new touches or a command from the touch system controller) resulting in the cancellation of a continuous gesture. The gesture's state will become CANCELLED until it is finally reset to the initial state, UNDETERMINED.\n\nACTIVE�\n\nHandler has recognized a gesture. It will become and stay in the ACTIVE state until the gesture finishes (e.g. when user lifts the finger) or gets cancelled by the touch system. Under normal circumstances the state will then turn into END. In the case that a gesture is cancelled by the touch system, its state would then become CANCELLED. Learn about discrete and continuous handlers here to understand how long a handler can be kept in the ACTIVE state.\n\nEND�\n\nThe gesture recognizer has received touches signalling the end of a gesture. Its state will become END until it is reset to UNDETERMINED.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nHow does it work?\nNEXT\nGesture handlers (legacy)\nAccessing state\nState flows\nStates\nUNDETERMINED\nFAILED\nBEGAN\nCANCELLED\nACTIVE\nEND\n\nStreamline your React Native & Expo development.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Please migrate to gestures API instead. Check out our upgrading guide for more information.\n\nThis page covers the common set of properties all gesture handler components expose.\n\nUnits�\n\nAll handler component properties and event attributes that represent onscreen dimensions are expressed in screen density independent units we refer to as \"points\". These are the units commonly used in React Native ecosystem (e.g. in the layout system). They do not map directly to physical pixels but instead to iOS's points and to dp units on Android.\n\nProperties�\n\nThis section describes properties that can be used with all gesture handler components:\n\nenabled�\n\nAccepts a boolean value. Indicates whether the given handler should be analyzing stream of touch events or not. When set to false we can be sure that the handler's state will never become ACTIVE. If the value gets updated while the handler already started recognizing a gesture, then the handler's state it will immediately change to FAILED or CANCELLED (depending on its current state). Default value is true.\n\nshouldCancelWhenOutside�\n\nAccepts a boolean value. When true the handler will cancel or fail recognition (depending on its current state) whenever the finger leaves the area of the connected view. Default value of this property is different depending on the handler type. Most handlers' shouldCancelWhenOutside property defaults to false except for the LongPressGestureHandler and TapGestureHandler which default to true.\n\ncancelsTouchesInView (iOS only)�\n\nAccepts a boolean value. When true, the handler will cancel touches for native UI components (UIButton, UISwitch, etc) it's attached to when it becomes ACTIVE. Default value is true.\n\nsimultaneousHandlers�\n\nAccepts a react ref object or an array of refs to other handler components (refs should be created using React.createRef()). When set, the handler will be allowed to activate even if one or more of the handlers provided by their refs are in an ACTIVE state. It will also prevent the provided handlers from cancelling the current handler when they activate. Read more in the cross handler interaction section.\n\nwaitFor�\n\nAccepts a react ref object or an array of refs to other handler components (refs should be created using React.createRef()). When set the handler will not activate as long as the handlers provided by their refs are in the BEGAN state. Read more in the cross handler interaction section.\n\nhitSlop�\n\nThis parameter enables control over what part of the connected view area can be used to begin recognizing the gesture. When a negative number is provided the bounds of the view will reduce the area by the given number of points in each of the sides evenly.\n\nInstead you can pass an object to specify how each boundary side should be reduced by providing different number of points for left, right, top or bottom sides. You can alternatively provide horizontal or vertical instead of specifying directly left, right or top and bottom. Finally, the object can also take width and height attributes. When width is set it is only allow to specify one of the sides right or left. Similarly when height is provided only top or bottom can be set. Specifying width or height is useful if we only want the gesture to activate on the edge of the view. In which case for example we can set left: 0 and width: 20 which would make it possible for the gesture to be recognize when started no more than 20 points from the left edge.\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that this parameter is primarily designed to reduce the area where gesture can activate. Hence it is only supported for all the values (except width and height) to be non positive (0 or lower). Although on Android it is supported for the values to also be positive and therefore allow to expand beyond view bounds but not further than the parent view bounds. To achieve this effect on both platforms you can use React Native's View hitSlop property.\n\nuserSelect (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which userSelect property should be applied to underlying view. Possible values are \"none\" | \"auto\" | \"text\". Default value is set to \"none\".\n\nactiveCursor (Web only)�\n\nThis parameter allows to specify which cursor should be used when gesture activates. Supports all CSS cursor values (e.g. \"grab\", \"zoom-in\"). Default value is set to \"auto\".\n\nonGestureEvent�\n\nTakes a callback that is going to be triggered for each subsequent touch event while the handler is in an ACTIVE state. Event payload depends on the particular handler type. Common set of event data attributes is documented below and handler specific attributes are documented on the corresponding handler pages. E.g. event payload for PinchGestureHandler contains scale attribute that represents how the distance between fingers changed since when the gesture started.\n\nInstead of a callback Animated.event object can be used. Also Animated events with useNativeDriver flag enabled are fully supported.\n\nonHandlerStateChange�\n\nTakes a callback that is going to be triggered when state of the given handler changes.\n\nThe event payload contains the same payload as in case of onGestureEvent including handler specific event attributes some handlers may provide.\n\nIn addition onHandlerStateChange event payload contains oldState attribute which represents the state of the handler right before the change.\n\nInstead of a callback Animated.event object can be used. Also Animated events with useNativeDriver flag enabled are fully supported.\n\nEvent data�\n\nThis section describes the attributes of event object being provided to onGestureEvent and onHandlerStateChange callbacks:\n\nstate�\n\nCurrent state of the handler. Expressed as one of the constants exported under State object by the library. Refer to the section about handler state to learn more about how to use it.\n\nnumberOfPointers�\n\nRepresents the number of pointers (fingers) currently placed on the screen.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nCross handler interactions\nNEXT\nPan\nUnits\nProperties\nenabled\nshouldCancelWhenOutside\ncancelsTouchesInView (iOS only)\nsimultaneousHandlers\nwaitFor\nhitSlop\nuserSelect (Web only)\nactiveCursor (Web only)\nonGestureEvent\nonHandlerStateChange\nEvent data\nstate\nnumberOfPointers\n\nCatch runtime errors right in your editor.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Please migrate to gestures API instead. Check out our upgrading guide for more information.\n\nGesture handlers can \"communicate\" with each other to support complex gestures and control how they activate in certain scenarios.\n\nThere are two means of achieving that described in the sections below. In each case, it is necessary to provide a reference of one handler as a property to the other. Gesture handler relies on ref objects created using React.createRef() and introduced in React 16.3.\n\nSimultaneous recognition�\n\nBy default, only one gesture handler is allowed to be in the ACTIVE state. So when a gesture handler recognizes a gesture it cancels all other handlers in the BEGAN state and prevents any new handlers from receiving a stream of touch events as long as it remains ACTIVE.\n\nThis behavior can be altered using the simultaneousHandlers property (available for all types of handlers). This property accepts a ref or an array of refs to other handlers. Handlers connected in this way will be allowed to remain in the ACTIVE state at the same time.\n\nUse cases�\n\nSimultaneous recognition needs to be used when implementing a photo preview component that supports zooming (scaling) the photo, rotating and panning it while zoomed in. In this case we would use a PinchGestureHandler, RotationGestureHandler and PanGestureHandler that would have to simultaneously recognize gestures.\n\nExample�\n\nSee the \"Scale, rotate & tilt\" example from the GestureHandler Example App or view it directly on your phone by visiting our expo demo.\n\nclass PinchableBox extends React.Component {\n  // ...take a look on full implementation in an Example app\n  render() {\n    const imagePinch = React.createRef();\n    const imageRotation = React.createRef();\n    return (\n      <RotationGestureHandler\n        ref={imageRotation}\n        simultaneousHandlers={imagePinch}\n        onGestureEvent={this._onRotateGestureEvent}\n        onHandlerStateChange={this._onRotateHandlerStateChange}>\n        <Animated.View>\n          <PinchGestureHandler\n            ref={imagePinch}\n            simultaneousHandlers={imageRotation}\n            onGestureEvent={this._onPinchGestureEvent}\n            onHandlerStateChange={this._onPinchHandlerStateChange}>\n            <Animated.View style={styles.container} collapsable={false}>\n              <Animated.Image\n                style={[\n                  styles.pinchableImage,\n                  {\n                    /* events-related transformations */\n                  },\n                ]}\n              />\n            </Animated.View>\n          </PinchGestureHandler>\n        </Animated.View>\n      </RotationGestureHandler>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAwaiting other handlers�\nUse cases�\n\nA good example where awaiting is necessary is when we want to have single and double tap handlers registered for one view (a button). In such a case we need to make single tap handler await a double tap. Otherwise if we try to perform a double tap the single tap handler will fire just after we hit the button for the first time, consequently cancelling the double tap handler.\n\nExample�\n\nSee the \"Multitap\" example from GestureHandler Example App or view it directly on your phone by visiting our expo demo.\n\nconst doubleTap = React.createRef();\nconst PressBox = () => (\n  <TapGestureHandler\n    onHandlerStateChange={({ nativeEvent }) =>\n      nativeEvent.state === State.ACTIVE && Alert.alert('Single tap!')\n    }\n    waitFor={doubleTap}>\n    <TapGestureHandler\n      ref={doubleTap}\n      onHandlerStateChange={({ nativeEvent }) =>\n        nativeEvent.state === State.ACTIVE && Alert.alert(\"You're so fast\")\n      }\n      numberOfTaps={2}>\n      <View style={styles.box} />\n    </TapGestureHandler>\n  </TapGestureHandler>\n);\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nAbout Gesture Handlers\nNEXT\nCommon handler properties\nSimultaneous recognition\nUse cases\nExample\nAwaiting other handlers\nUse cases\nExample\n\nAn all-in-one IDE for Expo & React Native.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Please migrate to gestures API instead. Check out our upgrading guide for more information.\n\nGesture handlers are the core building blocks of this library. We use this term to describe elements of the native touch system that the library allows us to instantiate and control from Javascript using React's Component interface.\n\nEach handler type is capable of recognizing one type of gesture (pan, pinch, etc.) and provides gesture-specific information via events (translation, scale, etc.).\n\nHandlers analyze touch stream synchronously in the UI thread. This allows for uninterrupted interactions even when the Javascript thread is blocked.\n\nEach handler works as an isolated state machine. It takes touch stream as an input and based on it, it can flip between states. When a gesture starts, based on the position where the finger was placed, a set of handlers that may be interested in recognizing the gesture is selected. All the touch events (touch down, move, up, or when other fingers are placed or lifted) are delivered to all of the handlers selected initially. When one gesture becomes active, it cancels all the other gestures (read more about how to influence this process in \"Cross handler interactions\" section).\n\nGesture handler components do not instantiate a native view in the view hierarchy. Instead, they are kept in library's own registry and are only connected to native views. When using any of the gesture handler components, it is important for it to have a native view rendered as a child. Since handler components don't have corresponding views in the hierarchy, the events registered with them are actually hooked into the underlying view.\n\nAvailable gesture handlers�\n\nCurrently, the library provides the following list of gestures. Their parameters and attributes they provide to gesture events are documented under each gesture page:\n\nPanGestureHandler\nTapGestureHandler\nLongPressGestureHandler\nRotationGestureHandler\nFlingGestureHandler\nPinchGestureHandler\nForceTouchGestureHandler\nDiscrete vs continuous�\n\nWe distinguish between two types of gestures: discrete and continuous.\n\nContinuous gesture handlers can be active for a long period of time and will generate a stream of gesture events until the gesture is over. An example of a continuous handler is PanGestureHandler that once activated, will start providing updates about translation and other properties.\n\nOn the other hand, discrete gesture handlers once activated will not stay in the active state but will end immediately. LongPressGestureHandler is a discrete handler, as it only detects if the finger is placed for a sufficiently long period of time, it does not track finger movements (as that's the responsibility of PanGestureHandler).\n\nKeep in mind that onGestureEvent is only generated in continuous gesture handlers and shouldn't be used in the TapGestureHandler and other discrete handlers.\n\nNesting handlers�\n\nHandler components can be nested. In any case it is recommended that the innermost handler renders a native view component. There are some limitations that apply when using useNativeDriver flag. An example of nested handlers:\n\nclass Multitap extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <LongPressGestureHandler\n        onHandlerStateChange={this._onLongpress}\n        minDurationMs={800}>\n        <TapGestureHandler\n          onHandlerStateChange={this._onSingleTap}\n          waitFor={this.doubleTapRef}>\n          <TapGestureHandler\n            ref={this.doubleTapRef}\n            onHandlerStateChange={this._onDoubleTap}\n            numberOfTaps={2}>\n            <View style={styles.box} />\n          </TapGestureHandler>\n        </TapGestureHandler>\n      </LongPressGestureHandler>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nUsing native components�\n\nGesture handler library exposes a set of components normally available in React Native that are wrapped in NativeViewGestureHandler. Here is a list of exposed components:\n\nScrollView\nFlatList\nSwitch\nTextInput\nDrawerLayoutAndroid (Android only)\n\nIf you want to use other handlers or buttons nested in a ScrollView, use the waitFor property to define interaction between a handler and ScrollView\n\nEvents with useNativeDriver�\n\nBecause handlers do not instantiate native views but instead hook up to their child views, directly nesting two gesture handlers using Animated.event is not currently supported. To workaround this limitation we recommend placing an <Animated.View> component in between the handlers.\n\nInstead of doing:\n\nconst PanAndRotate = () => (\n  <PanGestureHandler onGestureEvent={Animated.event({ ... }, { useNativeDriver: true })}>\n    <RotationGestureHandler onGestureEvent={Animated.event({ ... }, { useNativeDriver: true })}>\n      <Animated.View style={animatedStyles}/>\n    </RotationGestureHandler>\n  </PanGestureHandler>\n);\n\n\nPlace an <Animated.View> in between the handlers:\n\nconst PanAndRotate = () => (\n  <PanGestureHandler onGestureEvent={Animated.event({ ... }, { useNativeDriver: true })}>\n    <Animated.View>\n      <RotationGestureHandler onGestureEvent={Animated.event({ ... }, { useNativeDriver: true })}>\n        <Animated.View style={animatedStyles}/>\n      </RotationGestureHandler>\n    </Animated.View>\n  </PanGestureHandler>\n);\n\n\nAnother consequence of handlers depending on their native child components is that when using a useNativeDriver flag with an Animated.event, the child component must be wrapped by an Animated.API e.g. <Animated.View> instead of just a <View>:\n\nclass Draggable extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <PanGestureHandler onGestureEvent={Animated.event({ ... }, { useNativeDriver: true })}>\n        <Animated.View style={animatedStyles} /> {/* <-- NEEDS TO BE Animated.View */}\n      </PanGestureHandler>\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nGesture handlers (legacy)\nNEXT\nCross handler interactions\nAvailable gesture handlers\nDiscrete vs continuous\nNesting handlers\nUsing native components\nEvents with useNativeDriver\n\nStreamline your React Native & Expo development.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Check out our upgrading guide for more information.\n\nA discrete gesture handler that recognizes one or many taps.\n\nTap gestures detect one or more fingers briefly touching the screen. The fingers involved in these gestures must not move significantly from their initial touch positions. The required number of taps and allowed distance from initial position may be configured. For example, you might configure tap gesture recognizers to detect single taps, double taps, or triple taps.\n\nIn order for a handler to activate, specified gesture requirements such as minPointers, numberOfTaps, maxDist, maxDurationMs, and maxDelayMs (explained below) must be met. Immediately after the handler activates, it will END.\n\nProperties�\n\nSee set of properties inherited from base handler class. Below is a list of properties specific to the TapGestureHandler component:\n\nminPointers�\n\nMinimum number of pointers (fingers) required to be placed before the handler activates. Should be a positive integer. The default value is 1.\n\nmaxDurationMs�\n\nMaximum time, expressed in milliseconds, that defines how fast a finger must be released after a touch. The default value is 500.\n\nmaxDelayMs�\n\nMaximum time, expressed in milliseconds, that can pass before the next tap — if many taps are required. The default value is 500.\n\nnumberOfTaps�\n\nNumber of tap gestures required to activate the handler. The default value is 1.\n\nmaxDeltaX�\n\nMaximum distance, expressed in points, that defines how far the finger is allowed to travel along the X axis during a tap gesture. If the finger travels further than the defined distance along the X axis and the handler hasn't yet activated, it will fail to recognize the gesture.\n\nmaxDeltaY�\n\nMaximum distance, expressed in points, that defines how far the finger is allowed to travel along the Y axis during a tap gesture. If the finger travels further than the defined distance along the Y axis and the handler hasn't yet activated, it will fail to recognize the gesture.\n\nmaxDist�\n\nMaximum distance, expressed in points, that defines how far the finger is allowed to travel during a tap gesture. If the finger travels further than the defined distance and the handler hasn't yet activated, it will fail to recognize the gesture.\n\nEvent data�\n\nSee set of event attributes from base handler class. Below is a list of gesture event attributes specific to the TapGestureHandler component:\n\nx�\n\nX coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the handler.\n\ny�\n\nY coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the handler.\n\nabsoluteX�\n\nX coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. It is recommended to use absoluteX instead of x in cases when the view attached to the handler can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nabsoluteY�\n\nY coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. It is recommended to use absoluteY instead of y in cases when the view attached to the handler can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nExample�\n\nSee the multitap example from GestureHandler Example App.\n\nexport class PressBox extends Component {\n  doubleTapRef = React.createRef();\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <TapGestureHandler\n        onHandlerStateChange={this._onSingleTap}\n        waitFor={this.doubleTapRef}>\n        <TapGestureHandler ref={this.doubleTapRef} numberOfTaps={2}>\n          <View style={styles.box} />\n        </TapGestureHandler>\n      </TapGestureHandler>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nPan\nNEXT\nLong press\nProperties\nminPointers\nmaxDurationMs\nmaxDelayMs\nnumberOfTaps\nmaxDeltaX\nmaxDeltaY\nmaxDist\nEvent data\nx\ny\nabsoluteX\nabsoluteY\nExample\n\nRun, preview, and debug your React Native & Expo apps without leaving VSCode.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

This handler's state will turn into END immediately after the finger is released. The handler will fail to recognize a touch event if the finger is lifted before the minimum required time or if the finger is moved further than the allowable distance.\n\nThe handler is implemented using UILongPressGestureRecognizer on iOS and LongPressGestureHandler on Android.\n\nProperties�\n\nSee set of properties inherited from base handler class. Below is a list of properties specific to the LongPressGestureHandler component:\n\nminDurationMs�\n\nMinimum time, expressed in milliseconds, that a finger must remain pressed on the corresponding view. The default value is 500.\n\nmaxDist�\n\nMaximum distance, expressed in points, that defines how far the finger is allowed to travel during a long press gesture. If the finger travels further than the defined distance and the handler hasn't yet activated, it will fail to recognize the gesture. The default value is 10.\n\nEvent data�\n\nSee set of event attributes from base handler class.

Please migrate to gestures API instead. Check out our upgrading guide for more information.\n\nA continuous gesture handler that can recognize a panning (dragging) gesture and track its movement.\n\nThe handler activates when a finger is placed on the screen and moved some initial distance.\n\nConfigurations such as a minimum initial distance, specific vertical or horizontal pan detection and number of fingers required for activation (allowing for multifinger swipes) may be specified.\n\nGesture callback can be used for continuous tracking of the pan gesture. It provides information about the gesture such as its XY translation from the starting point as well as its instantaneous velocity.\n\nThe handler is implemented using UIPanGestureRecognizer on iOS and PanGestureHandler on Android.\n\nCustom activation criteria�\n\nThe PanGestureHandler component exposes a number of properties that can be used to customize the criteria under which a handler will activate or fail when recognizing a gesture.\n\nWhen more than one of such a property is set, PanGestureHandler expects all criteria to be met for successful recognition and at most one of the criteria to be overstepped to fail recognition. For example when both minDeltaX and minDeltaY are set to 20 we expect the finger to travel by 20 points in both the X and Y axis before the handler activates. Another example would be setting both maxDeltaX and maxDeltaY to 20 and minDist to 23. In such a case, if we move a finger along the X-axis by 20 points and along the Y-axis by 0 points, the handler will fail even though the finger is still within the bounds of translation along Y-axis.\n\nMulti touch pan handling�\n\nIf your app relies on multi touch pan handling this section provides some information how the default behavior differs between the platform and how (if necessary) it can be unified.\n\nThe difference in multi touch pan handling lies in the way how translation properties during the event are being calculated. On iOS the default behavior when more than one finger is placed on the screen is to treat this situation as if only one pointer was placed in the center of mass (average position of all the pointers). This applies also to many platform native components that handle touch even if not primarily interested in multi touch interactions like for example UIScrollView component.\n\nThe default behavior for native components like scroll view, pager views or drawers is different and hence gesture handler defaults to that when it comes to pan handling. The difference is that instead of treating the center of mass of all the fingers placed as a leading pointer it takes the latest placed finger as such. This behavior can be changed on Android using avgTouches flag.\n\nNote that on both Android and iOS when the additional finger is placed on the screen that translation prop is not affected even though the position of the pointer being tracked might have changed. Therefore it is safe to rely on translation most of the time as it only reflects the movement that happens regardless of how many fingers are placed on the screen and if that number changes over time. If you wish to track the \"center of mass\" virtual pointer and account for its changes when the number of finger changes you can use relative or absolute position provided in the event (x and y or absoluteX and absoluteY).\n\nProperties�\n\nSee set of properties inherited from base handler class. Below is a list of properties specific to PanGestureHandler component:\n\nminDist�\n\nMinimum distance the finger (or multiple finger) need to travel before the handler activates. Expressed in points.\n\nminPointers�\n\nA number of fingers that is required to be placed before handler can activate. Should be a higher or equal to 0 integer.\n\nmaxPointers�\n\nWhen the given number of fingers is placed on the screen and handler hasn't yet activated it will fail recognizing the gesture. Should be a higher or equal to 0 integer.\n\nactiveOffsetX�\n\nRange along X axis (in points) where fingers travels without activation of handler. Moving outside of this range implies activation of handler. Range can be given as an array or a single number. If range is set as an array, first value must be lower or equal to 0, a the second one higher or equal to 0. If only one number p is given a range of (-inf, p) will be used if p is higher or equal to 0 and (-p, inf) otherwise.\n\nactiveOffsetY�\n\nRange along Y axis (in points) where fingers travels without activation of handler. Moving outside of this range implies activation of handler. Range can be given as an array or a single number. If range is set as an array, first value must be lower or equal to 0, a the second one higher or equal to 0. If only one number p is given a range of (-inf, p) will be used if p is higher or equal to 0 and (-p, inf) otherwise.\n\nfailOffsetY�\n\nWhen the finger moves outside this range (in points) along Y axis and handler hasn't yet activated it will fail recognizing the gesture. Range can be given as an array or a single number. If range is set as an array, first value must be lower or equal to 0, a the second one higher or equal to 0. If only one number p is given a range of (-inf, p) will be used if p is higher or equal to 0 and (-p, inf) otherwise.\n\nfailOffsetX�\n\nWhen the finger moves outside this range (in points) along X axis and handler hasn't yet activated it will fail recognizing the gesture. Range can be given as an array or a single number. If range is set as an array, first value must be lower or equal to 0, a the second one higher or equal to 0. If only one number p is given a range of (-inf, p) will be used if p is higher or equal to 0 and (-p, inf) otherwise.\n\nmaxDeltaX�\n\nThis method is deprecated but supported for backward compatibility. Instead of using maxDeltaX={N} you can do failOffsetX={[-N, N]}.\n\nWhen the finger travels the given distance expressed in points along X axis and handler hasn't yet activated it will fail recognizing the gesture.\n\nmaxDeltaY�\n\nThis method is deprecated but supported for backward compatibility. Instead of using maxDeltaY={N} you can do failOffsetY={[-N, N]}.\n\nWhen the finger travels the given distance expressed in points along Y axis and handler hasn't yet activated it will fail recognizing the gesture.\n\nminOffsetX�\n\nThis method is deprecated but supported for backward compatibility. Instead of using minOffsetX={N} you can do activeOffsetX={N}.\n\nMinimum distance along X (in points) axis the finger (or multiple finger) need to travel before the handler activates. If set to a lower or equal to 0 value we expect the finger to travel \"left\" by the given distance. When set to a higher or equal to 0 number the handler will activate on a movement to the \"right\". If you wish for the movement direction to be ignored use minDeltaX instead.\n\nminOffsetY�\n\nThis method is deprecated but supported for backward compatibility. Instead of using minOffsetY={N} you can do activeOffsetY={N}.\n\nMinimum distance along Y (in points) axis the finger (or multiple finger) need to travel before the handler activates. If set to a lower or equal to 0 value we expect the finger to travel \"up\" by the given distance. When set to a higher or equal to 0 number the handler will activate on a movement to the \"bottom\". If you wish for the movement direction to be ignored use minDeltaY instead.\n\nminDeltaX�\n\nThis method is deprecated but supported for backward compatibility. Instead of using minDeltaX={N} you can do activeOffsetX={[-N, N]}.\n\nMinimum distance along X (in points) axis the finger (or multiple finger) need to travel (left or right) before the handler activates. Unlike minoffsetx this parameter accepts only non-lower or equal to 0 numbers that represents the distance in point units. If you want for the handler to activate for the movement in one particular direction use minOffsetX instead.\n\nminDeltaY�\n\nThis method is deprecated but supported for backward compatibility. Instead of using minDeltaY={N} you can do activeOffsetY={[-N, N]}.\n\nMinimum distance along Y (in points) axis the finger (or multiple finger) need to travel (top or bottom) before the handler activates. Unlike minOffsetY this parameter accepts only non-lower or equal to 0 numbers that represents the distance in point units. If you want for the handler to activate for the movement in one particular direction use minOffsetY instead.\n\navgTouches (Android only)�\n\nAndroid, by default, will calculate translation values based on the position of the leading pointer (the first one that was placed on the screen). This prop allows that behavior to be changed to the one that is default on iOS - the averaged position of all active pointers will be used to calculate the translation values.\n\nenableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture (iOS only)�\n\nEnables two-finger gestures on supported devices, for example iPads with trackpads. If not enabled the gesture will require click + drag, with enableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture swiping with two fingers will also trigger the gesture.\n\nEvent data�\n\nSee set of event attributes from base handler class. Below is a list of gesture event attributes specific to PanGestureHandler:\n\ntranslationX�\n\nTranslation of the pan gesture along X axis accumulated over the time of the gesture. The value is expressed in the point units.\n\ntranslationY�\n\nTranslation of the pan gesture along Y axis accumulated over the time of the gesture. The value is expressed in the point units.\n\nvelocityX�\n\nVelocity of the pan gesture along the X axis in the current moment. The value is expressed in point units per second.\n\nvelocityY�\n\nVelocity of the pan gesture along the Y axis in the current moment. The value is expressed in point units per second.\n\nx�\n\nX coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the handler. Expressed in point units.\n\ny�\n\nY coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the handler. Expressed in point units.\n\nabsoluteX�\n\nX coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of x in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nabsoluteY�\n\nY coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of y in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nExample�\n\nSee the draggable example from Gesture Handler Example App.\n\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Animated, Dimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport {\n  GestureHandlerRootView,\n  PanGestureHandler,\n} from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nconst { width } = Dimensions.get('screen');\nconst circleRadius = 30;\n\nclass Circle extends Component {\n  _touchX = new Animated.Value(width / 2 - circleRadius);\n\n  _onPanGestureEvent = Animated.event([{ nativeEvent: { x: this._touchX } }], {\n    useNativeDriver: true,\n  });\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <GestureHandlerRootView>\n        <PanGestureHandler onGestureEvent={this._onPanGestureEvent}>\n          <Animated.View\n            style={{\n              height: 150,\n              justifyContent: 'center',\n            }}>\n            <Animated.View\n              style={[\n                {\n                  backgroundColor: '#42a5f5',\n                  borderRadius: circleRadius,\n                  height: circleRadius * 2,\n                  width: circleRadius * 2,\n                },\n                {\n                  transform: [\n                    {\n                      translateX: Animated.add(\n                        this._touchX,\n                        new Animated.Value(-circleRadius)\n                      ),\n                    },\n                  ],\n                },\n              ]}\n            />\n          </Animated.View>\n        </PanGestureHandler>\n      </GestureHandlerRootView>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <Circle />;\n}\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nCommon handler properties\nNEXT\nTap\nCustom activation criteria\nMulti touch pan handling\nProperties\nminDist\nminPointers\nmaxPointers\nactiveOffsetX\nactiveOffsetY\nfailOffsetY\nfailOffsetX\nmaxDeltaX\nmaxDeltaY\nminOffsetX\nminOffsetY\nminDeltaX\nminDeltaY\navgTouches (Android only)\nenableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture (iOS only)\nEvent data\ntranslationX\ntranslationY\nvelocityX\nvelocityY\nx\ny\nabsoluteX\nabsoluteY\nExample\n\nCatch runtime errors right in your editor.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

It allows for tracking the distance between two fingers and use that information to scale or zoom your content. The handler activates when fingers are placed on the screen and change their position. Gesture callback can be used for continuous tracking of the pinch gesture. It provides information about velocity, anchor (focal) point of gesture and scale.\n\nThe distance between the fingers is reported as a scale factor. At the beginning of the gesture, the scale factor is 1.0. As the distance between the two fingers increases, the scale factor increases proportionally. Similarly, the scale factor decreases as the distance between the fingers decreases. Pinch gestures are used most commonly to change the size of objects or content onscreen. For example, map views use pinch gestures to change the zoom level of the map.\n\nThe handler is implemented using UIPinchGestureRecognizer on iOS and from scratch on Android.\n\nProperties�\n\nProperties provided to PinchGestureHandler do not extend common set of properties from base handler class.\n\nEvent data�\n\nSee set of event attributes from base handler class.

Handler gets ACTIVE when movement is sufficiently long and it does not take too much time. When handler gets activated it will turn into END state when finger is released. The handler will fail to recognize if the finger is lifted before being activated. The handler is implemented using UISwipeGestureRecognizer on iOS and from scratch on Android.\n\nProperties�\n\nSee set of properties inherited from base handler class. Below is a list of properties specific to FlingGestureHandler component:\n\ndirection�\n\nExpressed allowed direction of movement. It's possible to pass one or many directions in one parameter:\n\ndirection={Directions.RIGHT | Directions.LEFT}\n\n\nor\n\ndirection={Directions.DOWN}\n\nnumberOfPointers�\n\nDetermine exact number of points required to handle the fling gesture.\n\nEvent data�\n\nSee set of event attributes from base handler class. Below is a list of gesture event attributes specific to FlingGestureHandler:\n\nx�\n\nX coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the handler. Expressed in point units.\n\ny�\n\nY coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the handler. Expressed in point units.\n\nabsoluteX�\n\nX coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of x in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nabsoluteY�\n\nY coordinate of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the window. The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of y in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.\n\nExample�\n\nSee the fling example from Gesture Handler Example App.\n\nconst LongPressButton = () => (\n  <FlingGestureHandler\n    direction={Directions.RIGHT | Directions.LEFT}\n    onHandlerStateChange={({ nativeEvent }) => {\n      if (nativeEvent.state === State.ACTIVE) {\n        Alert.alert(\"I'm flinged!\");\n      }\n    }}>\n    <View style={styles.box} />\n  </FlingGestureHandler>\n);\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nRotation\nNEXT\nPinch\nProperties\ndirection\nnumberOfPointers\nEvent data\nx\ny\nabsoluteX\nabsoluteY\nExample\n\nReduce context switching & streamline React Native and Expo development.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

It allows for tracking pressure of touch on some iOS devices. The handler activates when pressure of touch if greater or equal than minForce. It fails if pressure is greater than maxForce Gesture callback can be used for continuous tracking of the touch pressure. It provides information for one finger (the first one).\n\nAt the beginning of the gesture, the pressure factor is 0.0. As the pressure increases, the pressure factor increases proportionally. The maximum pressure is 1.0.\n\nThe handler is implemented using custom UIGestureRecognizer on iOS. There's no implementation provided on Android and it simply render children without any wrappers. Since this behaviour is only provided on some iOS devices, this handler should not be used for defining any crucial behaviors. Use it only as an additional improvement and make all features to be accessed without this handler as well.\n\nProperties\n\nSee set of properties inherited from base handler class. Below is a list of properties specific to ForceTouchGestureHandler component:\n\nminForce�\n\nA minimal pressure that is required before handler can activate. Should be a value from range [0.0, 1.0]. Default is 0.2.\n\nmaxForce�\n\nA maximal pressure that could be applied for handler. If the pressure is greater, handler fails. Should be a value from range [0.0, 1.0].\n\nfeedbackOnActivation�\n\nBoolean value defining if haptic feedback has to be performed on activation.\n\nEvent data�\n\nSee set of event attributes from base handler class. Below is a list of gesture event attributes specific to ForceTouchGestureHandler:\n\nforce�\n\nThe pressure of a touch.\n\nStatic method�\nforceTouchAvailable�\n\nYou may check if it's possible to use ForceTouchGestureHandler with ForceTouchGestureHandler.forceTouchAvailable\n\nExample�\n\nSee the force touch handler example from Gesture Handler Example App.\n\n<ForceTouchGestureHandler\n  minForce={0}\n  onGestureEvent={this._onGestureEvent}\n  onHandlerStateChange={this._onHandlerStateChange}>\n  <Animated.View\n    style={[\n      styles.box,\n      { transform: [{ scale: Animated.add(1, this.force) }] },\n    ]}\n  />\n</ForceTouchGestureHandler>\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nPinch\nNEXT\nNativeView\nminForce\nmaxForce\nfeedbackOnActivation\nEvent data\nforce\nStatic method\nforceTouchAvailable\nExample\n\nRun, preview, and debug apps faster.\n\nTry our IDE for React Native\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

values one\nvalues one\nvalues one for the translation x and one from the\nfor the translation x and one from the\nfor the translation x and one from the translation y\ntranslation y\ntranslation y so i can create x is use\nso i can create x is use\nso i can create x is use shared value\non active\non active we get\nwe get\nwe get the translation\nx and y\nx and y and we can assign it to the x and

configuration\nand for y we always go to zero so we've\nand for y we always go to zero so we've spring to zero and we can use velocity y\ni move the card around\ni move the card around so here the snap point is not correct\nso the weave of the screen\nso the weave of the screen may not the weave of the card\nmay not the weave of the card\nmay not the weave of the card no it's plus the width of the card\nno it's plus the width of the card\nno it's plus the width of the card divided by two\ndivided by two\ndivided by two so here i snap back to the center and if\nso here i snap back to the center and if\nso here i snap back to the center and if i go left\ni go left\ni go left so it's\nso it's\nso it's not the\nnot the\nnot the minus the way of the card but plus the\nminus the way of the card but plus the\nminus the way of the card but plus the width of the card divided by two\nso up back to the middle and let's go to\nso up back to the middle and let's go to the side\nthe side\nthe side perfect\nso here we see the\nso here we see the [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] bouncing appear on the left and right\nbouncing appear on the left and right\nbouncing appear on the left and right so i think we're going to add\nso i think we're going to add\nso i think we're going to add some padding to this maybe 50\nsome padding to this maybe 50\nsome padding to this maybe 50 50 points\n50 points\n50 points let's see\nlet's see\nlet's see um\num\num so that actually\nso that actually\nso that actually looks good now what i would like to do\nlooks good now what i would like to do\nlooks good now what i would like to do is to add the rotation\nis to add the rotation\nis to add the rotation on the x and z axis\non the x and z axis\non the x and z axis and we can\nand we can\nand we can add the\nadd the\nadd the [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] x rotation because it's fixed maybe\nx rotation because it's fixed maybe\nx rotation because it's fixed maybe let's say 30 degrees\nlet's say 30 degrees\nlet's say 30 degrees so rotate z equals\nso rotate z equals\nso rotate z equals 30 degrees\nand you see it looks squished\nand you see it looks squished because we didn't add the perspective\nbecause we didn't add the perspective\nbecause we didn't add the perspective so we can add some perspective value\nso we can add some perspective value\nso we can add some perspective value here you can pick look at whatever feels\nhere you can pick look at whatever feels\nhere you can pick look at whatever feels good to you\ngood to you\ngood to you so this this looks good\nso this this looks good\nso this this looks good and what we can do\nand what we can do\nand what we can do so we're going to add the scale\nso we're going to add the scale\nso we're going to add the scale transform but first maybe let me do the\ntransform but first maybe let me do the\ntransform but first maybe let me do the rotate\nrotate\nrotate z\nz\nz so we're going to add a rotate z value\nand we want a random value between\nand we want a random value between let's say minus 10 degrees or between\nlet's say minus 10 degrees or between\nlet's say minus 10 degrees or between minus 10 to 10 degrees\nminus 10 to 10 degrees\nminus 10 to 10 degrees so we have map random\nso we have map random\nso we have map random that goes from zero to one\nthat goes from zero to one\nthat goes from zero to one so we go we want it to go from zero to\nso we go we want it to go from zero to\nso we go we want it to go from zero to 20\n20\n20 so we multiply by 20 and then we remove\nso we multiply by 20 and then we remove\nso we multiply by 20 and then we remove 10\n10\n10 to go from minus 10 to\nto go from minus 10 to\nto go from minus 10 to 10.\n10.\n10. right we go from 0 to 20 and if we\nright we go from 0 to 20 and if we\nright we go from 0 to 20 and if we remove 10 we go from -10 to\nremove 10 we go from -10 to\nremove 10 we go from -10 to 10\nso rotate z\nso rotate z equals rotate z dot value\nequals rotate z dot value\nequals rotate z dot value and these are degrees\nand these are degrees\nand these are degrees looks good\nlooks good\nlooks good and now one thing we can do is when\nand now one thing we can do is when\nand now one thing we can do is when selecting the card scale\nyeah scale the card have the rotate z go\nyeah scale the card have the rotate z go back to zero\nback to zero\nback to zero so i'm gonna add the scale\nso i'm gonna add the scale\nso i'm gonna add the scale transformation\nyou'll notice that here i'm adding the\nyou'll notice that here i'm adding the scale at the end here the order of um of\nscale at the end here the order of um of\nscale at the end here the order of um of the transformation\nthe transformation\nthe transformation is important i will link to a video on\nis important i will link to a video on\nis important i will link to a video on this topic in the video description\nthis topic in the video description\nthis topic in the video description so we're going to create a scale\nso we're going to create a scale\nso we're going to create a scale value\nso you use shared value\nso you use shared value default value is one\ndefault value is one\ndefault value is one when we start the gesture we can put it\nwhen we start the gesture we can put it\nwhen we start the gesture we can put it to\nand rotate z\nand rotate z goes to\ngoes to\ngoes to zero\nzero\nzero and we probably can add maybe some\nand we probably can add maybe some\nand we probably can add maybe some nice easing\nto give it a physical feel\nto give it a physical feel let me import easing from reanimated\nlet me import easing from reanimated\nlet me import easing from reanimated so here i select the card\nso here i select the card\nso here i select the card the rotate z goes to zero\nthe rotate z goes to zero\nthe rotate z goes to zero we scaled nicely\nwe scaled nicely\nwe scaled nicely i need to scale back when we release the\ni need to scale back when we release the\ni need to scale back when we release the gesture\nso on end\nso on end scale.value\nscale.value\nscale.value goes back to one and i i think i should\ngoes back to one and i i think i should\ngoes back to one and i i think i should always do this\nalways do this\nalways do this easing in the animation configuration\nand one thing we could do is also set\nand one thing we could do is also set the rotate x to zero when we select the\nthe rotate x to zero when we select the\nthe rotate x to zero when we select the card\nso that actually looks pretty good\nso that actually looks pretty good and one thing we can do is to animate\nand one thing we can do is to animate\nand one thing we can do is to animate the cards when they appear for the first\nthe cards when they appear for the first\nthe cards when they appear for the first time\ntime\ntime so the default value here for\nso the default value here for\nso the default value here for translate y is going to be let's say\ntranslate y is going to be let's say\ntranslate y is going to be let's say minus the height\nminus the height\nminus the height of the screen so they disappear\nof the screen so they disappear\nof the screen so they disappear and we can as we can add a use effect\nso when we mount the component we want\nso when we mount the component we want the cards to appear\nso let me add the empty dependencies\nso let me add the empty dependencies so\nso\nso we can add\nwe can add\nwe can add so y dot value\nwe can add the timing animation to zero\nwe can add the timing animation to zero again yeah here i have duration and i\nagain yeah here i have duration and i\nagain yeah here i have duration and i want to use some nice easing\nbut of course we want here they all\nbut of course we want here they all appear at the same time we want some\nappear at the same time we want some\nappear at the same time we want some delay which depends on the index of the\ndelay which depends on the index of the\ndelay which depends on the index of the card\ncard\ncard whichever which we have as a property\nwhichever which we have as a property\nwhichever which we have as a property here\nhere\nhere so i'm going to calculate delay simply\nso i'm going to calculate delay simply\nso i'm going to calculate delay simply index time\nindex time\nindex time duration\nso here we can add weave\nso here we can add weave delay\nso what i like in reality 2 is that\nso what i like in reality 2 is that animations are first-class citizens\nanimations are first-class citizens\nanimations are first-class citizens and they can be nicely composed with\nand they can be nicely composed with\nand they can be nicely composed with each other you can add delays timing and\neach other you can add delays timing and\neach other you can add delays timing and you can really actually go pretty crazy\nyou can really actually go pretty crazy\nyou can really actually go pretty crazy with the level of composibility in the\nwith the level of composibility in the\nwith the level of composibility in the the animation you can add pause bouncing\nthe animation you can add pause bouncing\nthe animation you can add pause bouncing uh you name it\nuh you name it\nuh you name it here i can update the array of\nhere i can update the array of\nhere i can update the array of dependencies even though it will never\ndependencies even though it will never\ndependencies even though it will never change\nchange\nchange and one thing\nand one thing\nand one thing we might want to do let's have a look\nwe might want to do let's have a look\nwe might want to do let's have a look so that's\nso that's\nso that's pretty good but also maybe we want to\npretty good but also maybe we want to\npretty good but also maybe we want to set the rotate in the animation\nset the rotate in the animation\nset the rotate in the animation so i'm going to extract it here\num\num [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] so i can\nmaybe i want to add an offset to the\nmaybe i want to add an offset to the delay maybe one second here you can pick\ndelay maybe one second here you can pick\ndelay maybe one second here you can pick any value you would like let's have a\nany value you would like let's have a\nany value you would like let's have a look\nso i think that looks pretty good\nso i think that looks pretty good and i can swipe the cards\nand i can swipe the cards\nand i can swipe the cards and now when all the cards have\nand now when all the cards have\nand now when all the cards have disappeared i would like maybe to\ndisappeared i would like maybe to\ndisappeared i would like maybe to shuffle\nshuffle\nshuffle them back with a nice animation so here\nthem back with a nice animation so here\nthem back with a nice animation so here shuffling back is a state that is across\nshuffling back is a state that is across\nshuffling back is a state that is across all cards so i need to go to the parent\nall cards so i need to go to the parent\nall cards so i need to go to the parent components so here i have all my cards\ncomponents so here i have all my cards\ncomponents so here i have all my cards and i'm going to create a\nand i'm going to create a\nand i'm going to create a shuffle back animation value which is\nshuffle back animation value which is\nshuffle back animation value which is true when we need to shuffle back the\ntrue when we need to shuffle back the\ntrue when we need to shuffle back the cards\ncards\ncards so\nso\nso shuffle back\nshuffle back\nshuffle back default value is false\ndefault value is false\ndefault value is false and i can pass it as a property of each\nand i can pass it as a property of each\nand i can pass it as a property of each card\nso shuffle back is an animated\nso shuffle back is an animated so it's a shared value\nso it's a shared value\nso it's a shared value of boolean\nand\nand when\nwhen\nwhen the gesture ends\nand actually we can look\nand actually we can look when it ends so it means also when it\nwhen it ends so it means also when it\nwhen it ends so it means also when it ends and the animations are over\nends and the animations are over\nends and the animations are over so i can use the callback and with\nso i can use the callback and with\nso i can use the callback and with timing\ntiming\ntiming to see when the animation is over\nto see when the animation is over\nto see when the animation is over so the problem is because spring has\nso the problem is because spring has\nso the problem is because spring has small oscillations\nsmall oscillations\nsmall oscillations even though it looks like the animation\neven though it looks like the animation\neven though it looks like the animation is finished technically it's not done\nis finished technically it's not done\nis finished technically it's not done so with timing will be faster because\nso with timing will be faster because\nso with timing will be faster because it's\nit's\nit's exactly after the default duration it\nexactly after the default duration it\nexactly after the default duration it will be over\nwill be over\nwill be over so we can look if the card is last so\nso we can look if the card is last so\nso we can look if the card is last so here because we have them on top of each\nhere because we have them on top of each\nhere because we have them on top of each other is if index equals zero\nother is if index equals zero\nother is if index equals zero and if the destination\nand if the destination\nand if the destination is left or right so if the destination\nis left or right so if the destination\nis left or right so if the destination was zero we\nwas zero we\nwas zero we we don't need to shuffle back yet so\nwe don't need to shuffle back yet so\nwe don't need to shuffle back yet so if index is zero and destination is\nif index is zero and destination is\nif index is zero and destination is different from zero\nand now for each card component we can\nand now for each card component we can listen to the shuffleback animation\nlisten to the shuffleback animation\nlisten to the shuffleback animation value if it is true we need to animate\nvalue if it is true we need to animate\nvalue if it is true we need to animate and for this we're going to use use\nand for this we're going to use use\nand for this we're going to use use animated reaction\nanimated reaction\nanimated reaction which lets us listen to an anime a\nwhich lets us listen to an anime a\nwhich lets us listen to an anime a change in animation value and react to\nchange in animation value and react to\nchange in animation value and react to it so use animated reaction\nit so use animated reaction\nit so use animated reaction on\non\non shuffleback\nand here i get it as\nand here i get it as parameter of the second but of course we\nparameter of the second but of course we\nparameter of the second but of course we could use shuffleback directly\ncould use shuffleback directly\ncould use shuffleback directly i mean i'm not sure whatever\ni mean i'm not sure whatever\ni mean i'm not sure whatever uh if value\nuh if value\nuh if value no actually let me just i think it's\nno actually let me just i think it's\nno actually let me just i think it's much more explicit i don't know i don't\nmuch more explicit i don't know i don't\nmuch more explicit i don't know i don't know which way is better\nknow which way is better\nknow which way is better so if we need to shuffle back\nso if we need to shuffle back\nso if we need to shuffle back we are going to set\nwe are going to set\nwe are going to set the x value back to zero so x\nthe x value back to zero so x\nthe x value back to zero so x that value equals with\nthat value equals with\nthat value equals with spring\nspring\nspring so to zero\nso to zero\nso to zero and we are we want to add some delay\nand we want also maybe to add rotate z\nand we want also maybe to add rotate z back to the random value so rotate z dot\nback to the random value so rotate z dot\nback to the random value so rotate z dot value is with spring\nso now they will all appear at the same\nso now they will all appear at the same time so again we need some delay value\nhere so here it's a spring\nhere so here it's a spring um\num\num [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] let me put maybe 150 milliseconds so\nlet me put maybe 150 milliseconds so\nlet me put maybe 150 milliseconds so time index\ntime index\ntime index so here we can add with delay\nand when the animation is over\nand when the animation is over so here we can look at any\nso here we can look at any\nso here we can look at any the callback of either animation\nthe callback of either animation\nthe callback of either animation when it's over i simply want to set\nwhen it's over i simply want to set\nwhen it's over i simply want to set shuffle back\nshuffle back\nshuffle back back to false\nback to false\nback to false um sorry i have some yeah so the second\num sorry i have some yeah so the second\num sorry i have some yeah so the second parameter would be the spring config\nparameter would be the spring config\nparameter would be the spring config here i keep the default\nhere i keep the default\nhere i keep the default and then\nand then\nand then we can have the callback for when the\nwe can have the callback for when the\nwe can have the callback for when the animation is over let's have a look\nso the cards appear nicely\nso the cards appear nicely up\nup\nup swiping\nswiping\nswiping and you see\nand you see\nand you see they shuffled back nicely isn't that\nthey shuffled back nicely isn't that\nthey shuffled back nicely

    "title": "How to add gestures to an Expo App | Universal App tutorial #6",
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q48LLvTGDU",
    "text": "Welcome to chapter six.\nGestures are a great way to provide an intuitive user experience in your app.\nThe React Native Gesture Handler library provides built in native components\nthat can handle gestures.\nIt recognizes pan, tap, rotation, and other gestures\nusing the platform's native touch handling system.\nIn this chapter, we'll add two different gestures using this library.\nDouble tap to scale the size of the emoji sticker,\nand pan to move the sticker around the screen\nso that the user can place the sticker anywhere on the image.\nWe will also use ReAnimated library to animate between\ngesture states.\nOkay, so here we are in our app.\nAnd by the way, something very important is that the template,\nwhen you create a new Expo app already comes\nwith React Native Gesture Handler and the ReAnimated library.\nAnd you can double check these by going to the package.json of your app,\nand you'll find React Native ReAnimated.\nIf you don't have this dependency on your app, just go ahead and install it.\nYou can find the instructions in the documentation.\nSo in this case I already have ReAnimated and Gesture Handler.\nSo make sure that you have these two installed.\nNow let's close the package.json to get the gesture interactions\nto work in the app.\nWe need to wrap the entry point of our application in a gesture\nhandler root view.\nI'm already kind of wrapping my RootLayout in here.\nSo instead of using this empty tag, I'd use the GestureHandlerRootView component\nand I'll close a tag as well.\nOkay.\nNotice that this is coming from gesture handler.\nAnd now let me hit save.\nNow to make sure that this is taking the entire space available\non my screen, I’ll add a style with Flex:1.\nNext step is going to be animating my sticker component.\nSo here I have my emoji sticker\nan animated component looks at the style property of the component and determines\nwhich values to animate and apply the updates to create an animation.\nLet's import animated from React Native ReAnimated.\nThis animated component allows us to animate\ncomponents like views, text, scroll views, or images.\nIn this case, let's go down here.\nAnd because I want to animate this image, let's go ahead and say animated.image.\nNow we are getting a TypeScript error in here.\nAnd it says that the type string is not assignable to a type image source\nprop type.\nSo we can cast this by using this type from React Native.\nAnd this would get rid of the error.\nAnother thing that I do want now that I'm here, it's apply a resize\nmode to the image to make sure that the image always looks good.\nLet's apply it contain. Cool.\nSo now I'll go to the top of my file and I'll import gesture and gesture detector.\nThese methods come from react native gesture handler and allows\nus to detect touch input like double tap.\nI'll go ahead and compliment my import from React Native ReAnimated\nand I'll import as well useAnimatedStyle, useSharedValue and withSpring.\nSo we want to be changing the size of the image.\nAnd that means that we need to be changing the height\nand width of the image depending on the gesture of the user.\nNow, if we were to use Usestate, for example, to drag this height and width\nstate, that would trigger a rerender every time that these values change.\nSo in this case we use useSharedValue. useSharedValue\nbasically is like useState.\nBut when these value changes we won't be triggering a rerendering.\nInstead, we can use these values to animate the view in an optimal manner.\nSo inside the emoji sticker I'll create this variable scale image\nusing useSharedValue, passing the image size as the initial value.\nSo as you can see here, this is a number.\nAnd this is going to be the initial value.\nNow when we want to access this value\nwe can say .value and this will be\nthe value that is going to be changing depending on the gestures of the user.\nAll right.\nSo after this I will create a tap\ngesture handler using gesture.\nWe are importing this from React Native gesture handler.\nAnd we can say number of taps.\nSo I'm setting this to be two.\nAnd when the user does that we want to start this logic.\nSo when the user double taps on the sticker\nwe want to increase the size to the double right.\nBut if the size was already the double of the image,\nwhen the user does double tap, we want to decrease the size again.\nSo that's why we are validating here.\nIf the scale value is different than the image size times two.\nIf this is the case then we want to set it to the scale image.\nThat's value times two. Otherwise we want to\nset it to the previous value\nwhich is going to be the same thing divided by two.\nNow we're using math round because we don't want to have decimals.\nAfter that I will create an image style\nusing the useAnimatedstyle.\nWe can use this from reReAnimated.\nAnd this is going to return this style that is going to be changing\ndepending on the gestures. Right.\nWe can pass a withSpring\nwhich is going to create the animation with a nice spring animation.\nSo this is going to take the width withSpring\nto these value, which is the scaleImage.value.\nOkay.\nSo we have the new animated style and we have the double tap gesture.\nNow we need to apply it in here.\nSo I will wrap this into a gesture detector.\nAnd this gesture detector is getting the gesture with a double tap.\nAnd then in the animated image I'm passing the image style,\nwhich is an animated style that is going to be changing\ndepending on the scale image value.\nLet me cast this again and hit save.\nOkay, so I save the changes.\nLet's use this photo on my device.\nI'll select an emoji and let's use this one.\nAnd if I do double tap you can see that\nthe image is increasing with this spring animation.\nAnd if I double tap again it's decreasing.\nVery cool.\nNow apart from this gesture we also want the user\nto be able to drag and drop the sticker.\nSo we can do that as well by keeping track of the image\nposition x and position y.\nAnd we can use a shared value for that.\nSo we are going to start x(0) and y(0).\nAnd then down here we want to move the entire view right.\nSo let's change this to be an animated view.\nAnd I'll close this with animated view as well.\nNow let's create the gesture for dragging.\nAnd this is how it looks.\nI'm using the gesture pan on change.\nAnd this is going to detect when the user is dragging\nand is going to return an event which is going to contain the new position\nx and new position y.\nThen I can use this new position to set the translate x and y values.\nSo this is going to start at zero.\nBut as soon as I start moving this around\nthis is going to add the new position on x and y to these values.\nOnce we have these values we can create a new style,\nanimated style, using the Animated style.\nAnd we are going to use the transform property of this style.\nThis is going to take two objects.\nThe first one is going to be translating these on the x axis, and the other one\non the y axis, just passing the values that we are getting from these drag.\nNow let's come here and add an array of styles.\nThis is going to be containerStyle.\nAnd this style is going to remain the same.\nAnd similarly at what we did with this gesture detector,\nwe can simply copy and wrap the entire view in a gesture detector.\nSo let me close this tag down here.\nBut instead of having the double tap I want to handle the drag in this one.\nSo let's go ahead and hit save.\nAnd now let's see if this works.\nI'm double tapping.\nAnd if I press and drag you can see that this is working very nicely.\nAnd whenever I, you know, release this, it's going to remain in that position.\nPretty cool.\nBy the way, we can replace this by selecting a new emoji.\nSo if we want to change that we can do that\nand double tap to make it a smaller double tap to make it bigger.\nAnd this works very nicely. Great work.\nYou've now learned how to implement gestures using React Native Gesture\nHandler, allowing users to double tap to scale and pan to move the emoji sticker.\nPlus, you explored how to animate gesture states with their ReAnimated library.\nI hope you liked this chapter and I'll see you in the next one."

let's jump into building it\n[Applause]\n[Applause] [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] to a moment nothing happens but what we\nto a moment nothing happens but what we\nto a moment nothing happens but what we want to do is to actually have this nice\nwant to do is to actually have this nice\nwant to do is to actually have this nice swipe up to unlock the device animes\nswipe up to unlock the device animes\nswipe up to unlock the device animes animation that will be driven by the\nanimation that will be driven by the\nanimation that will be driven by the gesture of the user so let's see how we\ngesture of the user so let's see how we\ngesture of the user so let's see how we can do that well for that we're gonna\ncan do that well for that we're gonna\ncan do that well for that we're gonna use gesture Handler together with\nuse gesture Handler together with\nuse gesture Handler together with renimated so if we go into direct\nrenimated so if we go into direct\nrenimated so if we go into direct reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated documentation we have here a use\ndocumentation we have here a use\ndocumentation we have here a use animator gesture Handler but for that to\nanimator gesture Handler but for that to\nanimator gesture Handler but for that to work we first need to install and\nwork we first need to install and\nwork we first need to install and configure gesture Handler in our project\nconfigure gesture Handler in our project\nconfigure gesture Handler in our project so let's go in our project and do npx\nso let's go in our project and do npx\nso let's go in our project and do npx Expo install react native gesture\nExpo install react native gesture\nExpo install react native gesture Handler The Next Step would be to wrap\nHandler The Next Step would be to wrap\nHandler The Next Step would be to wrap our application in a gesture Handler\nour application in a gesture Handler\nour application in a gesture Handler root view so let's go ahead in our\nroot view so let's go ahead in our\nroot view so let's go ahead in our app.js and we are going to import here\napp.js and we are going to import here\napp.js and we are going to import here and the top import react native gesture\nand the top import react native gesture\nand the top import react native gesture Handler we're going to import the\nHandler we're going to import the\nHandler we're going to import the gesture Handler root view this one this\ngesture Handler root view this one this\ngesture Handler root view this one this component we always need to wrap our\ncomponent we always need to wrap our\ncomponent we always need to wrap our application with it in order for our\napplication with it in order for our\napplication with it in order for our application to properly manage the\napplication to properly manage the\napplication to properly manage the gesture Handler so we can actually\ngesture Handler so we can actually\ngesture Handler so we can actually replace this view with our gesture\nreplace this view with our gesture\nreplace this view with our gesture Handler root view because it extends a\nHandler root view because it extends a\nHandler root view because it extends a view and it supports the style so now\nview and it supports the style so now\nview and it supports the style so now everything is okay everything is\neverything is okay everything is\neverything is okay everything is prepared for the next step our next step\nprepared for the next step our next step\nprepared for the next step our next step is going to be where going back to our\nis going to be where going back to our\nis going to be where going back to our animated we're gonna use the use\nanimated we're gonna use the use\nanimated we're gonna use the use animated gesture Handler in order to\nanimated gesture Handler in order to\nanimated gesture Handler in order to drive some animation for our gestures so\ndrive some animation for our gestures so\ndrive some animation for our gestures so first of all we are going to have to\nfirst of all we are going to have to\nfirst of all we are going to have to define the area where we want to handle\ndefine the area where we want to handle\ndefine the area where we want to handle the gestures and we kind of Define the\nthe gestures and we kind of Define the\nthe gestures and we kind of Define the whole screen as the gesture Handler\nwhole screen as the gesture Handler\nwhole screen as the gesture Handler because for example in the middle of the\nbecause for example in the middle of the\nbecause for example in the middle of the screen if we scroll we want to scroll\nscreen if we scroll we want to scroll\nscreen if we scroll we want to scroll the list like this part is regarding\nthe list like this part is regarding\nthe list like this part is regarding scrolling the list what we can do is to\nscrolling the list what we can do is to\nscrolling the list what we can do is to Define here on the bottom like a small\nDefine here on the bottom like a small\nDefine here on the bottom like a small part part of a screen that will actually\npart part of a screen that will actually\npart part of a screen that will actually handle these gestures of unlocking the\nhandle these gestures of unlocking the\nhandle these gestures of unlocking the phone and this actually happens on the\nphone and this actually happens on the\nphone and this actually happens on the iOS screen as well because here in the\niOS screen as well because here in the\niOS screen as well because here in the middle if we scroll we will we are not\nmiddle if we scroll we will we are not\nmiddle if we scroll we will we are not unlocking the phone but if we start\nunlocking the phone but if we start\nunlocking the phone but if we start scrolling from the bottom here then we\nscrolling from the bottom here then we\nscrolling from the bottom here then we are actually unlocking the phone so\nare actually unlocking the phone so\nare actually unlocking the phone so let's go ahead in our lock screen and uh\nlet's go ahead in our lock screen and uh\nlet's go ahead in our lock screen and uh we're gonna import a component from\nwe're gonna import a component from\nwe're gonna import a component from gesture Handler which is called Pawn\ngesture Handler which is called Pawn\ngesture Handler which is called Pawn gesture Handler from react native\ngesture Handler from react native\ngesture Handler from react native gesture Handler alright so using this\ngesture Handler alright so using this\ngesture Handler alright so using this component this component is going to\ncomponent this component is going to\ncomponent this component is going to help us detect pan gestures basically\nhelp us detect pan gestures basically\nhelp us detect pan gestures basically drag drags over them the screen so let's\ndrag drags over them the screen so let's\ndrag drags over them the screen so let's go ahead and render it somewhere on the\ngo ahead and render it somewhere on the\ngo ahead and render it somewhere on the bottom of the screen probably I'm gonna\nbottom of the screen probably I'm gonna\nbottom of the screen probably I'm gonna do it like right after the swipe up to\ndo it like right after the swipe up to\ndo it like right after the swipe up to open let's go ahead and render the bun\nopen let's go ahead and render the bun\nopen let's go ahead and render the bun gesture Handler and inside the pan\ngesture Handler and inside the pan\ngesture Handler and inside the pan gesture Handler we need to render an\ngesture Handler we need to render an\ngesture Handler we need to render an animated view animated view that we are\nanimated view animated view that we are\nanimated view animated view that we are gonna give some styles for example let's\ngonna give some styles for example let's\ngonna give some styles for example let's give right away the background color red\ngive right away the

bottom 0 and left zero okay why it's\nbottom 0 and left zero okay why it's\nbottom 0 and left zero okay why it's here let me actually try to move it\nhere let me actually try to move it\nhere let me actually try to move it outside of our footer this is our footer\noutside of our footer this is our footer\noutside of our footer this is our footer so I'm gonna move it outside of our\nso I'm gonna move it outside of our\nso I'm gonna move it outside of our footer like this and now it actually\nfooter like this and now it actually\nfooter like this and now it actually displays properly where we want it to be\ndisplays properly where we want it to be\ndisplays properly where we want it to be don't bother about the background color\ndon't bother about the background color\ndon't bother about the background color red because once we are done we will\nred because once we are done we will\nred because once we are done we will uncomment this out and we will not see\nuncomment this out and we will not see\nuncomment this out and we will not see this this view but it will be there and\nthis this view but it will be there and\nthis this view but it will be there and it will be ready to handle our pan\nit will be ready to handle our pan\nit will be ready to handle our pan gestures so I'm gonna leave it with red\ngestures so I'm gonna leave it with red\ngestures so I'm gonna leave it with red just for us to at least see it on the\njust for us to at least see it on the\njust for us to at least see it on the screen and understand what's uh what's\nscreen and understand what's uh what's\nscreen and understand what's uh what's happening there so now let's define the\nhappening there so now let's define the\nhappening there so now let's define the Handler for our pan gesture Handler and\nHandler for our pan gesture Handler and\nHandler for our pan gesture Handler and that will be the place where we will\nthat will be the place where we will\nthat will be the place where we will write our logic so for that we're gonna\nwrite our logic so for that we're gonna\nwrite our logic so for that we're gonna use the use gesture Handler Hook from\nuse the use gesture Handler Hook from\nuse the use gesture Handler Hook from react uh renimated I don't see reactor\nreact uh renimated I don't see reactor\nreact uh renimated I don't see reactor animated here but it's oh here animated\nanimated here but it's oh here animated\nanimated here but it's oh here animated so we need them use animated gesture\nso we need them use animated gesture\nso we need them use animated gesture Handler and let's define it here const\nHandler and let's define it here const\nHandler and let's define it here const unlock gesture Handler equal use\nunlock gesture Handler equal use\nunlock gesture Handler equal use animated gesture Handler and here we\nanimated gesture Handler and here we\nanimated gesture Handler and here we need to specify an object with our\nneed to specify an object with our\nneed to specify an object with our events that we want to handle there are\nevents that we want to handle there are\nevents that we want to handle there are a couple of events one of them is for\na couple of events one of them is for\na couple of events one of them is for example one start basically whenever we\nexample one start basically whenever we\nexample one start basically whenever we start that gesture we have our own\nstart that gesture we have our own\nstart that gesture we have our own active and this is whenever we keep like\nactive and this is whenever we keep like\nactive and this is whenever we keep like dragging through the screen this will\ndragging through the screen this will\ndragging through the screen this will always be cold and lastly we have it on\nalways be cold and lastly we have it on\nalways be cold and lastly we have it on and that will be called when we end our\nand that will be called when we end our\nand that will be called when we end our gesture so let's go ahead and start with\ngesture so let's go ahead and start with\ngesture so let's go ahead and start with some console log on start let's do the\nsome console log on start let's do the\nsome console log on start let's do the same for the other just to see on active\nsame for the other just to see on active\nsame for the other just to see on active and here on end now this unlock gesture\nand here on end now this unlock gesture\nand here on end now this unlock gesture Handler we can send to our Pawn gesture\nHandler we can send to our Pawn gesture\nHandler we can send to our Pawn gesture Handler as on gesture event unlock\nHandler as on gesture event unlock\nHandler as on gesture event unlock gesture Handler now let's look at our\ngesture Handler now let's look at our\ngesture Handler now let's look at our logs and let's start dragging starting\nlogs and let's start dragging starting\nlogs and let's start dragging starting from the red area so if I'm gonna start\nfrom the red area so if I'm gonna start\nfrom the red area so if I'm gonna start from somewhere else I don't see anything\nfrom somewhere else I don't see anything\nfrom somewhere else I don't see anything but if I'm gonna start from here yes one\nbut if I'm gonna start from here yes one\nbut if I'm gonna start from here yes one active on end and when we start we see\nactive on end and when we start we see\nactive on end and when we start we see on start then on active as long as we\non start then on active as long as we\non start then on active as long as we are dragging in advance on end the cool\nare dragging in advance on end the cool\nare dragging in advance on end the cool thing is that all of his events they\nthing is that all of his events they\nthing is that all of his events they contain some information for example we\ncontain some information for example we\ncontain some information for example we will receive them here in the event so\nwill receive them here in the event so\nwill receive them here in the event so in their own active if I'm going to\nin their own active if I'm going to\nin their own active if I'm going to console log the event we're gonna see\nconsole log the event we're gonna see\nconsole log the event we're gonna see what information we know about with drag\nwhat information we know about with drag\nwhat information we know about with drag event so if I'm gonna do like this this\nevent so if I'm gonna do like this this\nevent so if I'm gonna do like this this is the object and we see a lot of things\nis the object and we see a lot of things\nis the object and we see a lot of things like absolute X absolute y the event\nlike absolute X absolute y the event\nlike absolute X absolute y the event name what we are interested in actually\nname what we are interested in actually\nname what we are interested in actually is the translation Y and we specify how\nis the translation Y and we specify how\nis the translation Y and we specify how much did we move a finger on the y-axis\nmuch did we move a finger on the y-axis\nmuch did we move a finger on the y-axis and there is also translation X which in\nand there is also translation X which in\nand there is also translation X which in this situation we are not interested in\nthis situation we are not interested in\nthis situation we are not interested in but in our situation we also need it\nbut in our situation we also need it\nbut in our situation we also need it because this indicates how far did we\nbecause this indicates how far did we\nbecause this indicates how far did we move our finger on the x axis So based\nmove our finger on the x axis So based\nmove our finger on the x axis So based on this translation why let's go ahead\non this translation why let's go ahead\non this translation why let's go ahead and save this translation Y in a shared\nand save this translation Y in a shared\nand save this translation Y in a shared value because this translation y will\nvalue because this translation y will\nvalue because this translation y will drive a lot of animations for example as\ndrive a lot of animations for example as\ndrive a lot of animations for example as we move our finger up we also need to\nwe move our finger up we also need to\nwe move our finger up we also need to move the whole lock screen in and reveal\nmove the whole lock screen in and reveal\nmove the whole lock screen in and reveal the home screen underneath right so\nthe home screen underneath right so\nthe home screen underneath right so let's go ahead and have here a const I'm\nlet's go ahead and have here a const I'm\nlet's go ahead and have here a const I'm gonna do just why use shared value\ngonna do just why use shared value\ngonna do just why use shared value initially is going to be zero now let's\ninitially is going to be zero now let's\ninitially is going to be zero now let's go ahead and in the on active we're\ngo ahead and in the on active we're\ngo ahead and in the on active we're gonna say why dot value equal to event\ngonna say why dot value equal to event\ngonna say why dot value equal to event dot translation Y and at the moment\ndot translation Y and at the moment\ndot translation Y and at the moment nothing will change but based on this y\nnothing will change but based on this y\nnothing will change but based on this y value we can uh we can move a bit with\nvalue we can uh we can move a bit with\nvalue we can uh we can move a bit with container for example if I'm gonna to\ncontainer for example if I'm gonna to\ncontainer for example if I'm gonna to manually add a transform Translate Y for\nmanually add a transform Translate Y for\nmanually add a transform Translate Y for example 100 then we're gonna see how our\nexample 100 then we're gonna see how our\nexample 100 then we're gonna see how our screen moves below but if I'm gonna do\nscreen moves below but if I'm gonna do\nscreen moves below but if I'm gonna do minus 100 it's gonna move in that\nminus 100 it's gonna move in that\nminus 100 it's gonna move in that direction upwards so this is the\ndirection upwards so this is the\ndirection upwards so this is the property that we want to animate based\nproperty that we want to animate based\nproperty that we want to animate based on our y value that we get from the\non our y value that we get from the\non our y value that we get from the gesture Handler from the finger of the\ngesture Handler from the finger of the\ngesture Handler from the finger of the person so for that we're going to to\nperson so for that we're going to to\nperson so for that we're going to to have an animated style similar to how we\nhave an animated style similar to how we\nhave an animated style similar to how we had it for the footer but in this case\nhad it for the footer but in this case\nhad it for the footer but in this case is for our whole container so container\nis for our whole container so container\nis for our whole container so container animated container style use animated\nanimated container style use animated\nanimated container style use animated style and here we need to provide a\nstyle and here we need to provide a\nstyle and here we need to provide a function that will create this style so\nfunction that will create this style so\nfunction that will create this style so as we said we want to animate that\nas we said we want to animate that\nas we said we want to animate that transform and specifically that\ntransform and specifically that\ntransform and specifically that translate why using the value from our\ntranslate why using the value from our\ntranslate why using the value from our shared value like this and here we\nshared value like this and here we\nshared value like this and here we should have an object like this now\nshould have an object like this now\nshould have an object like this now let's go ahead and send this animated\nlet's go ahead and send this animated\nlet's go ahead and send this animated container style to our image background\ncontainer style to our image background\ncontainer style to our image background but we need to check if animated\nbut we need to check if animated\nbut we need to check if animated contains the image background property I\ncontains the image background property I\ncontains the image background property I don't think it does so for that reason\ndon't think it does so for that reason\ndon't think it does so for that reason we're gonna move a bit of things around\nwe're gonna move a bit of things around\nwe're gonna move a bit of things around for example we're going to rub our whole\nfor example we're going to rub our whole\nfor example we're going to rub our whole component in a view in an animated view\ncomponent in a view in an animated view\ncomponent in a view in an animated view like this let's close it at the end so\nlike this let's close it at the end so\nlike this let's close it at the end so that our image background will be a\nthat our image background will be a\nthat our image background will be a child of our animated view okay\nchild of our animated view okay\nchild of our animated view okay something something is showing up I\nsomething something is showing up I\nsomething something is showing up I don't need that transform here anymore\ndon't need that transform here anymore\ndon't need that transform here anymore I'm Gonna Leave it\nI'm Gonna Leave it\nI'm Gonna Leave it styles.container what's going on here\nstyles.container what's going on here\nstyles.container what's going on here let's do here Styles dot container and\nlet's do here Styles dot container and\nlet's do here Styles dot container and here we don't need a thousand container\nhere we don't need a thousand container\nhere we don't need a thousand container or maybe we need container one does it\nor maybe we need container one does it\nor maybe we need container one does it specify Flex one and wave 100 yeah let's\nspecify Flex one and wave 100 yeah let's\nspecify Flex one and wave 100 yeah let's let's do it like this but for the\nlet's do it like this but for the\nlet's do it like this but for the animated view here we also want to send\nanimated view here we also want to send\nanimated view here we also want to send them animated container style that will\nthem animated container style that will\nthem animated container style that will move up and down our component as we\nmove up and down our component as we\nmove up and down our component as we drag the finger on the screen so let's\ndrag the finger on the screen so let's\ndrag the finger on the screen so let's add here we have animated container\nadd here we have animated container\nadd here we have animated container style and let's give it a try if I drag\nstyle and let's give it a try if I drag\nstyle and let's give it a try if I drag from here and move up as we can see\nfrom here and move up as we can see\nfrom here and move up as we can see right away our animations are working\nright away our animations are working\nright away our animations are working that's perfect so that means that we are\nthat's perfect so that means that we are\nthat's perfect so that means that we are on the right track one thing to smoothen\non the right track one thing to smoothen\non the right track one thing to smoothen up the animation is for the style of our\nup the animation is for the style of our\nup the animation is for the style of our container not to move with directly\ncontainer not to move with directly\ncontainer not to move with directly proportional with how our finger is\nproportional with how our finger is\nproportional with how our finger is moving but to use that timing animation\nmoving but to use that timing animation\nmoving but to use that timing animation in order to do these changes through a\nin order to do these changes through a\nin order to do these changes through a small period of time and that will\nsmall period of time and that will\nsmall period of time and that will improve this movements of this animation\nimprove this movements of this animation\nimprove this movements of this animation so it's going to be very easy for\nso it's going to be very easy for\nso it's going to be very easy for example we Translate Y will be with\nexample we Translate Y will be with\nexample we Translate Y will be with timing we'll try to follow the Y value\ntiming we'll try to follow the Y value\ntiming we'll try to follow the Y value with timing we need to import it from\nwith timing we need to import it from\nwith timing we need to import it from reanimated and now as you can see like\nreanimated and now as you can see like\nreanimated and now as you can see like probably we can play around with play a\nprobably we can play around with play a\nprobably we can play around with play a bit with it specifically with the easing\nbit with it specifically with the easing\nbit with it specifically with the easing or with the duration of 100 let me\nor with the duration of 100 let me\nor with the duration of 100 let me actually check on iOS don't like it very\nactually check on iOS don't like it very\nactually check on iOS don't like it very much to be honest I think it's because\nmuch to be honest I think it's because\nmuch to be honest I think it's because of using but I didn't have time to learn\nof using but I didn't have time to learn\nof using but I didn't have time to learn a lot about easing it's the way our time\na lot about easing it's the way our time\na lot about easing it's the way our time timing function works so there are\ntiming function works so there are\ntiming function works so there are different easing functions and I'm gonna\ndifferent easing functions and I'm gonna\ndifferent easing functions and I'm gonna look here easing functions just show you\nlook here easing functions just show you\nlook here easing functions just show you what I mean by that and the standard\nwhat I mean by that and the standard\nwhat I mean by that and the standard easing I think should be something like\neasing I think should be something like\neasing I think should be something like this one is in outside where we slowly\nthis one is in outside where we slowly\nthis one is in outside where we slowly start when we accelerate and then slowly\nstart when we accelerate and then slowly\nstart when we accelerate and then slowly end what I'm interested in is something\nend what I'm interested in is something\nend what I'm interested in is something actually linear do we have something\nactually linear do we have something\nactually linear do we have something like linear easing where is my with\nlike linear easing where is my with\nlike linear easing where is my with timing here with timing and the easing\ntiming here with timing and the easing\ntiming here with timing and the easing will be easing dot linear yeah now it\nwill be easing dot linear yeah now it\nwill be easing dot linear yeah now it looks much better yeah I think that's\nlooks much better yeah I think that's\nlooks much better yeah I think that's what I needed a linear easing function\nwhat I needed a linear easing function\nwhat I needed a linear easing function for our timing animation so that it\nfor our timing animation so that it\nfor our timing animation so that it doesn't change like very weirdly\ndoesn't change like very weirdly\ndoesn't change like very weirdly throughout the animation it slowly moves\nthroughout the animation it slowly moves\nthroughout the animation it slowly moves towards the finger so our view is\ntowards the finger so our view is\ntowards the finger so our view is actually following uh the way we move on\nactually following uh the way we move on\nactually following uh the way we move on the screen but the problem is that as\nthe screen but the problem is that as\nthe screen but the problem is that as you can see it kind of stucks in the\nyou can see it kind of stucks in the\nyou can see it kind of stucks in the middle whenever we leave a finger so\nmiddle whenever we leave a finger so\nmiddle whenever we leave a finger so what we have to do is on the end for\nwhat we have to do is on the end for\nwhat we have to do is on the end for example we can right away say dot value\nexample we can right away say dot value\nexample we can right away say dot value equal 0 and that will make sure that\nequal 0 and that will make sure that\nequal 0 and that will make sure that when we end it will move back down but\nwhen we end it will move back down but\nwhen we end it will move back down but we don't always want to move the screen\nwe don't always want to move the screen\nwe don't always want to move the screen down because if it's more than half way\ndown because if it's more than half way\ndown because if it's more than half way uh to the top it actually should go up\nuh to the top it actually should go up\nuh to the top it actually should go up and unlock the screen so we're gonna\nand unlock the screen so we're gonna\nand unlock the screen so we're gonna have to do some checks if y dot value if\nhave to do some checks if y dot value if\nhave to do some checks if y dot value if current y dot value is more than half of\ncurrent y dot value is more than half of\ncurrent y dot value is more than half of a screen do we have a height we don't\na screen do we have a height we don't\na screen do we have a height we don't have a height let's get the height of a\nhave a height let's get the height of a\nhave a height let's get the height of a screen height using use Dimensions so\nscreen height using use Dimensions so\nscreen height using use Dimensions so we're gonna check if Y is more than high\nwe're gonna check if Y is more than high\nwe're gonna check if Y is more than high divided by two then what we want to do\ndivided by two then what we want to do\ndivided by two then what we want to do is actually we want to go to the\nis actually we want to go to the\nis actually we want to go to the position height and vice versa else we\nposition height and vice versa else we\nposition height and vice versa else we want to go to the zero so now if it's\nwant to go to the zero so now if it's\nwant to go to the zero so now if it's here it's gonna go to the zero if it's\nhere it's gonna go to the zero if it's\nhere it's gonna go to the zero if it's here it's gonna go also to the zero I\nhere it's gonna go also to the zero I\nhere it's gonna go also to the zero I think I know why because our y dot value\nthink I know why because our y dot value\nthink I know why because our y dot value is a negative value if I'm not mistaken\nis a negative value if I'm not mistaken\nis a negative value if I'm not mistaken if I'm gonna do that we see it's a\nif I'm gonna do that we see it's a\nif I'm gonna do that we see it's a negative negative value so we should do\nnegative negative value so we should do\nnegative negative value so we should do it a bit different if the negative value\nit a bit different if the negative value\nit a bit different if the negative value is less than minus High divided by 2\nis less than minus High divided by 2\nis less than minus High divided by 2 then okay when I need to move to the\nthen okay when I need to move to the\nthen okay when I need to move to the minus height as well so I'm gonna\nminus height as well so I'm gonna\nminus height as well so I'm gonna refresh if it's not enough it's going to\nrefresh if it's not enough it's going to\nrefresh if it's not enough it's going to go back if it's all the way to the top\ngo back if it's all the way to the top\ngo back if it's all the way to the top and if I release it here now I see it go\nand if I release it here now I see it go\nand if I release it here now I see it go to the top now you can see it better and\nto the top now you can see it better and\nto the top now you can see it better and yeah as I said it works as we wanted\nyeah as I said it works as we wanted\nyeah as I said it works as we wanted another thing that I want to implement\nanother thing that I want to implement\nanother thing that I want to implement right now is the thing is that if I very\nright now is the thing is that if I very\nright now is the thing is that if I very fast move it up it should always unlock\nfast move it up it should always unlock\nfast move it up it should always unlock it not only when I reach the top so for\nit not only when I reach the top so for\nit not only when I reach the top so for that we're gonna have to work also with\nthat we're gonna have to work also with\nthat we're gonna have to work also with the velocity of our movements so if I\nthe velocity of our movements so if I\nthe velocity of our movements so if I check here yeah let's get the event when\ncheck here yeah let's get the event when\ncheck here yeah let's get the event when we end this gesture and let's console\nwe end this gesture and let's console\nwe end this gesture and let's console log event dot uh velocity on the y-axis\nlog event dot uh velocity on the y-axis\nlog event dot uh velocity on the y-axis now if I'm gonna slowly move up and then\nnow if I'm gonna slowly move up and then\nnow if I'm gonna slowly move up and then release it my velocity is\nrelease it my velocity is\nrelease it my velocity is -83 pixels if I'm gonna do it very fast\n-83 pixels if I'm gonna do it very fast\n-83 pixels if I'm gonna do it very fast my velocity is 900 here and if I'm gonna\nmy velocity is 900 here and if I'm gonna\nmy velocity is 900 here and if I'm gonna do it even faster my velocity is 3000\ndo it even faster my velocity is 3000\ndo it even faster my velocity is 3000 here here is where we are unlocking and\nhere here is where we are unlocking and\nhere here is where we are unlocking and here is where we reset so if our\nhere is where we reset so if our\nhere is where we reset so if our velocity is less than minus some number\nvelocity is less than minus some number\nvelocity is less than minus some number minus 500 or something like that then we\nminus 500 or something like that then we\nminus 500 or something like that then we want to actually\nwant to actually\nwant to actually unlock our phone without checking these\nunlock our phone without checking these\nunlock our phone without checking these field values so we're gonna add here a\nfield values so we're gonna add here a\nfield values so we're gonna add here a war operator so if the velocity Y is\nwar operator so if the velocity Y is\nwar operator so if the velocity Y is less than minus 500 then we want to\nless than minus 500 then we want to\nless than minus 500 then we want to unlock it and now if I'm gonna slowly\nunlock it and now if I'm gonna slowly\nunlock it and now if I'm gonna slowly move up and release it it's gonna come\nmove up and release it it's gonna come\nmove up and release it it's gonna come back but if I'm gonna do it fast then\nback but if I'm gonna do it fast then\nback but if I'm gonna do it fast then it's gonna unlock it so that's how we\nit's gonna unlock it so that's how we\nit's gonna unlock it so that's how we implement this event maybe it's too fast\nimplement this event maybe it's too fast\nimplement this event maybe it's too fast right if it's too fast then we can also\nright if it's too fast then we can also\nright if it's too fast then we can also slowly move to that direction for\nslowly move to that direction for\nslowly move to that direction for example example here we can do with\nexample example here we can do with\nexample example here we can do with timing to minus height based on some\ntiming to minus height based on some\ntiming to minus height based on some duration for example the duration to\nduration for example the duration to\nduration for example the duration to this would be I don't know 500\nthis would be I don't know 500\nthis would be I don't know 500 milliseconds and maybe the default 300\nmilliseconds and maybe the default 300\nmilliseconds and maybe the default 300 look will work better and as well we can\nlook will work better and as well we can\nlook will work better and as well we can provide the easing as easing.linear I\nprovide the easing as easing.linear I\nprovide the easing as easing.linear I think when we go to zero is okay no it's\nthink when we go to zero is okay no it's\nthink when we go to zero is okay no it's too fast so we're gonna do with timing\ntoo fast so we're gonna do with timing\ntoo fast so we're gonna do with timing here as well\nhere as well\nhere as well okay now it looks better alright so\nokay now it looks better alright so\nokay now it looks better alright so that's how we implement this gesture\nthat's how we implement this gesture\nthat's how we implement this gesture Handler here what we also can do is in\nHandler here what we also can do is in\nHandler here what we also can do is in our application go ahead and render the\nour application go ahead and render the\nour application go ahead and render the actual home screen it's going to be like\nactual home screen it's going to be like\nactual home screen it's going to be like a simple uh image I'm not gonna develop\na simple uh image I'm not gonna develop\na simple uh image I'm not gonna develop a home screen of iOS but it's gonna give\na home screen of iOS but it's gonna give\na home screen of iOS but it's gonna give us this impression that we are unlocking\nus this impression that we are unlocking\nus this impression that we are unlocking the screen so let's go ahead in the\nthe screen so let's go ahead in the\nthe screen so let's go ahead in the images and we have here home or Home2\nimages and we have here home or Home2\nimages and we have here home or Home2 let's import them home I think I'm gonna\nlet's import them home I think I'm gonna\nlet's import them home I think I'm gonna import home too because it has a better\nimport home too because it has a better\nimport home too because it has a better quality and I'm gonna render it\nquality and I'm gonna render

image\nHome Tool style let's close the image\nHome Tool style let's close the image and let's see if we have it uh we need\nand let's see if we have it uh we need\nand let's see if we have it uh we need to probably import the image from react\nto probably import the image from react\nto probably import the image from react native and here is the image if I\nnative and here is the image if I\nnative and here is the image if I refresh the image is displayed on top of\nrefresh the image is displayed on top of\nrefresh the image is displayed on top of a lock screen if I'm gonna do it like\na lock screen if I'm gonna do it like\na lock screen if I'm gonna do it like this our lock screen is displayed on top\nthis our lock screen is displayed on top\nthis our lock screen is displayed on top of the image and if I swipe up we see\nof the image and if I swipe up we see\nof the image and if I swipe up we see event we have a unlocking effect now\nevent we have a unlocking effect now\nevent we have a unlocking effect now let's go into the lock screen and remove\nlet's go into the lock screen and remove\nlet's go into the lock screen and remove this red background color from our from\nthis red background color from our from\nthis red background color from our from this View and also I think I'm gonna\nthis View and also I think I'm gonna\nthis View and also I think I'm gonna replace it with with a style here called\nreplace it with with a style here called\nreplace it with with a style here called one gesture container and let's copy all\none gesture container and let's copy all\none gesture container and let's copy all the styles from there styles on gesture\nthe styles from there styles on gesture\nthe styles from there styles on gesture container now yeah I think it looks good\ncontainer now yeah I think it looks good\ncontainer now yeah I think it looks good we don't have um red but our component\nwe don't have um red but our component\nwe don't have um red but our component is still working as expected and we can\nis still working as expected and we can\nis still working as expected and we can unlock that screen as we want I'm gonna\nunlock that screen as we want I'm gonna\nunlock that screen as we want I'm gonna render this image inside our lock screen\nrender this image inside our lock screen\nrender this image inside our lock screen just to have everything there in the\njust to have everything there in the\njust to have everything there in the lock screen and not work in the\nlock screen and not work in the\nlock screen and not work in the application so let's grab this image\napplication so let's grab this image\napplication so let's grab this image from here and move it in the lock screen\nfrom here and move it in the lock screen\nfrom here and move it in the lock screen somewhere on top probably we're gonna\nsomewhere on top probably we're gonna\nsomewhere on top probably we're gonna put it here first we're gonna put the\nput it here first we're gonna put the\nput it here first we're gonna put the image and then we're gonna have an\nimage and then we're gonna have an\nimage and then we're gonna have an animated View and yeah like here we have\nanimated View and yeah like here we have\nanimated View and yeah like here we have a lock screen basically and here we have\na lock screen basically and here we have\na lock screen basically and here we have the home screen we need to import the\nthe home screen we need to import the\nthe home screen we need to import the image we need to import Home2 in our\nimage we need to import Home2 in our\nimage we need to import Home2 in our lock screen and yeah now it works the\nlock screen and yeah now it works the\nlock screen and yeah now it works the same but the thing is that our home\nsame but the thing is that our home\nsame but the thing is that our home screen is here so it's going to make a\nscreen is here so it's going to make a\nscreen is here so it's going to make a little bit easier to implement the\nlittle bit easier to implement the\nlittle bit easier to implement the gesture that will actually lock the\ngesture that will actually lock the\ngesture that will actually lock the screen is moving from the top like from\nscreen is moving from the top like from\nscreen is moving from the top like from the top part from the very top should we\nthe top part from the very top should we\nthe top part from the very top should we make this a background image let's try\nmake this a background image let's try\nmake this a background image let's try image background because inside of it we\nimage background because inside of it we\nimage background because inside of it we need for example we need another Point\nneed for example we need

should unlock\nif it's less than that we should unlock\nif it's less than that we should unlock and if event velocity y probably that's\nand if event velocity y probably that's\nand if event velocity y probably that's going to be the same when we unlock we\ngoing to be the same when we unlock we\ngoing to be the same when we unlock we move it to zero we move it to the top\nmove it to zero we move it to the top\nmove it to zero we move it to the top and when we reset we move it to the\nand when we reset we move it to the\nand when we reset we move it to the height now let's check it out and if I'm\nheight now let's check it out and if I'm\nheight now let's check it out and if I'm gonna scroll up I'm gonna leave it here\ngonna scroll up I'm gonna leave it here\ngonna scroll up I'm gonna leave it here it comes back down own where it moves up\nit comes back down own where it moves up\nit comes back down own where it moves up if I'm gonna do it fast it's gonna move\nif I'm gonna do it fast it's gonna move\nif I'm gonna do it fast it's gonna move fast up the same with velocity should\nfast up the same with velocity should\nfast up the same with velocity should happen for the reset because if the\nhappen for the reset because if the\nhappen for the reset because if the velocity is very fast down we need to\nvelocity is very fast down we need to\nvelocity is very fast down we need to reset it well I'm gonna do them in\nreset it well I'm gonna do them in\nreset it well I'm gonna do them in separative statements because that's\nseparative statements because that's\nseparative statements because that's going to make a bit easier if event dot\ngoing to make a bit easier if event dot\ngoing to make a bit easier if event dot velocity Y is more than 500 then we need\nvelocity Y is more than 500 then we need\nvelocity Y is more than 500 then we need to well this is else if then we need to\nto well this is else if then we need to\nto well this is else if then we need to reset here is unlock I can make them\nreset here is unlock I can make them\nreset here is unlock I can make them into functions but I will put them like\ninto functions but I will put them like\ninto functions but I will put them like this unlock reset so now if I'm gonna\nthis unlock reset so now if I'm gonna\nthis unlock reset so now if I'm gonna scroll fast down it's gonna work yes\nscroll fast down it's gonna work yes\nscroll fast down it's gonna work yes it's so good now I can finally remove\nit's so good now I can finally remove\nit's so good now I can finally remove the red background and our gesture\nthe red background and our gesture\nthe red background and our gesture handlers for the lock and lock are\nhandlers for the lock and lock are\nhandlers for the lock and lock are working properly sweet so on start event\nworking properly sweet so on start event\nworking properly sweet so on start event we don't even need it okay so that's how\nwe don't even need it okay so that's how\nwe don't even need it okay so that's how your Implement gesture Handler in your\nyour Implement gesture Handler in your\nyour Implement gesture Handler in your application in order to drive some\napplication in order to drive some\napplication in order to drive some swiping animations for example in this\nswiping animations for example in this\nswiping animations for example in this application that we are building here\napplication that we are building here\napplication that we are building here where we are trying to reproduce iOS\nwhere we are trying to reproduce iOS\nwhere we are trying to reproduce iOS lock screen we implemented a gesture\nlock screen we implemented a gesture\nlock screen we implemented a gesture Handler to unlock uh the screen so as\nHandler to unlock uh the screen so as\nHandler to unlock uh the screen so as you can see we are the gesture Handler\nyou can see we are the gesture Handler\nyou can see we are the gesture Handler only works on the bottom part here\nonly works on the bottom part here\nonly works on the bottom part here because if we scroll in the middle part\nbecause if we scroll in the middle part\nbecause if we scroll in the middle part we're gonna scroll them a flat list but\nwe're gonna scroll them a flat list but\nwe're gonna scroll them a flat list but if we're gonna drag from the bottom our\nif we're gonna drag from the bottom our\nif we're gonna drag from the bottom our lock screen follows our finger and if we\nlock screen follows our finger and if we\nlock screen follows our finger and if we release it here on the top it will\nrelease it here on the top it will\nrelease it here on the top it will unlock the screen if we release it to\nunlock the screen if we release it to\nunlock the screen if we release it to the bottom half it will reset it back\nthe bottom half it will reset it back\nthe bottom half it will reset it back here but we also implemented some checks\nhere but we also implemented some checks\nhere but we also implemented some checks for velocity because if we swipe up very\nfor velocity because if we swipe up very\nfor velocity because if we swipe up very fast then it will unlock and that's how\nfast then it will unlock and that's how\nfast then it will unlock and that's how it works on iOS and the same thing for\nit works on iOS and the same thing for\nit works on iOS and the same thing for unlocking like if I swipe from the top\nunlocking like if I swipe from the top\nunlocking like if I swipe from the top of the screen down very fast then our\nof the screen down very fast then our\nof the screen down very fast then our screen will lock we're gonna see this\nscreen will lock we're gonna see this\nscreen will lock we're gonna see this lock screen so I hope it will learn\nlock screen so I hope it will learn\nlock screen so I hope it will learn something new today and if you enjoyed\nsomething new today and if you enjoyed\nsomething new today and

this simple and powerful animation react\nsimple and powerful animation react\nsimple and powerful animation react native using mainly the react native\nnative using mainly the react native\nnative using mainly the react native gesture handler package and the\ngesture handler package and the\ngesture handler package and the reanimated package\nreanimated package\nreanimated package so in this video we are going to\nso in this video we are going to\nso in this video we are going to introduce a new series called what about\nintroduce a new series called what about\nintroduce a new series called what about gestures the aim is to take an in-depth\ngestures the aim is to take an in-depth\ngestures the aim is to take an in-depth look at the react native animations\nlook at the react native animations\nlook at the react native animations closely related to gestures so obviously\nclosely related to gestures so obviously\nclosely related to gestures so obviously the animate with your animated series\nthe animate with your animated series\nthe animate with your animated series will not be interrupted and will\nwill not be interrupted and will\nwill not be interrupted and will continue to bring content related to\ncontinue to bring content related to\ncontinue to bring content related to animations so let me tell you that this\nanimations so let me tell you that

in\nchat heads example already uploaded in\nchat heads example already uploaded in the react native gesture handler\nthe react native gesture handler\nthe react native gesture handler repository so if you want to learn more\nrepository so if you want to learn more\nrepository so if you want to learn more about that check the link in the\nabout that check the link in the\nabout that check the link in the description\ndescription\ndescription that said we can finally move on the\nthat said we can finally move on the\nthat said we can finally move on the code part\nso here i've created a react native\nso here i've created a react native product with the latest version of the\nproduct with the latest version of the\nproduct with the latest version of the xbox sdk\nxbox sdk\nxbox sdk so\nso\nso here you can see that i'm using the\nhere you can see that i'm using the\nhere you can see that i'm using the version 44 of the express decay\nversion 44 of the express decay\nversion 44 of the express decay of course i've just installed\nof course i've just installed\nof course i've just installed upgraded the expo sdk on my computer and\nupgraded the expo sdk on my computer and\nupgraded the expo sdk on my computer and i've initialized the product from\ni've initialized the product from\ni've initialized the product from scratch with the type configuration\nscratch with the type configuration\nscratch with the type configuration i've also installed the react native\ni've also installed the react native\ni've also installed the react native just handler package we will need a\njust handler package we will need a\njust handler package we will need a version above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we are going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package with a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0 version so in order to complete the reanimated\nso in order to complete the reanimated\nso in order to complete the reanimated installation installation\ninstallation installation\ninstallation installation don't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin in the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js so that said we can start\nso that said we can start\nso that said we can start to display our circle\nto display our circle\nto display our circle on the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see here styles.circle\nhere styles.circle\nhere styles.circle and let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style so we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to 80\n80\n80 a width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say aspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1 and background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say blue\nblue\nblue so since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify here the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and for design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the opacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8 so\nso\nso at this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to see how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture handler works\nhandler works\nhandler works so\nso\nso normally\nnormally\nnormally if we want to\nif we want to\nif we want to translate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen we use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component from react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but with the\nwith the\nwith the version with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the so of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above the 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a gesture detector\ngesture detector\ngesture detector so uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh instead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin transfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth we can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture with the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component so uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate this view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view we are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated and in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we need to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture property\nproperty\nproperty so in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture property we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture right here\nright here\nright here so\nso\nso the default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version 2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler was to use the hook\nwas to use the hook\nwas to use the hook use animated\nuse animated\nuse animated use animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react natively animated\nnatively animated\nnatively animated so this one\nso this one\nso this one and here\nand here\nand here we can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks that we want to handle\nthat we want to handle\nthat we want to handle so instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach we can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component from the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler we can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan gesture\ngesture\ngesture and we can specify here\nand we can specify here\nand we can specify here all the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks so\nso\nso for instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation the default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active callback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update method\nmethod\nmethod so here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event and let's print\nand let's print\nand let's print the event translation x\nthe event translation x\nthe event translation x so of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this property to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector and let's reload\nso here\nso here you can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening you can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x values\nvalues\nvalues so\nso\nso in order to update\nin order to update\nin order to update this uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this translation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass the translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view so basically there are\nso basically there are\nso basically there are so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say minus different\nminus different\nminus different minus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two versions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler but what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is that right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on update callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler and not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated so this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between the previous approach but\nthe previous approach but\nthe previous approach but from the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that almost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing so here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to access the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex shared value\nshared value\nshared value and we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation x inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value and let's pass\nand let's pass\nand let's pass so let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value inside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated style\nstyle\nstyle so here let's return\nso here let's return\nso here let's return transform\ntransform\ntransform and let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex translatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value so if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this kind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and use animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my playlist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to reanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the video description of course\nvideo description of course\nvideo description of course so here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view and let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening so we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working nicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this animation\nanimation\nanimation you can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch so basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the translatex\ntranslatex\ntranslatex shared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and therefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping the previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart from the beginning\nfrom the beginning\nfrom the beginning so we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a second but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y so let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y shared value\nshared value\nshared value and let's save\nand let's save\nand let's save the event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here let's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style also the translate y value\nso let's reload\nso let's reload we can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y axis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis and if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same problem that we had before\nproblem that we had before\nproblem that we had before and in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need to store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state in um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object in the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture handler we\nhandler we\nhandler we deal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the the context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each different codec\ndifferent codec\ndifferent codec so here normally we would have access to\nso here normally we would have access to\nso here normally we would have access to this context object\nthis context object\nthis context object but in the latest version we need to\nbut in the latest version we need to\nbut in the latest version we need to handle ourselves this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as a shared value\na shared value\na shared value so let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object and let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state so inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to save two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and a y value\na y value\na y value and we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous position on the start callback\nposition on the start callback\nposition on the start callback so here\nso here\nso here that's the syntax we are going to handle\nthat's the syntax we are going to handle\nthat's the syntax we are going to handle here the context\nhere the context\nhere the context so let's let's say that we want to store\nso let's let's say that we want to store\nso let's let's say that we want to store inside this context the current position\ninside this context the current position\ninside this context the current position so let's say x equal to translate x\nso let's say x equal to translate x\nso let's say x equal to translate x value and y equal to translate y value\nvalue and y equal to translate y value\nvalue and y equal to translate y value and let's keep here let's access\nand let's keep here let's access\nand let's keep here let's access here the context dot value\nhere the context dot value\nhere the context dot value dot x\ndot x\ndot x and this context dot value\nand this context dot value\nand this context dot value dot y\ndot y\ndot y so let's reload\nso let's reload\nso let's reload and you can see that everything is\nand you can see that everything is\nand you can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so um\nso um\nso um we are able to scroll everywhere this\nwe are able to scroll everywhere this\nwe are able to scroll everywhere this kind of circle\nkind of circle\nkind of circle but it isn't the animation that we want\nbut it isn't the animation that we want\nbut it isn't the animation that we want so we don't want that this circle\nso we don't want that this circle\nso we don't want that this circle follows perfectly\nfollows perfectly\nfollows perfectly our our finger but we want\nour our finger but we want\nour our finger but we want that it follows with the spring\nthat it follows with the spring\nthat it follows with the spring animation\nanimation\nanimation and in order to do it\nand in order to do it\nand in order to do it let's define here\nlet's define here\nlet's define here the\nthe\nthe so let's uh derive the follow x position\nso let's uh derive the follow x position\nso let's uh derive the follow x position so this follow x position will be our\nso this follow x position will be our\nso this follow x position will be our circle x position\ncircle x position\ncircle x position we are going to derive the circle x\nwe are going to derive the circle x\nwe are going to derive the circle x position from the translate x value\nposition from the translate x value\nposition from the translate x value and we are going to derive the follow y\nand we are going to derive the follow y\nand we are going to derive the follow y position from this translate y value\nposition from this translate y value\nposition from this translate y value so let's specify here follow x and\nso let's specify here follow x and\nso let's specify here follow x and follow y\nso of course uh here nothing is changing\nso of course uh here nothing is changing we are just uh refactoring a little bit\nwe are just uh refactoring a little bit\nwe are just uh refactoring a little bit this code\nthis code\nthis code so you can see that we are using of\nso you can see that we are using of\nso you can see that we are using of course use the right value from\ncourse use the right value from\ncourse use the right value from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated but since we want to follow it with a\nbut since we want to follow it with a\nbut since we want to follow it with a spring animation\nspring animation\nspring animation let's specify here the width spring\nlet's specify here the width spring\nlet's specify here the width spring high order function from a reanimated\nhigh order function from a reanimated\nhigh order function from a reanimated so with spring\nso with spring\nso with spring and let's see what's going on\nand let's see what's going on\nand let's see what's going on so you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect right here\nright here\nright here so um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to do\ndo\ndo we are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle and the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this translatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow this follow x value and the follow y value\nfollow x value and the follow y value\nfollow x value and the follow y value so basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow this\nthis\nthis blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle so we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and over this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order to avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just create a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook basically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create a custom hook use\na custom hook use\na custom hook use called use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated position so here we are going to access the\nso here we are going to access the\nso here we are going to access the position that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's say animated position\nsay animated position\nsay animated position of course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this animated position type\nanimated position type\nanimated position type so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say this animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x and a y shared value\nand a y shared value\nand a y shared value so we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance the translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate y value\ny value\ny value so let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value and y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated shared value\nshared value\nshared value of type number\nof type number\nof type number and here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y so we are just going to copy all this\nso we are just going to copy all this\nso we are just going to copy all this logic\nlogic\nlogic and let's paste right here\nand let's paste right here\nand let's paste right here so instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are going to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x and the y value\nand the y value\nand the y value so let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are going to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow y\ny\ny and the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style so let's\nso let's\nso let's remove this logic\nremove this logic\nremove this logic and let's just say\nand let's just say\nand let's just say use follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated position x will be equal to translate x\nequal to translate x\nequal to translate x and y will be equal to translate y\nand y will be equal to translate y\nand y will be equal to translate y and we are going to access follow x\nand we are going to access follow x\nand we are going to access follow x follow y and reanimated style\nfollow y and reanimated style\nfollow y and reanimated style so\nso\nso basically here we um we have just\nbasically here we um we have just\nbasically here we um we have just refactored a little bit the code nothing\nrefactored a little bit the code nothing\nrefactored a little bit the code nothing is changing um it's just for uh the sake\nis changing um it's just for uh the sake\nis changing um it's just for uh the sake of clarity so uh right now we are going\nof clarity so uh right now we are going\nof clarity so uh right now we are going to replicate this logic so wrapping it\nto replicate this logic so wrapping it\nto replicate this logic so wrapping it inside the custom hook it's much more\ninside the custom hook it's much more\ninside the custom hook it's much more readable\nreadable\nreadable so um at this point let's create this\nso um at this point let's create this\nso um at this point let's create this red circle\nred circle\nred circle so here let's get rid of the this\nso here let's get rid of the this\nso here let's get rid of the this reanimated style and let's specify\nreanimated style and let's specify\nreanimated style and let's specify background color equal to red\nbackground color equal to red\nbackground color equal to red so let's reload\nso let's reload\nso let's reload so\nso\nso let's also add here the position\nlet's also add here the position\nlet's also add here the position absolute to this circle\nand we can see that nothing is working\nand we can see that nothing is working we need\nwe need\nwe need to tell to the red circle to follow the\nto tell to the red circle to follow the\nto tell to the red circle to follow the blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle and in order to do that\nand in order to do that\nand in order to do that let's reuse this custom hook\nlet's reuse this custom hook\nlet's reuse this custom hook and let's define\nand let's define\nand let's define so let's uh let's call it here\nso let's uh let's call it here\nso let's uh let's call it here reanimated blue circle style\nreanimated blue circle style\nreanimated blue circle style let's call it follow x will be our blue\nlet's call it follow x will be our blue\nlet's call it follow x will be our blue follow x\nfollow x\nfollow x follow y will be blue follow y\nfollow y will be blue follow y\nfollow y will be blue follow y and we are going to follow not the\nand we are going to follow not the\nand we are going to follow not the translatex but we are going to follow\ntranslatex but we are going to follow\ntranslatex but we are going to follow the blue follow x\nthe blue follow x\nthe blue follow x and the blue\nand the blue\nand the blue follow y\nfollow y\nfollow y so uh here it will be\nso uh here it will be\nso uh here it will be reanimated style it will be called\nreanimated style it will be called\nreanimated style it will be called reanimated red circle style\nreanimated red circle style\nreanimated red circle style so i hope that it is clear basically we\nso i hope that it is clear basically we\nso i hope that it is clear basically we are just following from this blue\nare just following from this blue\nare just following from this blue so we are just standing to the red\nso we are just standing to the red\nso we are just standing to the red circle to follow the blue\ncircle to follow the blue\ncircle to follow the blue uh the blue circle\nuh the blue circle\nuh the blue circle and we are just\nand we are just\nand we are just updating here the the name for\nupdating here the the name

style here\nstyle here\nstyle here and here let's say reanimate red circle\nand here let's say reanimate red circle\nand here let's say reanimate red circle style\nstyle\nstyle so i know that this explanation is a\nso i know that this explanation is a\nso i know that this explanation is a little bit messy but it is a little bit\nlittle bit messy but it is a little bit\nlittle bit messy but it is a little bit hard to\nhard to\nhard to explain it in a simple way\nexplain it in a simple way\nexplain it in a simple way but the concept is really simple we are\nbut the concept is really simple we are\nbut the concept is really simple we are just telling to each circle to follow\njust telling to each circle to follow\njust telling to each circle to follow the previous circle\nthe previous circle\nthe previous circle so you can see here that everything is\nso you can see here that everything is\nso you can see here that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so\nso\nso the last circle that we want to animate\nthe last circle that we want to animate\nthe last circle that we want to animate is the green circle and at this point it\nis the green circle and at this point it\nis the green circle and at this point it should be almost uh\nshould be almost uh\nshould be almost uh easy to understand how to do it\neasy to understand how to do it\neasy to understand how to do it we are just going to replicate this\nwe are just going to replicate this\nwe are just going to replicate this custom hook\ncustom hook\ncustom hook this one will be called\nthis one will be called\nthis one will be called let's say red followex\nlet's say red followex\nlet's say red followex red follow y\nred follow y\nred follow y and this one is going to be called uh\nand this one is going to be called uh\nand this one is going to be called uh reanimated uh\nreanimated uh\nreanimated uh no this one was was actually right\nno this one was was actually right\nno this one was was actually right so here we are going to follow from the\nso here we are going to follow from the\nso here we are going to follow from the green\ngreen\ngreen circle we are going to follow the red\ncircle we are going to follow the red\ncircle we are going to follow the red circle so red follow x and red follow y\ncircle so red follow x and red follow y\ncircle so red follow x and red follow y we are not going to use follow x and\nwe are not going to use follow x and\nwe are not going to use follow x and follow y\nfollow y\nfollow y and we are going to rename this style in\nand we are going to rename this style in\nand we are going to rename this style in green circle style\ngreen circle style\ngreen circle style so let's pass it right here\nso let's pass it right here\nso let's pass it right here so let's reload\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check is the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue circle\ncircle\ncircle so um let's say that we release the\nso um let's say that we release the\nso um let's say that we release the finger in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say that that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the left side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen we need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with the translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero otherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on the right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to animate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the translate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width so we can handle this on release gesture\nso we can handle this on release gesture\nso we can handle this on release gesture with the unend callback provided by the\nwith the unend callback provided by the\nwith the unend callback provided by the gesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen and here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check the current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this translatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen width\nwidth\nwidth we can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value equal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me fix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater than a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if this circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of the screen\nthe screen\nthe screen we need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value equal to screen width\nequal to screen width\nequal to screen width otherwise let's say translate x value\notherwise let's say translate x value\notherwise let's say translate x value equal to 0.\nequal to 0.\nequal to 0. so\nso\nso of course we need to\nof course we need to\nof course we need to define this screen width and as always\ndefine this screen width and as always\ndefine this screen width and as always we can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions api from react native\napi from react native\napi from react native so let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the screen width\nscreen width\nscreen width and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so\nso\nso nothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's because the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the center of the screen\ncenter of the screen\ncenter of the screen so we need to remove from the container\nso we need to remove from the container\nso we need to remove from the container style the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify content property\ncontent property\ncontent property and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this behavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to translate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen width but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value uh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value needs to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus 80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle so let's\nso let's\nso let's see what's going on\nsee what's going on\nsee what's going on and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly\nworking smoothly\nworking smoothly so let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80 let's define here the size equal to 80.\nsize here\nsize here and let's say\nand let's say\nand let's say size and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2. so uh\nso uh\nso uh of course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect uh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but you can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the animation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the width spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's because uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are not animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but we are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x parameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are are already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring animation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the translate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why so that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working nicely\nnicely\nnicely so thanks a lot for staying with me all\nso thanks a lot for staying with

principle\nprinciple\nprinciple we're gonna do gestures\nwe're gonna do gestures\nwe're gonna do gestures to a specific pen gestures\nto a specific pen gestures\nto a specific pen gestures one of the nice things about react\none of the nice things about react\none of the nice things about react native is that you are able to make\nnative is that you are able to make\nnative is that you are able to make really beautiful animations\nreally beautiful animations\nreally beautiful animations and the react native just a Handler\nand the react native just a Handler\nand the react native just a Handler Library allows us to create these\nLibrary allows us to create these\nLibrary allows us to create these beautiful gestures within our react\nbeautiful gestures within our react\nbeautiful gestures within our react native apps\nnative apps\nnative apps so right now I just have a simple square\nso right now I just have a simple square\nso right now I just have a simple square a red square\na red square\na red square and the code to this is not anything\nand the code to this is not anything\nand the code to this is not anything special you can just see it's just a\nspecial you can just see it's just a\nspecial you can just see it's just a simple text\nsimple text\nsimple text and a view the view is the has the\nand a view the view is the has the\nand a view the view is the has the styling of a square which you can see\nstyling of a square which you can see\nstyling of a square which you can see right here it's just a width of 150 a\nright here it's just a width of 150 a\nright here it's just a width of 150 a height of 150 in the parent color of red\nheight of 150 in the parent color of red\nheight of 150 in the parent color of red so what you're trying to do now is just\nso what you're trying to do now is just\nso what you're trying to do now is just we're gonna implement\nwe're gonna implement\nwe're gonna implement HSA Handler on this\nHSA Handler on this\nHSA Handler on this on this Square\non this Square\non this Square so the first thing which is obvious that\nso the first thing which is obvious that\nso the first thing which is obvious that we should do is to import the react\nwe should do is to import the react\nwe should do is to import the react native just a Handler Library\nso after we import the reactive design\nso after we import the reactive design Library uh the next thing that we have\nLibrary uh the next thing that we have\nLibrary uh the next thing that we have to do is to wrap\nto do is to wrap\nto do is to wrap our Square in\nour Square in\nour Square in HSA Handler\nHSA Handler\nHSA Handler so the pencil Handler allows us to\nso the pencil Handler allows us to\nso the pencil Handler allows us to add gesture events\nadd gesture events\nadd gesture events Within\nWithin\nWithin the whatever view that we have currently\nthe whatever view that we have currently\nthe whatever view that we have currently erupted\nerupted\nerupted so\nso we have that\nso we have that you'll notice that still nothing will is\nyou'll notice that still nothing will is\nyou'll notice that still nothing will is happening here\nhappening here\nhappening here so that's because we have to implement\nso that's because we have to implement\nso that's because we have to implement a function here\na function here\na function here which is the unjust event\nso the answer event uh method takes in a\nso the answer event uh method takes in a function\nfunction\nfunction so which we're gonna call on\nokay so we don't have that function yet\nokay so we don't have that function yet so we have to Define it here\nso we have to Define it here\nso we have to Define it here so const\nso const\nso const ant gesture hand\nant gesture hand\nant gesture hand then after we Define the function we\nthen after we Define the function we\nthen after we Define the function we have to\nhave to\nhave to Define what\nDefine what\nDefine what this\nthis\nthis is more for like a consonant will Doom\nis more for like a consonant will Doom\nis more for like a consonant will Doom before I go further\nbefore I go further\nbefore I go further so\nso\nso with uh\nwith uh\nwith uh animations in react native\nanimations in react native\nanimations in react native and if you're not going to use any other\nand if you're not going to use any other\nand if you're not going to use any other Library we normally use the animated\nLibrary we normally use the animated\nLibrary we normally use the animated value which is which is a default\nvalue which is which is a default\nvalue which is which is a default animation uh method so it's called\nanimation uh method so it's called\nanimation uh method so it's called animated so it allows us to do\nanimated so it allows us to do\nanimated so it allows us to do animations in react native and it\nanimations in react native and it\nanimations in react native and it normally takes in a value\nnormally takes in a value\nnormally takes in a value so\nso\nso so what's going to happen now when you\nso what's going to happen now when you\nso what's going to happen now when you do a chest\ndo a chest\ndo a chest so it has to be like an animated event\nso it has to be like an animated event\nso it has to be like an animated event so so we're just gonna change this L bit\nso so we're just gonna change this L bit\nso so we're just gonna change this L bit so this now will become\nso this now will become\nso this now will become and\nand\nand animated event\nso the animated event you have to\nso the animated event you have to just note what will happen for that\njust note what will happen for that\njust note what will happen for that event\nevent\nevent so that you normally do\nso that you normally do\nso that you normally do here so\nhere so\nhere so so\nso\nso we're gonna have like a native event\nwe're gonna have like a native event\nwe're gonna have like a native event we're just gonna\nwe're just gonna\nwe're just gonna translate uh X and translate why\ntranslate uh X and translate why\ntranslate uh X and translate why so this right here is is like\nso this right here is is like\nso this right here is is like um the default values or that you want\num the default values or that you want\num the default values or that you want to add for the gesture so I'm just going\nto add for the gesture so I'm just going\nto add for the gesture so I'm just going to Define them outside here\ntranslate X and then I'll set this one\ntranslate X and then I'll set this one to be a new animated value\nto be a new animated value\nto be a new animated value of zero so that would be like the\nof zero so that would be like the\nof zero so that would be like the default translation\ndefault translation\ndefault translation value for x and we're going to do the\nvalue for x and we're going to do the\nvalue for x and we're going to do the same thing for for y\nsame thing for for y\nsame thing for for y and then we're just gonna replace this\nand then we're just gonna replace this\nand then we're just gonna replace this guys here\nguys here\nguys here with what we've set up there\nso the native event will take these\nso the native event will take these initial values so whenever I doing a\ninitial values so whenever I doing a\ninitial values so whenever I doing a gesture it will follow\ngesture it will follow\ngesture it will follow the animated values which will change\nthe animated values which will change\nthe animated values which will change are based on an initial value of zero\nare based on an initial value of zero\nare based on an initial value of zero so and then we want to also use the\nso and then we want to also use the\nso and then we want to also use the native driver\nI'm gonna use the native driver so\nI'm gonna use the native driver so you're going to put it\nyou're going to put it\nyou're going to put it as\nas\nas true\nthe next thing that we're gonna do is\nthe next thing that we're gonna do is Gonna Save\nGonna Save\nGonna Save we're not getting any error but you'll\nwe're not getting any error but you'll\nwe're not getting any error but you'll notice that we're still not getting any\nnotice that we're still not getting any\nnotice that we're still not getting any animations there\nso\nso what has to happen now is that we\nwhat has to happen now is that we\nwhat has to happen now is that we actually\nactually\nactually have to\nhave to\nhave to change the view because this view is not\nchange the view because this view is not\nchange the view because this view is not animated so we have to also set it to be\nanimated so we have to also set it to be\nanimated so we have to also set it to be an animated View\nthat view\nthat view and then after we set it to be an\nand then after we set it to be an\nand then after we set it to be an animated view we have to Define\nanimated

    "text": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\nHello, Free Code Campers.\nWelcome to this workshop on declarative gestures\nand animations in React Native.\nI'm William, maker of the \"Can it be done in React Native\" YouTube series\nIn this workshop, I would like us to do five things.\nFirst, to discuss why the topic of gestures and animations\nis so peculiar in React Native, and what kinds of strategies\nand APIs we are going to use, in order\nto implement user interactions that run smooth as butter.\nFrom there, we can look at transitions.\nTransitions as the easiest way to animate components\nin React Native.\nAnd we're going to build a component with two states.\nOne state-- the cards are overlaid on top of each other.\nSecond state-- they are nicely fanned out.\nAnd we are going to declare a transition\nto animate nicely from one state to the other.\nAnd then, we're going to build the simple timing animation\nthat we can loop, pause, resume, pause, resume, using Bare Metal\nanimation APIs.\nGetting to know these low level APIs\nwould be the key to success for us to harness\ngestures and animations in React Native.\nAnd then, it will be time to add gestures into the mix.\nAnd we are going to build this nice wallet user experience.\nSo we can swipe for cards nicely.\nAnd they animate very nicely depending on their position.\nFinally, I would like to show you\nwhat these gestures and animations integrate very\nnicely with SVG, and we're going to build\nthis really cool circular slider using gestures and SVG\nanimations.\nThis workshop will only be scratching\nthe surface of the exciting wall of gestures and animation\nin React Native.\nAnd to conclude, I would give you\nall the resources that I know of,\nin case you are interested to go further with this topic.\nIn the video description, you will find the GitHub repository\nwith all the code examples as well as the boilerplate files,\nin case you want to code along in the video.\nAnd also available in the video description\nare all the timestamps for each of the different chapters\nof the workshop.\nSo Free Code Campers, are you ready to discover\nthe powerful world of declarative gestures\nand animations in React Native?\nLet's get started.\n[UPBEAT MUSIC]\nWhen building gestures and animations, the key to success\nis to avoid frame drops.\nWe want the user interaction to run\nat 60 frames per second, which means that we only\nhave 16 milliseconds to compute everything.\nAnd this is a very simple diagram of the React\nNative architecture.\nWe have the JavaScript Thread, which runs the react code,\nand the UI Thread which interacts\nwith all the native components.\nAnd they talk to each other using\nwhat we call the async bridge.\nThey asynchronously send each other JSON messages.\nSo if your gesture or animation relies on communication\nbetween these two threads, it is very hard\nto guarantee that the animation frame can\nbe computed within 16 milliseconds,\nand you are likely to draw up frame.\nThere are a couple of reasons for that.\nFirst, because of these asynchronous messages\nthat needs to be passed and serialized,\nyou might drop a frame on the low end device,\nand the JavaScript Thread might be busy doing something else.\nFor instance, processing the response of an HTTP request.\nSo maybe you have a gesture.\nSo the UI Thread says to the JavaScript Thread,\nshould I grant the gesture?\nAnd the JavaScript Thread might be busy\nprocessing the response of an HTTP request.\nSo is not able to reply within these 16 milliseconds.\nAnd you're going to drop a frame,\nand the user experience is not going to feel very smooth.\nSo the way we are going to circumvent this problem\nis by declaring all of our gestures and animations\nbefore hand, which means that there\nis no communication between the JavaScript Thread and the UI\nThread.\nSo it doesn't matter if the JavaScript Thread is busy\ndoing something else, because the UI Thread is\ngoing to be able to do all the tasks he\nneeds to do for each frame.\nAnd plus, because there is no communication between the two\nThreads, we are sure that we are able to compute the animation\nframe within these 16 milliseconds.\nAnd I would like to show you an example\nof what this means concretely.\nSo here I am dragging around this component.\nAnd we implemented this example using the default gesture\nand animation API provided by React Native.\nI call it a vanilla animation APIs.\nAnd as you can see here, the gesture depends--\nrelies on communication between the JavaScript\nThread and the UI Thread.\nSo to grant as a gesture, we need to execute some JavaScript\nThread.\nWhen we move the view around here,\neverything is done on the--\nbecause we use these animated events,\neverything is done on the UI Thread.\nSo there is no communication between the JavaScript\nand the Native side.\nAnd when we reduce the gesture, we also\nrely on JavaScript code.\nAnd so because we have this mix of imperative code\nand declarative code, if the JavaScript Thread is busy,\nthis user interaction is not going to run smoothly.\nAnd in fact, what I can do is to modify the code,\nso that we observe JavaScript Thread--\nwe make the JavaScript Thread busy.\nSo I'm going to loop 5,000 time and maybe\nlike print something like [? JS ?] Thread busy.\nAnd now, you see I cannot move the ball around\nbecause the JavaScript Thread is busy.\nAnd so we are not going to use these APIs,\nbecause these APIs rely on communication\nbetween the UI Thread and the JavaScript Thread.\nAnd what we're going to use instead\nis two libraries, React Native Reanimated for animations\nand React Native Gesture Handler for gestures.\nAnd what these libraries do is that they\nenable you to implement all of the gestures and animations\ndeclaratively on the UI Thread, which\nmeans that when you have your gesture and animation running,\nthere is no communication between the two Threads\nthat is involved.\nSo here, if I make the JavaScript Thread busy,\nit doesn't matter because there are\nno communications between the UI Thread and the JavaScript\nThread.\nSo this is the same implementation\nbut using declarative gestures and animations\nusing React Native Gesture Handler and React Native\nReanimated.\nAnd now, so everything is done declaratively.\nAnd now I can make the JavaScript Thread busy.\nSo [? JS ?] Thread busy.\nSo now the loop is running, but because I\ndon't rely on the JavaScript Thread,\nyou see I can still move the ball around the smoothly.\nAnd so this is the heart of the matter declaring\nall the gestures and animations before.\nAnd this will guarantee us to build\nuser experiences that will run at 60 FPS even on low end\ndevices.\n[UPBEAT MUSIC]\nIn this example, I would like to show\nyou the power of transitions in React Native.\nTransitions are the easiest way to animate components\nin React Native, and the way it works\nis that we can attach an animation value to a change\nof state in a component.\nSo here, I have a very simple component\nwith a very simple state, toggled is true or false.\nIf the toggle is true, we apply here\na rotation, which is index minus 1 times alpha.\nSo alpha is [? 30 ?] degrees.\nPi is 180 degrees divided by 6.\nAnd here I do index minus 1, minus 1 times alpha.\nSo if index is 0, 0 minus 1 is minus 1 times [? 30 ?] degrees.\nSo we'll have a minus [? 30 ?] degrees.\nIf index is 1, so the count in the middle,\nwe would have 1 minus 1, 0 times [? 30 ?] degrees, 0.\nSo there won't be any rotation.\nIf it's the [? third ?] card, we will have index [? 2 ?]\n[? to ?] minus 1 is 1.\nSo we'll have [? 30 ?] degrees.\nSo we see here.\nHere we have the cards constants,\nwhich contains six cards.\nWe select 3.\nAnd we calculate the rotation.\nWhen pressing this button, we toggle the state--\nso to its opposite value.\nAnd so if toggled is false, we have a rotation of 0.\nAnd what we can do here is to use\na hook called useTransition.\nThat will give us an animation value that will go from 0 to 1\nwhen toggled changes.\nSo if toggled is false, the animation value will be 0.\nIf toggled is 1, the animation value will be 1.\nAnd the way the transition from 0 to 1, 1 to 0 [? goes ?]\ncan be a timing function, can be a spring function,\nand can be any configuration of the animation functions\nthat you want.\nSo let's get this animation value.\nHere we're going to call it transition.\nAnd we're going to use a function called useTransition.\nuseTransition comes from a package\ncalled react-native-redash.\nSo we are going to use react-native-reanimated\nand React Native Gesture Handler for the declarative gestures\nand animations.\nAnd I created an open source package\ncalled react-native-redash.\nI see it as being the [INAUDIBLE] of Reanimated that\nprovides us with a lot of utility functions,\nsuch as this useTransition hook.\nBut you don't have to be intimidated by [? it. ?]\nThese are just helper functions on top of Reanimated\nand Gesture Handler.\nYou can look at the source code of some of these functions\nto see how it works behind the scene.\nBut these are usually very simple helper functions.\nSo this function takes two arguments.\nThe first is the state we want to transition on.\nAnd here it's toggled.\nAnd then we can pass an animation configuration.\nSo for instance, by default, useTransition\nis using a timing function.\nAnd maybe I want the duration to be [INAUDIBLE]..\nYou can set some easing.\nYou can have a spring function instead.\nSo here we have our transition.\nAnd what we want to do is to interpolate the rotation\nbased on the transition.\nSo here, you see we have the View component.\nHere we use Animated.View.\nAnimated.View is an animation wrapper around view\nso that in these style properties\nwe can use animation values.\nSo here we pass a string, which is a rotation value in radians.\nBut now because we use Animated.View,\nthis style property can also accept animation values.\nSo here, rotate is going to become an animation value.\nAnd we are going to interpolate it using transition.\nSo we can write it using interpolate\nfrom react-native-reanimated.\nSo the animation value is [? a ?] transition.\nInput range is 0, 1.\nAnd output range is if toggled is 0, the rotation is 0.\nIf toggled is 1, the rotation is index minus 1 times alpha.\nSo I need to import interpolate.\nLet's have a look.\nSo you see here it nicely transitions from one state\nto the other.\nIt looks very cool.\nAgain, speaking of helper functions in redash,\nwe are going to have a lot of these animation values\nthat go from 0 to 1.\nAnd we're going to interpolate always from 0 to 1.\nThere is a helper function called mix in redash.\nSo here we import mix from redash.\nAnd it's the same implementation as mix\nin [? OpenGL. ?] So we can pass directly\nthe output range like this.\nSo from 0 to index minus 1 times alpha.\nSo just a nice shortcut.\nAnd here it is.\nAnd the last thing we can do is to change\nthe transformation of origin.\nSo here you see by default is the center of the card.\nAnd the way we transform the origin in react-native using\nthe transform API is that we are going to translate to where--\nso from the center of origin to where we want the new origin\nto be, do the transformation.\nAnd translate back.\nSo, here we want to translate so the default origin is\nhalf of the width of the card, half of the height of the card.\nWe want to translate to minus half of the width of the card.\nDo the transformation.\nTranslate back to half of the width of the card.\nSo we're going to write translate x is\nminus card width divided by 2.\nWe do the transformation, which is rotate.\nAnd translate back.\nSo translate x is card width divided by 2.\nAnd so here you see it nicely changes\nthe transformation of origin.\nAnd here again, we have a nice utility function in Redash\nto perform such a transformation of origin.\nAnd it's called transform origin.\nAnd the first parameter is the new transformation origin.\nSo here we have x, which is minus card divided by 2.\nY is 0.\nWe don't change it.\nAnd the transformation is rotate.\nAnd so here it is.\nSo transitions are a great way to animate components\nin react-native with little to zero knowledge of gestures\nand animations.\nSo just a great way to animate changes in your component\nstates.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nIn this example, we are going to build a simple timing function\nusing some bare metal APIs from Reanimated,\nand getting to know these low level APIs\nwill enable us to build incredible user experiences.\nSo here, I have a chat bubble component\nthat takes a progress property, which goes from 0 to 1.\nSo this is the state at 0.\nWe can look at the state at 0.5, 1.\nAnd so we're going to go from 0 to 1, 1 to 0.\nAnd there is a state play, which is true or false.\nSo we want this looping timing function\nto be pausable and resumable nicely.\nAnd in order to implement this timing function,\nwe are going to use all the concepts\nthat react-native-reanimated has to offer, or almost all\nof the concepts.\nAnd one of these concepts are clocks.\nSo clocks are animation values which\nupdate themselves across time.\nSo by default, the value of a clock is 0.\nYou can invoke a function called start clock on it.\nAnd every frame, the clock animation value\nwill update itself with a timestamp.\nAnd this will enable us to build animations across time.\nThen there is a stop clock function to stop the clock.\nSo the clock animation value will stop updating itself.\nAnd there is a function called clock\nrunning to check if the clock is running or not.\nAnd so the way you can create a clock is like this.\nSo it's clock from Reanimated.\nWe want here because we're going to have many [? re-renders ?]\nwhen the state changes.\nWe don't want to recreate a new clock every time.\nWe want the clock identity to match\nthe lifecycle of the component.\nSo we want to always have the same clock for every instance\nof our timing component.\nAnd so we can use a helper function for that.\nAgain, from Redash, which is useClock.\nAnd here for progress we can use an animation value.\nSo you would do new value [? is 0 ?] from again,\nReact Native Reanimated.\nBut we also want the identity to be preserved across\n[? re-renders. ?] So we're going to use useValue from Redash.\nAnd these are simple wrappers using [? a lazy ?] [? useRef ?]\nto have--\nsorry.\nI need to import from Redash.\nSo what we are going to do is that we're\ngoing to use a hook called useCode, which\nallows us to declare animation nodes to be\nrun for every frame on the UI Thread.\nSo the function signature-- the hook signature-- is very\nsimilar to use [? effect. ?]\nThe first argument is a callback that returns here\nan array of animation node.\nThe second parameter are the dependencies.\nHere we have none.\nWe want these animation nodes to have also the same lifecycle\n[INAUDIBLE] timing component.\nAnd so what we're going to do is use the clock\nto control the animation.\nIf the clock is not running, the animation is paused.\nIf the clock is running, the animation is running.\nAnd so by default, here, we're going\nto want the animation to run.\nSo we're going to use startClock.\nAnd what we're going to do is assign to the progress value\nsome timing function.\nSo some function that we are going\nto call runTiming and pass the clock as parameter.\nSo let's create it here.\nSo runTiming is a function that receives a clock as parameter.\nAnd we're going to return some progress value.\nExecute also a bunch of animation nodes.\nSo you can use block in order to do that.\nTakes an array of animation nodes as parameter\nand will execute these animation nodes sequentially.\nSo maybe I return 0.\nSo the last node in the array's value [? that is ?] returned.\nAnd so you know-- you see here I'm\nnot writing progress equals runTiming.\nBecause these are not imperative instructions\nthat are run on the JavaScript Thread,\nbut declarative animation nodes to be\nexecuted on the UI Thread.\nSo this is-- here it's not a code that is executed,\nbut it's a declaration for code to be\nexecuted on the UI Thread.\nSo we're not going to use the if else syntax from JavaScript.\nWe are going to use the condition animation node.\nWe're not going to use equal, but set animation node.\nAnd so on.\nSo Reanimated provides us with all the animation nodes\nwe need in order to declare complex animation states\nand interactions on the UI Thread.\nSo lets write our runTiming function.\nSo I need to import this one from Reanimated.\nSo if we look at the timing function from\nreact-native-reanimated, we see that it takes three\nparameters-- the clock, so to you know, see where--\nhow we evolved across time, the animation state.\nSo finished position.\n[INAUDIBLE] position will be from 0 to 1, right?\nTime, and frame time. [? So ?] [INAUDIBLE]\nlast clock values for the last evaluation and 0 to 1\nif the animation is finished or not.\nAnd then the animation configuration.\nSo the target value duration easing.\nSo you see, if you are familiar to the vanilla animated\nAPI from React Native, it's a bit more complex to execute\na simple timing function.\nBut this-- so the barrier to entry is higher,\nbut this is way more powerful functions.\nSo this is why I really want us to look at the low level of how\nthese functions work.\nBecause this will enable us, down the road, to go much,\nmuch further.\nBecause these functions are incredibly powerful.\nSo let me copy paste here, the function.\nSo timing from React Native Reanimated.\nAnd so the clock we get as parameter.\nLet's create the state.\nSo I'm going to create it here.\nState.\nSo I'm going to assign an animation value for each state.\nPosition, frame time, time.\nAnd we have the config.\nSo toValue, we're going to update it,\ndepending-- toValue is if the position is 0,\nthe position is going to be our starting value.\nIf the starting value is 0, the destination value is 1.\nAnd if the position is 1, the destination value\nis going to be 0.\nDuration, I don't know.\nLet's put 3 seconds.\nAnd easing we can put whatever, I think.\nIn, out.\nAnd it does not like the configuration.\nSo I have [? how ?] is the syntax of the easing.\nHere I'm importing easing from vanilla react-native.\nBut I need to import the one from Reanimated.\nSo that should be good.\nThis is where [INAUDIBLE] [? script ?] is so useful.\nSo here we execute the timing function for every frame.\nAnd what we want to return is the position.\nSo state.position.\nSo we see it animates nicely from 0 to 1.\nAt 1, nothing happens.\nSo at 1, what we need to do--\nso if state.finish equals 1--\nso you see here, we are not [? write-- ?] again,\nwe are not writing if else, because this is not just code\nthat is executed imperatively.\nThis is a declaration.\nSo we use a condition animation node.\nThat is a declaration to run on the UI Thread.\nSo if the state of the animation is finished,\nwe want to reset these animation values.\nPosition we will leave.\nBut we need to update the [? toValue. ?]\nSo let me reset the state.\nSo is finished is 0.\nWe want to loop.\nFrameTime time we reset as well.\nBecause we are restarting the animation.\nPosition we keep.\nIf it's 1, it's still 1.\nWe want to continue where we were.\nSo state.time.\nBut what we want to change is the destination value.\nSo config toValue is going to be the opposite of state.position.\nIf position is 0, the [? toValue ?] is 1.\nIf position is 1, the [? toValue ?] is 0.\nSo here I need to import these nodes.\nSo you see it loops nicely from 1 to 0 and now from 0 to 1.\nNow let's make the animation interruptible.\nSo you see here, you might be under the impression\nthat this is a lot of boilerplate code\nto write a simple looping animation.\nThere are utility animation functions in Redash\nthat allows you to do these in a few lines of code.\nBecause all this boilerplate can be done for you.\nBut I find it to be extremely important to understand\nhow these clocks and animation evaluation work.\nBecause this can really unlock the power\nof complex declarative gestures and animations\nas we run at 60 FPS.\nSo this is why here we are doing all the boilerplate manually.\nSo here we have the state play which becomes true or false.\nAnd the first thing I want to do is\nto have an animation value that matches the state of play.\nSo if play is true, I want my animation value to be 1.\nIf play is false, my animation value to be 0.\nSo here, we're going to create an animation\nvalue called isPlaying.\nSo default value is 0.\n[INAUDIBLE] default state is false.\nSo that's good.\nAnd we're going to create a hook.\nAgain, a useCode hook.\nThat we set the animation value isPlaying\nto match the state of the play variable.\nAnd you see here, I could write it here, in useCode.\nBut I'm having different dependencies now.\nSo let me show you.\nSo I do isPlaying.\nSo if play is true it's 1.\nIf not, 0.\nAnd here the dependencies is play.\nSo when play changes, this instruction changes.\nBecause it depends on the play variable.\nAnd this is why I'm putting it into a separate useCode block.\nBecause I don't want to have a dependency on the play variable\nhere.\nWhat I'm going to write the instructions--\nI'm going to declare here are valid for the whole lifetime\nof the component.\nSo I don't want to recreate these animation\nnodes if the play variable has changed, only isPlaying.\nSo now, we should have the isPlaying variable that matches\nthe state of the component.\nAnd so we're going to [INAUDIBLE] actually.\nSo we're going to write two conditions.\nSo the first condition is if the state of the animation\nis playing and the clock is not running.\nSo not clockRunning.\nAnd here you see you have to count the parentheses.\nWe want to start the clock.\nWe want to start the animation.\nAnd the other way around.\nIf the animation is not playing, and the clock is running,\nwe want to stop the clock.\nSo I need to import stopClock and [? the and. ?]\nLet's have a look.\nSo [INAUDIBLE] play.\nAnd I can pause.\nResume.\nAnd you see, it doesn't resume at the proper state.\nBut I can pause.\nAnd I can start the animation.\nBut when I restart the animation,\nthe state of the animation is screwed up, pardon my French.\nSo here if the clock is not running.\nSo if we pause the animation, we want\nto reset the time variable of the state,\nso that when it resumes, it resumes the animation properly.\nAnd if not, we run the timing function.\nSo let's pause.\nAnd now it resumes exactly where it was [? paused. ?] Super.\nAnd it loops nicely.\nSo a really cool timing function [? that-- ?] so, very low\nlevel APIs, clocks and all these complex animation states.\nBut these are really--\nthese low level primitives are really worth it\nin order to build complex user interactions.\nAnd we've seen how we don't write imperative JavaScript\ncode, but [INAUDIBLE] animation nodes,\nwhich are declarations on the UI Thread.\nAnd so all the primitives we have in JavaScript, if,\nand, not--\nwe can-- the semicolon to have sequential instructions.\nSo we have the block here.\nSo we have an equivalent for all the JavaScript\nconstructs as animation nodes.\nAnd the only construct that is--\nso you can have variable assignments, sequentials,\nexecutions, conditional nodes.\nThe only primitive that is not available are loops.\nBut here-- but that's OK.\nBecause here it's [? code ?] to be evaluated for every frame.\nSo I hope you enjoyed this example.\nIf this makes sense to you, then you really\nhave unlocked the power of declarative gestures\nand animations.\nIf you are able to switch from the imperative mindset\nto the declarative mindset, and understand\nhow you can use clocks and animation states in order\nto build different user interactions,\nthen the world of animations and gestures in React Native\nis your oyster.\nI think you can really go very far with these primitives.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nSo we have looked at transitions, animations.\nNow let us play around with gestures.\nWe have a bunch of cards here.\nAnd let's assign some gesture handler to these cards.\nAnd play around, see what we can do.\nAnd so here I am looping over all my cards.\nAnd maybe what I can do here is wrap\na PanGestureHandler from React Native Gesture Handler.\nSo we can maybe move these cards around.\nAnd we need to pass two properties for the gesture\nhandler to work.\nAnd we're going to use again [INAUDIBLE]..\nSo it's quite some boilerplate.\nThere is a lot of animation values\nto be created [? to ?] properties to be\nassigned in PanGestureHandler.\nSo we are going to use utility function, again from Redash\nin order to have all this boilerplate done for us.\nBut you know, again, don't be intimidated.\nYou can look at the Redash source code\nor at the react-native gesture handler source code\nto see what kind of boilerplate is required for these gesture\nhandlers to work.\nBut we're going to get the gesture handler from a function\ncalled usePanGestureHandler.\nAnd it gives us a couple of variables, a gesture handler\nthat we can assign here.\nAnd the translation vector of the card, the velocity.\nSo when we release the gesture--\n[INAUDIBLE] velocity of the gesture,\nand the state of the gesture.\nIs the gesture active?\nIs the gesture [INAUDIBLE] and--\nso here we assign the PanGestureHandler.\nI probably need to move key here.\nAnd the PanGestureHandler takes a single [? children ?]\nwhich needs to be an Animated.View from Reanimated.\nSo here we use Animated.View from react-native-reanimated.\nSo we get the translation vector here.\nI think we can assign it to this transformation\nto see if we can move the card around.\nSo we're going to use a transform.\nAnd there is a utility function in Redash called translate\nwhere we can give it a vector.\nAnd it will apply translate x, translate y.\nA simple shortcut.\nSo here I can move the cards around.\nBut I should create one PanGestureHandler\nfor each gesture handler.\nSo I'm just going to move it here.\nAh-ha.\nSo you see I can move the card.\nBut now if I start the gesture again,\nit starts from the original position.\nSo we need to save the position in an offset value\nwhen the gesture ends.\nAnd again in Redash, we have a utility function for that.\nSo I'm going to create translate x equals withOffset.\nAnd the first parameter is animation value.\nAnd the second parameter is the state of the gesture.\nSo that we know when to save the offset.\nSo translate x.\nWe're going to do the same for y.\nAnd here we're going to apply the transform.\nSo translate x.\nTranslate y.\nIt's translation.\nSo here I can move the card around.\nAnd it remembers its position across time.\nAnd you see, when I stop the gesture, it's kind of abrupt.\nThere is no like physical momentum.\nSo what we can do here instead of using withOffset,\nwe can use withDecay, which will add some nice decay.\nAnd this is where the velocity comes into play.\nBecause the decay is calculated according to the velocity.\nSo value is translation x.\nVelocity is velocity dot--\noops.\nvelocity.x.\nState is [? the ?] state.\nSo same for y.\nSo now you see you have this nice momentum when\nmoving the card.\nAnd you see it is interruptable as well.\nSo now let's have a nice wallet animation using these concepts\nof PanGestureHandler and decay.\nSo I'm going to move this outside the loop.\nAnd we're going to move the PanGestureHandler to be\nunique to [INAUDIBLE] [? view. ?]\nAnd we want to translate only on the x-axis, actually.\nSo we just want to scroll.\nOops.\nWe just want to nicely scroll [? our ?] cards.\nSo something is not working.\nBecause we forgot, as I mentioned,\nthe single child needs to be an animated [INAUDIBLE]..\nBut what I'm going to do, because I\nwant to keep this one, I think I'm going to wrap it here.\nAnd put an Animated.View.\nLet's see how it looks.\n[LAUGHING] It's not translate x, but translate y.\nOK.\nSo it translates nicely.\nAnd we have the nice momentum effect from decay.\nSo now we want to clamp the values.\nWe're going to use a function called diffClamp.\nSo it clamps-- diffClamp clamps of value with a min max.\nBut we call it diffClamp, meaning that, you know,\nif we go to minus [? 100 ?] pixels,\njust a delta of one pixel will be taken into account.\nSo it's much more responsive if you want--\nif you scrolled far back in one of the lower or upper bound\nand want to go back to one of the--\nwithin the bounds of the [INAUDIBLE] clamping.\nSo we're going to add diffClamp here.\nAnd here there is a trick.\nSo there's currently a bug in the diffClamp implementation\nof Reanimated.\nSo we're going to use diffClamp from Redash.\nSo in order to not have this bug.\nSo the maximum value is 0.\nRight.\nWhen we are at this state here.\nAnd the minimum value is going to be so--\nthe length-- so the height of all these cards\nminus this height here.\nSo this would be minus cards.length times card height,\nwhich we have defined here, perfect--\nminus the container height, which\nwe calculate using onLayout.\nSo let's have a look.\nSo here, so you see this is where diffClamp comes in.\nIf I use only clamps, so here I'm\nscrolling, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.\nThen if I want to scroll back like this,\nI would have to do all the opposite scrolling that I did.\nBut even [INAUDIBLE] maybe I'm like 500 pixels right now.\nI can just immediately go back up.\nAnd this is what diffClamp does.\nI mean, I can show you quickly with clamp.\nSo I'm here I'm scrolling down, scrolling down, scrolling down,\nscrolling down, scrolling down.\nIf I want to scroll up again, I need\nto scroll up, scroll up, scroll up, scroll up, scroll up.\nAnd now it scrolls up.\nWith diffClamps, it's going to be automatic.\nScroll down, scroll down, scroll down.\nBut you see immediately scroll up.\nAnd let's look.\nSo the lower bound is not correct.\nIt's plus container height.\nSorry.\nSo 0 and perfect.\nAnd very cool.\nSo now let's animate our cards.\nSo maybe we want to add--\nso we want, actually, now--\nwe're going to clamp.\nSo I'm going to call this y.\nSo if the card has reached the top,\nI don't want it to go above.\nI want to clamp its value.\nSo translate y.\nWe're going to interpolate from the y animation value.\nSo the input range goes from 0 and if we translate to--\nso for the card to be at the top, if it's 0, it's 0.\nIf it's-- minus card width, so that would be minus card--\nso card height, sorry--\ntimes index.\nSo this would be our clamping value.\nSo the output range would be the same value.\nBut we're going to use extrapolate clamp, meaning--\nso this should be the maximum value the card can go.\nSo do not go outside the screen.\nAnd so by using--\nso here we use linear interpolation. [? These ?]\nvalues match one to one.\nBut when we have a value, for instance,\nthat is lower than minus card height times index,\nwe want to be at minus card height times\nindex, not a lower value.\nSo we are going to write extrapolate--\nextrapolate.clamp.\nLet's have a look.\nSo we see the card moves on top of each other.\nYou can even add, maybe, just, you know,\nif you want to build some effects, here.\nMaybe it's minus card height plus 16.\nOr minus 16, sorry.\nYou [? see here-- ?] 24 [INAUDIBLE]..\nSo you already have here a nice wallet animation.\nSo now we want to calculate the position of each card.\nAnd so the position y is y plus the index times card height.\nAnd we're going to use this value\nto do a couple of interpolations.\nSo if the card is disappearing, its position\nis at least minus height.\nSo from minus 0 to minus height.\nMinus card height.\nSorry.\nRight.\nSo here, the card, its position is 0.\nSo if the card is on top, its position is 0.\nIf the card is at the bottom here--\nso what is the position on bottom?\nIt's the number of visible cards in the screen\ntimes the height of the card.\nSo that would be visible cards times card height.\nWhat are the number of visible cards?\nSo visible cards-- we do a math floor of the container\nheight divided by card height.\nAnd so this is the number of visible cards.\nSo this is-- so minus 1 for the range\nand is appearing is the number of visible cards times card\nheight.\nSo is bottom, is appearing.\nSo now we can create some scale transformation.\nSo the scale of the card--\nso we interpolate from position y.\nSo the input range is disappearing is on top,\nis on bottom, and is appearing.\nAnd the animation values are--\nso 0, 5, it's disappearing.\n1, 1 if it's in the visible range.\nAnd 0, 5, when it's appearing.\nLet's try that.\nSo here you see it disappears nicely in the background.\nAnd it appears nicely here.\nWhat we can do is add some clamping.\nThat looks good.\nLet's add some opacity.\nSo same story for opacity.\nSo I can just add it here.\nAnd here, 1-- oh, actually, the same value.\nNo.\nWhat we want to do here is to not clamp, I think.\nSo we see here it disappears nicely.\nAnd so one thing we can fix is, you see when the card appears,\nit's too far away from the top card.\nIt's not super smooth.\nSo we can add some extra translation here.\nSo here we can add.\nSo you see here, we don't do a plus.\nAgain, we use [INAUDIBLE] [? add ?] animation node.\nSo let's call it extra translation y.\nSo which we're going to interpolate from position y.\nSo actually let me move these up.\nSo we interpolate from position y.\nOops.\nSo input range.\nSo we go from isOnBottom on bottom to isAppearing.\nOutput range.\nSo at bottom, the translation is 0.\nAt isAppearing, we know that at isAppearing, the size is--\nscale 0, 5.\nSo the height is card height divided by 2.\nAnd we want to move it by half of the card height.\nSo it's going to be card height divided by 4.\nAnd of course, here we want to clamp.\nSo we don't want to go outside these values.\nExtrapolate clamp.\nLet's have a look.\nNo.\nIt's not.\nIt's minus card height divided by 4.\nAnd you see now it looks very cool.\nAnd one thing we can do here [INAUDIBLE]\nthe scroll is not completely over.\nSo we don't want to stop the scroll on--\nI'm being very picky here.\nBut it doesn't feel nice that the end scroll\nposition is this.\nSo the last card should be at least as the full position.\nSo here, maybe instead of container,\nwe can do visible cards.\nNow what do we need to do?\nSo we container height.\nLet's try visible cards times card height.\nYes.\nSo that looks good.\nSo here our end scroll position looks much nicer.\nSo you see a pretty cool user interaction\nusing the PanGestureHandler from react-native GestureHandler.\nBut there of course are tons of different user interactions\nyou can build using these APIs.\nBut I hope that this nice [INAUDIBLE] user interactions\nreally gave you some inspiration on the kind of gestures\nand animations you can build using these APIs.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nThese gestures and animations we just looked at\nintegrate seamlessly with react-native-svg.\nAnd this allows for an interesting range\nof fun and creative user experiences and components.\nAnd this is thanks to an incredible community\nand open source work.\nRight?\nSo we looked at react-native gesture handler,\nreact-native-reanimated, which allows\nus to declare our animations on the UI Thread.\nAnd then there has been a tremendous amount\nof open source and community work which\nhas been spent in order for these libraries\nto nicely integrate with react-native-svg.\nAnd so I would like to show you a simple example, which is\ngoing to be a circular slider.\nSo here we have a svg circle.\nHere the circular progress.\nAnd so we have the white one here.\nAnd we're going to animate the stroke of this one\nto show some progress.\nAnd here we have a cursor component,\nwhich we are going to be able to move around.\nAnd its value will always fit the bounds of the circle.\nSo here we have a theta animation value.\nAnd we are going to move the cursor around\nto update this value.\nSo theta goes from 0.\nThis is the position at 0.\nOr actually, here we have a rotate of minus 90 degrees.\nSo 0 is going to be here.\nLet me remove this one for now.\nSo we're going to have 0 here.\nWe move pi minus pi 0.\nAnd so maybe here we're going to normalize.\nBecause this goes from 0 to pi minus pi 0.\nWe're going to normalize it to go from 0 to 2 pi.\n360 degrees.\nAnd the way we're going to do it--\nwe are going to set--\nso we have a theta value, 0.\nThis will set the position of the cursor on to the circle.\nHow are we going to do it?\nWell, we have three coordinate systems\nto work with in react-native.\nThere is a [INAUDIBLE] coordinate system.\nSo there is an x-axis which goes from the left to right,\nand the y-axis, which goes from top to bottom.\nThis is [INAUDIBLE] coordinate system.\nThen there is a Cartesian coordinate system,\nwhere we have a center of origin somewhere.\nHere our center is going to be the middle of the circle.\nAnd the y-axis goes from 0 from bottom to top.\nSo the opposite of the [INAUDIBLE]\naxis, which goes from top to bottom.\nAnd then we have the x-axis, which is identical.\nIt goes from left to right.\nThis is our Cartesian coordinate system.\nThe third coordinate system is a polar coordinate system.\nSo here we also have an origin.\nAnd given an x and y value in the Cartesian coordinate\nsystem, we are going to get an angle in a theta value\nin radians and a radius.\nSo we take the angle.\nWe convert it to the-- so we have a polar coordinate.\nSo we have a radius and an angle.\nWe can convert it to a [INAUDIBLE] coordinate,\nwhich would give us x and y positions [INAUDIBLE]..\nSo that will position the cursor on to the circle.\nThen we move the circle around.\nSo we have an x and y-coordinate which\nwe can transform to a polar coordinate\nin order to know the angle theta.\nAnd so we can assign the theta value,\nwhich will drive the animations of the stroke value.\nAnd also maybe we can animate the color of the progress.\nSo maybe you want green at the beginning, red at the end.\nAnd so if you go on my YouTube channel,\nI will put the links in the video description.\nI have videos on how we can convert from one coordinate\nsystem to the other.\nHere we're going to use again utility functions from Redash\nto seamlessly go from one to the other.\nSo let's get started.\nSo we are going to start with our cursor.\nAnd once we have--\nso the cursor is going to [? write ?] the data value.\nAnd once we have it working, we will look into animate\nthe circular progress component that we have here.\nSo let's look at the cursor.\nSo the first thing we're going to do\nis to wrap a PanGestureHandler so we can move it around.\nSo PanGestureHandler from react-native gesture handler.\nAnd we need the gesture handler.\nWe're going to use the helper function from Redash.\nSo we have gesture handler.\nusePanGestureHandler.\nAnd we're going to get a translation vector\nand the state of the gesture.\nOops.\nSome [? typo ?] here.\nAnd so here we're going to add some translate.\nBut what-- so what we want to do--\nOK.\nLet's add some translate.\nSo translate x, we're going to use--\nso we want to remember the position\nacross different gestures.\nSo we're going to use withOffset.\nSo translate x state and translate y.\nTranslate y.\n[INAUDIBLE] translation.\nLet me apply the transformation.\nTranslate x.\nTranslate y.\nSo I can move the cursor around.\nSuper.\nBut now it needs to be, you know,\nwhatever is the position within the bounds of the circle.\nSo this is where we need to convert these values\ninto polar coordinates.\nSo I'm going to create x, y.\nAnd we have a center vector, which\nis the middle of the screen.\nSo let me create a vector.\nSo center is x is width divided by 2. y is height\ndivided by 2, which we need to import from the dimensions API.\nSo we have width, height from dimension get window.\nSo let's convert these into polar coordinates.\nSo we have polar equals--\nso these are Cartesian.\nSo we're going to use Cartesian to polar.\nThe math behind this function is super interesting.\nI have some videos on this topic.\nSo if you're interested, I definitely\nrecommend you check it out.\nThe first argument is a point.\nSo we have x, y.\nAnd we probably need to [INAUDIBLE] polar--\nno, Cartesian to polar.\nThat's correct.\nAnd so we get the theta angle, which we can\nassign to this animation value.\nThe radius-- here the radius doesn't matter.\nWhat we need to do is to set the radius\nto be the radius of our circle and convert back\nthese coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.\nSo we are going to have x translate x, y translate y.\nSo we are going to convert polar to Cartesian.\nTheta is polar.theta.\ntheta.\nNo problem.\nBut radius is not the radius of our cursor,\nbut the radius of the circle.\nSo that will bound the cursor to only move around the circle.\nAnd the second parameter should be\npolar to coordinate to Cartesian.\nIt looks good.\nIs this radius-- radius [INAUDIBLE]..\nSo you see we have an issue.\nSo translate x with the center.\nThe origin of-- so I think I should set center here.\nSorry.\nOK.\nIt's not Cartesian to polar.\nBut [INAUDIBLE] to polar.\nMy mistake.\nSo [INAUDIBLE] to polar.\nAnd we can set the center [? of ?] origin here.\nSo the center.\nAnd here it's convert to polar to [INAUDIBLE]..\nI was confused why it didn't need\nto use the center of origin--\nthe origin-- that didn't make any sense.\nSo now still actually, it doesn't work.\nWe have a weird--\nso actually here, it's the center because it's not--\nthe container, so it's not the window,\nbut the content, which is the size here of this container,\nof the circle [INAUDIBLE] I put background color red.\nSo you see our center is not height\nof the screen divided by 2, but radius and the radius.\nSo let me update this.\nSo center is radius.\nAnd so now it animates nicely.\nSo now we need to set the theta value.\nAnd so you could set the value to be polar.theta directly.\nBut polar.theta goes from 0 to pi and minus pi to minus 0.\nSo here the value would be minus pi divided by 2.\nAnd not 3/4 of 2 pi.\nSo we want to normalize the value to go from 0 to 2 pi.\nSo we're going to create useCode and we're\ngoing to assign [INAUDIBLE] and we're\ngoing to assign theta to be polar dot theta.\nBut we need to normalize theta.\nSo normalize theta.\nOr we take theta--\nso as an animated node.\nSo if theta is less than 0, so it's minus 0 minus pi,\nwe need to add 2 pi.\nSo theta is less than 0.\nIt's theta plus 2 pi.\nIf not, it's the theta value.\nSo from 0 to pi theta is OK.\nAnd now if let's say we have minus pi minus pi plus 2 pi,\nwould be 2 pi 3/4 of 2 pi.\nSo it's going to be 2 pi minus half of 1 pi.\nSo this should give us proper values for theta.\nAnd here, let's see.\nWe're going to interpolate the [? color ?] on theta\nto see what we get.\nSo let's use interpolate.\nSo colors are numbers.\nAnd we have a interpolate color function in Redash.\nSo we can interpolate on theta.\nAnd so input range--\nso theta goes from 0 to 2 pi.\nSo we have 0.\nLet's say pi and 2 pi.\nWe're going to use three colors.\nOutput range-- we can use style guide, palette, secondary,\nprimary, and primary.\nAnd tertiary.\nLet's have a look.\nSo we see here the color updates nicely.\nSo now let's animate our svg circle.\nAnd we're going to use a dash stroke array to animate\nthe progress of the circle.\nSo we want dash stroke array to be circumference of the circle.\nSo we want one empty stroke to be the circumference\nof the circle.\nOne full stroke to be the circumference of the circle--\nso we can animate, really, from 0\ncompletely empty to 1 completely full.\nSo the circumference of the circle\nis 2 pi times the radius.\nAnd the length of the arc of circle\nis going to be radius times the theta, right?\nAnd so this is going to be the offset--\nthe dash stroke offset.\nSo let's-- so we need to calculate the circumference.\nWhich is going to be 2 pi times the radius.\nWhich we get-- [INAUDIBLE] as property.\nSo we can assign dash stroke array to be--\nso circumference, circumference.\nAnd we can calculate the--\nso here, OK.\nSo it's dash stroke offset.\nAnd here-- so we're going to have\na couple of animation values.\nIt's not a circle, but an animated circle.\nAn animated circle.\nWe use create animated components\nin order to have the animated wrapper that can accept\nanimation values as property.\nSo now we need to calculate stroke dash offset.\nWhich is actually the same formula [INAUDIBLE] here.\nBut instead of having the full angle, which is 2 pi,\nwe use theta.\nSo it's going to be multiply theta by radius.\nLet's have a look.\nLooks good.\nBut also very strange.\nSo the stroke color appears to be good.\nBackground color.\nWe need to add stroke width.\nAnd now there is a strange offset value here.\nSo here it looks like at 0, it's correct.\nAnd then there is-- you see some offset value\nthat goes further and further.\nAnd I think here I wrote it down because I\nwrote radius is the radius minus the stroke width divided by 2.\nThat makes sense.\nBecause we want the center to be here.\nSo I should probably replace radius here.\nYeah.\nNow that looks good.\nIt's fun, isn't it?\nI could play with this always [INAUDIBLE]..\nBut really a nice example of how gestures and animations\nseamlessly integrate with each other.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nFree Code Campers, I hope you enjoyed this workshop\non declarative gestures and animations in react-native.\nLet me know what you think in the comments below.\nIf you're interested to go further with this topic,\nI will link to resources in the video description.\nWe discussed the heart of the matter.\nWhy is this topic so [INAUDIBLE] in React Native and the APIs\nand strategies to use in order to build these very smooth user\nexperiences.\nWe looked at transitions, the easiest way\nto animate react-native components.\nAnd then we implemented a simple timing function using\nthe bare metal reanimated API.\nAnd we've built this timing function to be interruptable,\nso we can pause, resume.\nBut also we can also loop the function across time.\nThen we built our first gesture.\nSo we had these cards and we could move them around\nand swipe them.\nAnd we've used the gesture API to build a nice wallet user\ninteraction.\nAnd finally, we've looked at how svg\ncan be used to seamlessly integrate with these gestures\nand animations.\nAnd that allows for a range of really fun and creative user\ninteractions to be built.\nIf you go on my YouTube channel, I\nhave dozens of videos on this topic.\nFor instance, in the case of the svg example,\nwe used functions which leverage trigonometry behind the scene,\nright, where we converted from polar coordinate system\nto [INAUDIBLE] and vice versa.\nI have videos where I really explain\nthe math behind the scene.\nAnd trigonometry is very important in animations,\nbecause as soon as you have something\nthat has some sort of rotation, it's\ngoing to involve trigonometry.\nAnd I have quite some videos about this topic.\nAnd I have also more advanced videos\non the topic of svg animation.\nFor instance, you can use svg animations\nto morph from one svg path to the other.\nAnd there is also really interesting examples\nwith Bezier curves.\nThat is really-- we only scratched the surface.\nThere is really tons of great things\nyou can build using svg animations.\nWe looked at the PanGestureHandler.\nBut there are, of course, different kinds\nof gestures in React Native--\nthe tap gesture handler, the pinch gesture handler,\nthe rotate gesture handler.\nAnd I also have videos on these topics.\nI will link to these resources in the video description.\nAnd we used the transform API to move things around.\nAnd we even did transformation of origin.\nThe transform API from react-native\nis incredibly powerful.\nAnd we've not even looked at all the things it has to offer.\nAnd I also have videos on this topic,\non how to build advanced 2D transformations,\nhow to save the state of complex transformations\nacross gestures.\nAnd I even have a video where we go to the third dimension.\nSo if you are interested, I hope that you will check it out.\nSo I'm really looking forward to talk to you soon.\nAnd in the meantime, happy hacking."

component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component from react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but with the\nwith the\nwith the version with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the so of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above the 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a gesture detector\ngesture detector\ngesture detector so uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh instead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin transfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth we can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture with the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component so uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate this view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view we are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated and in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we need to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture property\nproperty\nproperty so in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture property we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture right here\nright here\nright here so\nso\nso the default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version 2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler was to use the hook\nwas to use the hook\nwas to use the hook use animated\nuse animated\nuse animated use animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react natively animated\nnatively animated\nnatively animated so this one\nso this one\nso this one and here\nand here\nand here we can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks that we want to handle\nthat we want to handle\nthat we want to handle so instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach we can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component from the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler we can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan gesture\ngesture\ngesture and we can specify here\nand we can specify here\nand we can specify here all the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks so\nso\nso for instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation the default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active callback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update method\nmethod\nmethod so here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event and let's print\nand let's print\nand let's print the event translation x\nthe event translation x\nthe event translation x so of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this property to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector and let's reload\nso here\nso here you can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening you can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x values\nvalues\nvalues so\nso\nso in order to update\nin order to update\nin order to update this uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this translation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass the translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view so basically there are\nso basically there are\nso basically there are so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say minus different\nminus different\nminus different minus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two versions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler but what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is that right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on update callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler and not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated so this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between the previous approach but\nthe previous approach but\nthe previous approach but from the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that almost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing so here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to access the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex shared value\nshared value\nshared value and we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation x inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value and let's pass\nand let's pass\nand let's pass so let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value inside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated style\nstyle\nstyle so here let's return\nso here let's return\nso here let's return transform\ntransform\ntransform and let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex translatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value so if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this kind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and use animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my playlist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to reanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the video description of course\nvideo description of course\nvideo description of course so here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view and let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening so we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working nicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this animation\nanimation\nanimation you can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch so basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the translatex\ntranslatex\ntranslatex shared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and therefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping the previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart from the beginning\nfrom the beginning\nfrom the beginning so we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a second but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y so let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y shared value\nshared value\nshared value and let's save\nand let's save\nand let's save the event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here let's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style also the translate y value\nso let's reload\nso let's reload we can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y axis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis and if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same problem that we had before\nproblem that we had before\nproblem that we had before and in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need to store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state in um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object\nin um inside a

replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just create a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook basically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create a custom hook use\na custom hook use\na custom hook use called use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated

container style the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify content property\ncontent property\ncontent property and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this behavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to translate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen width but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value uh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value needs to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus 80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle so let's\nso let's\nso let's see what's going on\nsee what's going on\nsee what's going on and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly\nworking smoothly\nworking smoothly so let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80 let's define here the size equal to 80.\nsize here\nsize here and let's say\nand let's say\nand let's say size and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2. so uh\nso uh\nso uh of course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect uh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but you can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the animation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the width spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's because uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are not animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but we are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x parameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are are already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring animation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the translate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why so that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working nicely\nnicely\nnicely so thanks a lot for staying with me all\nso thanks a lot for staying with me all\nso thanks a lot for staying with me all the time i hope that you like this\nthe time i hope that you like this\nthe time i hope that you like this animation and you like this

in the description\ndescription\ndescription that said we can finally move on the\nthat said we can finally move on the\nthat said we can finally move on the code part\nso here i've created a react

so\nso\nso here you can see that i'm using the\nhere you can see that i'm using the\nhere you can see that i'm using the version 44 of the express decay\nversion 44 of the express decay\nversion 44 of

the type configuration\nscratch with the type configuration i've also installed the react native\ni've also installed the react native\ni've also installed the react native just handler package we will need a\njust handler package we will need a\njust handler package we will need a version above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we are going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package with a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0 version so in order to complete the reanimated\nso in order to complete the reanimated\nso in order to complete the reanimated installation installation\ninstallation installation\ninstallation installation don't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin in the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js so that said we can start\nso that said we can start\nso that said we can start to display our circle\nto display our circle\nto display our circle on the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see here styles.circle\nhere styles.circle\nhere styles.circle and let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style so we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to 80\n80\n80 a width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say aspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1 and background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say blue\nblue\nblue so since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify here the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and for design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the opacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8 so\nso\nso at this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to see how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture handler works\nhandler works\nhandler works so\nso\nso normally\nnormally\nnormally if we want to\nif we want to\nif we want to translate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen we use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component from react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but with the\nwith the\nwith the version with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the so of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above the 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a gesture detector\ngesture detector\ngesture detector so uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh instead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin transfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth we can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture with the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component so uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate this view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view we are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated and in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we need to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture property\nproperty\nproperty so in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture property we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture right here\nright here\nright here so\nso\nso the default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version 2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler was to use the hook\nwas to use the hook\nwas to use the hook use animated\nuse animated\nuse animated use animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react natively animated\nnatively animated\nnatively animated so this one\nso this one\nso this one and here\nand here\nand here we can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks that we want to handle\nthat we want to handle\nthat we want to handle so instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach we can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component from the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler we can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan gesture\ngesture\ngesture and we can specify here\nand we can specify here\nand we can specify here all the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks so\nso\nso for instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation the default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active callback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update method\nmethod\nmethod so here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event and let's print\nand let's print\nand let's print the event translation x\nthe event translation x\nthe event translation x so of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this property to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector and let's reload\nso here\nso here you can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening you can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x values\nvalues\nvalues so\nso\nso in order to update\nin order to update\nin order to update this uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this translation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass the translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view so basically there are\nso basically there are\nso basically there are so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say minus different\nminus different\nminus different minus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two versions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler but what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is that right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on update callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler and not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated so this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between the previous approach but\nthe previous approach but\nthe previous approach but from the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that almost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing so here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to access the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex shared value\nshared value\nshared value and we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation x inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value and let's pass\nand let's pass\nand let's pass so let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value inside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated style\nstyle\nstyle so here let's return\nso here let's return\nso here let's return transform\ntransform\ntransform and let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex translatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value so if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this kind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and use animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my playlist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to reanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the video description of course\nvideo description of course\nvideo description of course so here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view and let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening so we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working nicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this animation\nanimation\nanimation you can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch so basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the translatex\ntranslatex\ntranslatex shared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and therefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping the previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart from the beginning\nfrom the beginning\nfrom the beginning so we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a second but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y so let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y shared value\nshared value\nshared value and let's save\nand let's save\nand let's save the event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here let's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style also the translate y value\nso let's reload\nso let's reload we can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y axis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis and if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same problem that we had before\nproblem that we had before\nproblem that we had before and in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need to store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state in um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object in the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture handler we\nhandler we\nhandler we deal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the the context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each different codec\ndifferent codec\ndifferent codec so here normally we would have access to\nso here normally we would have access to\nso here normally we would have access to this context object\nthis context object\nthis context object but in the latest version we need to\nbut in the latest version we need to\nbut in the latest version we need to handle ourselves this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as a shared value\na shared value\na shared value so let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object and let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state so inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to save two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and a y value\na y value\na y value and we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous position on the start callback\nposition on the start callback\nposition on the start callback so here\nso here\nso here that's the syntax we are going to handle\nthat's the syntax we are going to handle\nthat's the syntax we are going to handle here the context\nhere the context\nhere the context so let's let's say that we want to store\nso let's let's say that we want to store\nso let's let's say that we want to store inside this context the current position\ninside this context the current position\ninside this context the current position so let's say x equal to translate x\nso let's say x equal to translate x\nso let's say x equal to translate x value and y equal to translate y value\nvalue and y equal to translate y value\nvalue and y equal to translate y value and let's keep here let's access\nand let's keep here let's access\nand let's keep here let's access here the context dot value\nhere the context dot value\nhere the context dot value dot x\ndot x\ndot x and this context dot value\nand this context dot value\nand this context dot value dot y\ndot y\ndot y so let's reload\nso let's reload\nso let's reload and you can see that everything is\nand you can see that everything is\nand you can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so um\nso um\nso um we are able to scroll everywhere this\nwe are able to scroll everywhere this\nwe are able to scroll everywhere this kind of circle\nkind of circle\nkind of circle but it isn't the animation that we want\nbut it isn't the animation that we want\nbut it isn't the animation that we want so we don't want that this circle\nso we don't want that this circle\nso we don't want that this circle follows perfectly\nfollows perfectly\nfollows perfectly our our finger but we want\nour our finger but we want\nour our finger but we want that it follows with the spring\nthat it follows with the spring\nthat it follows with the spring animation\nanimation\nanimation and in order to do it\nand in order to do it\nand in order to do it let's define here\nlet's define here\nlet's define here the\nthe\nthe so let's uh derive the follow x position\nso let's uh derive the follow x position\nso let's uh derive the follow x position so this follow x position will be our\nso this follow x position will be our\nso this follow x position will be our circle x position\ncircle x position\ncircle x position we are going to derive the circle x\nwe are going to derive the circle x\nwe are going to derive the circle x position from the translate x value\nposition from the translate x value\nposition from the translate x value and we are going to derive the follow y\nand we are going to derive the follow y\nand we are going to derive the follow y position from this translate y value\nposition from this translate y value\nposition from this translate y value so let's specify here follow x and\nso let's specify here follow x and\nso let's specify here follow x and follow y\nso of course uh here nothing is changing\nso of course uh here nothing is changing we are just uh refactoring a little bit\nwe are just uh refactoring a little bit\nwe are just uh refactoring a little bit this code\nthis code\nthis code so you can see that we are using of\nso you can see that we are using of\nso you can see that we are using of course use the right value from\ncourse use the right value from\ncourse use the right value from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated but since we want to follow it with a\nbut since we want to follow it with a\nbut since we want to follow it with a spring animation\nspring animation\nspring animation let's specify here the width spring\nlet's specify here the width spring\nlet's specify here the width spring high order function from a reanimated\nhigh order function from a reanimated\nhigh order function from a reanimated so with spring\nso with spring\nso with spring and let's see what's going on\nand let's see what's going on\nand let's see what's going on so you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect right here\nright here\nright here so um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to do\ndo\ndo we are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle and the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this translatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow this follow x value and the follow y value\nfollow x value and the follow y value\nfollow x value and the follow y value so basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow this\nthis\nthis blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle so we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and over this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order to avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just create a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook basically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create a custom hook use\na custom hook use\na custom hook use called use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated position so here we are going to access the\nso here we are going to access the\nso here we are going to access the position that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's say animated position\nsay animated position\nsay animated position of course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this animated position type\nanimated position type\nanimated position type so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say this animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x and a y shared value\nand a y shared value\nand a y shared value so we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance the translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate y value\ny value\ny value so let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value and y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated shared value\nshared value\nshared value of type number\nof type number\nof type number and here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y so we are just going to copy all this\nso we are just going to copy all this\nso we are just going to copy all this logic\nlogic\nlogic and let's paste right here\nand let's paste right here\nand let's paste right here so instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are going to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x and the y value\nand the y value\nand the y value so let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are going to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow y\ny\ny and the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style so let's\nso let's\nso let's remove this logic\nremove this logic\nremove this logic and let's just say\nand let's just say\nand let's just say use follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated position x will be equal to translate x\nequal to translate x\nequal to translate x and y will be equal to translate y\nand y will be equal to translate y\nand y will be equal to translate y and we are going to access follow x\nand we are going to access follow x\nand we are going to access follow x follow y and reanimated style\nfollow y and reanimated

nothing\nrefactored a little bit the code nothing\nrefactored a little bit the code nothing is changing um it's just for uh the sake\nis changing um it's just for uh the sake\nis changing um it's just for uh the sake of clarity so uh right now we are going\nof clarity so uh right now we are going\nof clarity so uh right now we are going to replicate this logic so wrapping it\nto replicate this logic so wrapping it\nto replicate this logic so wrapping it inside the custom hook it's much more\ninside the custom hook it's much more\ninside the custom hook it's much more readable\nreadable\nreadable so um at this point let's create this\nso um at this point let's create this\nso um at this point let's create this red circle\nred circle\nred circle so here let's get rid of the this\nso here let's get rid of the this\nso here let's get rid of the this reanimated style and let's specify\nreanimated style and let's specify\nreanimated style and let's specify background color equal to red\nbackground color equal to red\nbackground color equal to red so let's reload\nso let's reload\nso let's reload so\nso\nso let's also add here the position\nlet's also add here the position\nlet's also add here the position absolute to this circle\nand we can see that nothing is working\nand we can see that nothing is working we need\nwe need\nwe need to tell to the red circle to follow the\nto tell to the red circle to follow the\nto tell to the red circle to follow the blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle and in order to do that\nand in order to do that\nand in order to do that let's reuse this custom hook\nlet's reuse this custom hook\nlet's reuse this custom hook and let's define\nand let's define\nand let's define so let's uh let's call it here\nso let's uh let's call it here\nso let's uh let's call it here reanimated blue circle style\nreanimated blue circle style\nreanimated blue circle style let's call it follow x will be our blue\nlet's call it follow x will be our blue\nlet's call it follow x will be our blue follow x\nfollow x\nfollow x follow y will be blue follow y\nfollow y will be blue follow y\nfollow y will be blue follow y and we are going to follow not the\nand we are going to follow not the\nand we are going to follow not the translatex but we are going to follow\ntranslatex but we are going to follow\ntranslatex but we are going to follow the blue follow x\nthe blue follow x\nthe blue follow x and the blue\nand the blue\nand the blue follow y\nfollow y\nfollow y so uh here it will be\nso uh here it will be\nso uh here it will be reanimated style it will be called\nreanimated style it will be called\nreanimated style it will be called reanimated red circle style\nreanimated red circle style\nreanimated red circle style so i hope that it is clear basically we\nso i hope that it is clear basically we\nso i hope that it is clear basically we are just following from this blue\nare just following from this blue\nare just following from this blue so we are just standing to the red\nso we are just standing to the red\nso we are just standing to the red circle to follow the blue\ncircle to follow the blue\ncircle to follow the blue uh the blue circle\nuh the blue circle\nuh the blue circle and we are just\nand we are just\nand we are just updating here the the name for\nupdating here the the name for\nupdating here the the name for the clarity\nthe clarity\nthe clarity so let's call it reanimated blue circle\nso let's call it reanimated blue circle\nso let's call it reanimated blue circle style here\nstyle here\nstyle here and here let's say reanimate red circle\nand here let's say reanimate red circle\nand here let's say reanimate red circle style\nstyle\nstyle so i know that this explanation is a\nso i know that this explanation is a\nso i know that this explanation is a little bit messy but it is a little bit\nlittle bit messy but it is a little bit\nlittle bit messy but it is a little bit hard to\nhard to\nhard to explain it in a simple way\nexplain it in a simple way\nexplain it in a simple way but the concept is really simple we are\nbut the concept is really simple we are\nbut the concept is really simple we are just telling to each circle to follow\njust telling to each circle to follow\njust telling to each circle to follow the previous circle\nthe previous circle\nthe previous circle so you can see here that everything is\nso you can see here that everything is\nso you can see here that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so\nso\nso the last circle that we want to animate\nthe last circle that we want to animate\nthe last circle that we want to animate is the green circle and at this point it\nis the green circle and at this point it\nis the green circle and at this point it should be almost uh\nshould be almost uh\nshould be almost uh easy to understand how to do it\neasy to understand how to do it\neasy to understand how to do it we are just going to replicate this\nwe are just going to replicate this\nwe are just going to replicate this custom hook\ncustom hook\ncustom hook this one will be called\nthis one will be called\nthis one will be called let's say red followex\nlet's say red followex\nlet's say red followex red follow y\nred follow y\nred follow y and this one is going to be called uh\nand this one is going to be called uh\nand this one is going to be called uh reanimated uh\nreanimated uh\nreanimated uh no this one was was actually right\nno this one was was actually right\nno this one was was actually right so here we are going to follow from the\nso here we are going to follow from the\nso here we are going to follow from the green\ngreen\ngreen circle we are going to follow the red\ncircle we are going to follow the red\ncircle we are going to follow the red circle so red follow x and red follow y\ncircle so red follow x and red follow y\ncircle so red follow x and red follow y we are not going to use follow x and\nwe are not going to use follow x and\nwe are not going to use follow x and follow y\nfollow y\nfollow y and we are going to rename this style in\nand we are going to rename this style in\nand we are going to rename this style in green circle style\ngreen circle style\ngreen circle style so let's pass it right here\nso let's pass it right here\nso let's pass it right here so let's reload\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check is the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue circle\ncircle\ncircle so um let's say that we release the\nso um let's say that we release the\nso um let's say that we release the finger in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say that that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the left side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen we need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with the translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero otherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on the right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to animate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the translate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width so we can handle this on release gesture\nso we can handle this on release gesture\nso we can handle this on release gesture with the unend callback provided by the\nwith the unend callback provided by the\nwith the unend callback provided by the gesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen and here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check the current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this translatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen width\nwidth\nwidth we can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value equal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me fix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater than a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if this circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of the screen\nthe screen\nthe screen we need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value equal to screen width\nequal to screen width\nequal to screen width otherwise let's say translate x value\notherwise let's say translate x value\notherwise let's say translate x value equal to 0.\nequal to 0.\nequal to 0. so\nso\nso of course we need to\nof course we need to\nof course we need to define this screen width and as always\ndefine this screen width and as always\ndefine this screen width and as always we can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions api from react native\napi from react native\napi from react native so let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the screen width\nscreen width\nscreen width and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so\nso\nso nothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's because the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the center of the screen\ncenter of the screen\ncenter of the screen so we need to remove from the container\nso we need to remove from the container\nso we need to remove from the container style the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify content property\ncontent property\ncontent property and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this behavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to translate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen width but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value uh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value needs to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus 80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle so let's\nso let's\nso let's see what's going on\nsee what's going on\nsee what's going on and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly\nworking smoothly\nworking smoothly so let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80 let's define here the size equal to 80.\nsize here\nsize here and let's say\nand let's say\nand let's say size and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2. so uh\nso uh\nso uh of course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect uh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but you can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the animation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the width spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's because uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are not animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but we are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x parameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are are already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring animation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the translate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why so that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working nicely\nnicely\nnicely so thanks a lot for staying with me all\nso thanks a lot for staying with

in the description\ndescription\ndescription that said we can finally move on the\nthat said we can finally move on the\nthat said we can finally move on the code part\nso here i've created a react

so\nso\nso here you can see that i'm using the\nhere you can see that i'm using the\nhere you can see that i'm using the version 44 of the express decay\nversion 44 of the express decay\nversion 44 of

will need a\njust handler package we will need a\njust handler package we will need a version above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we are going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package with a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0 version so in order to complete the reanimated\nso in order to complete the reanimated\nso in order to complete the reanimated installation installation\ninstallation installation\ninstallation installation don't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin in the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js so that said we can start\nso that said we can start\nso that said we can start to display our circle\nto display our circle\nto display our circle on the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see here styles.circle\nhere styles.circle\nhere styles.circle and let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style so we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to 80\n80\n80 a width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say aspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1 and background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say blue\nblue\nblue so since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify here the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and for design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the opacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8 so\nso\nso at this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to see how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture handler works\nhandler works\nhandler works so\nso\nso normally\nnormally\nnormally if we want to\nif we want to\nif we want to translate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen we use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component from react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but with the\nwith the\nwith the version with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the so of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above the 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a gesture detector\ngesture detector\ngesture detector so uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh instead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin transfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth we can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture with the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component so uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate this view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view we are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated and in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we need to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture property\nproperty\nproperty so in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture property we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture right here\nright here\nright here so\nso\nso the default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version 2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler was to use the hook\nwas to use the hook\nwas to use the hook use animated\nuse animated\nuse animated use animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react natively animated\nnatively animated\nnatively animated so this one\nso this one\nso this one and here\nand here\nand here we can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks that we want to handle\nthat we want to handle\nthat we want to handle so instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach we can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component from the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler we can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan gesture\ngesture\ngesture and we can specify here\nand we can specify here\nand we can specify here all the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks so\nso\nso for instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation the default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active callback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update method\nmethod\nmethod so here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event and let's print\nand let's print\nand let's print the event translation x\nthe event translation x\nthe event translation x so of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this property to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector and let's reload\nso here\nso here you can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening you can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x values\nvalues\nvalues so\nso\nso in order to update\nin order to update\nin order to update this uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this translation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass the translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view so basically there are\nso basically there are\nso basically there are so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say minus different\nminus different\nminus different minus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two versions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler but what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is that right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on update callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler and not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated so this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between the previous approach but\nthe previous approach but\nthe previous approach but from the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that almost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing so here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to access the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex shared value\nshared value\nshared value and we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation x inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value and let's pass\nand let's pass\nand let's pass so let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value inside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated style\nstyle\nstyle so here let's return\nso here let's return\nso here let's return transform\ntransform\ntransform and let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex translatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value so if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this kind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and use animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my playlist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to reanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the video description of course\nvideo description of course\nvideo description of course so here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view and let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening so we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working nicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this animation\nanimation\nanimation you can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch so basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the translatex\ntranslatex\ntranslatex shared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and therefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping the previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart from the beginning\nfrom the beginning\nfrom the beginning so we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a second but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y so let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y shared value\nshared value\nshared value and let's save\nand let's save\nand let's save the event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here let's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style also the translate y value\nso let's reload\nso let's reload we can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y axis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis and if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same problem that we had before\nproblem that we had before\nproblem that we had before and in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need to store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state in um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object in the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture handler we\nhandler we\nhandler we deal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the the context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each different codec\ndifferent codec\ndifferent codec so here normally we would have access to\nso here normally we would have access to\nso here normally we would have access to this context object\nthis context object\nthis context object but in the latest version we need to\nbut in the latest version we need to\nbut in the latest version we need to handle ourselves this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as a shared value\na shared value\na shared value so let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object and let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state so inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to save two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and a y value\na y value\na y value and we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous position on the start callback\nposition on the start

perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so um\nso um\nso um we are able to scroll everywhere this\nwe are able to scroll everywhere this\nwe are able to scroll everywhere this kind of circle\nkind of circle\nkind of circle but it isn't the animation that we want\nbut it isn't the animation that we want\nbut it isn't the animation that we want so we don't want that this circle\nso we don't want that this circle\nso we don't want that this circle follows perfectly\nfollows perfectly\nfollows perfectly our our finger but we want\nour our finger but we want\nour our finger but we want that it follows with the spring\nthat it follows with the spring\nthat it follows with the spring animation\nanimation\nanimation and in order to do it\nand in order to do it\nand in order to do it let's define here\nlet's define here\nlet's define here the\nthe\nthe so let's uh derive the follow x position\nso let's uh derive the follow x position\nso let's uh derive the follow x position so this follow x position will be our\nso this follow x position will be our\nso this follow x position will be our circle x position\ncircle x position\ncircle x position we are going to derive the circle x\nwe are going to derive the circle x\nwe are going to derive the circle x position from the translate x value\nposition from the translate x value\nposition from the translate x value and we are going to derive the follow y\nand we are going to derive the follow y\nand we are going to derive the follow y position from this translate y value\nposition from this translate y value\nposition from this translate y value so let's specify here follow x and\nso let's specify here follow x and\nso let's specify here follow x and follow y\nso of course uh here nothing is changing\nso of course uh here nothing is changing we are just uh refactoring a little bit\nwe are just uh refactoring a little bit\nwe are just uh refactoring a little bit this code\nthis code\nthis code so you can see that we are using of\nso you can see that we are using of\nso you can see that we are using of course use the right value from\ncourse use the right value from\ncourse use the right value from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated but since we want to follow it with a\nbut since we want to follow it with a\nbut since we want to follow it with a spring animation\nspring animation\nspring animation let's specify here the width spring\nlet's specify here the width spring\nlet's specify here the width spring high order function from a reanimated\nhigh order function from a reanimated\nhigh order function from a reanimated so with spring\nso with spring\nso with spring and let's see what's going on\nand let's see what's going on\nand let's see what's going on so you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect right here\nright here\nright here so um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to do\ndo\ndo we are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle and the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this translatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow this follow x value and the follow y value\nfollow x value and the follow y value\nfollow x value and the follow y value so basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow this\nthis\nthis blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle so we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and over this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order to avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just create a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook basically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create a custom hook use\na custom hook use\na custom hook use called use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated position so here we are going to access the\nso here we are going to access the\nso here we are going to access the position that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's say animated position\nsay animated position\nsay animated position of course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this animated position type\nanimated position type\nanimated position type so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say this animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x and a y shared value\nand a y shared value\nand a y shared value so we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance the translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate y value\ny value\ny value so let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value and y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated shared value\nshared value\nshared value of type number\nof type number\nof type number and here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y so we are just going to copy all this\nso we are just going to copy all this\nso we are just going to copy all this logic\nlogic\nlogic and let's paste right here\nand let's paste right here\nand let's paste right here so instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are going to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x and the y value\nand the y value\nand the y value so let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are going to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow y\ny\ny and the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style so let's\nso let's\nso let's remove this logic\nremove this logic\nremove this logic and let's just say\nand let's just say\nand let's just say use follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated position x will be equal to translate x\nequal to translate x\nequal to translate x and y will be equal to translate y\nand y will be equal to translate y\nand y will be equal to translate y and we are going to access follow x\nand we are going to access follow x\nand we are going to access follow x follow y and reanimated style\nfollow y and reanimated style\nfollow y and reanimated style so\nso\nso basically here we um we have just\nbasically here we um we have just\nbasically here we um we have just refactored a little bit the code nothing\nrefactored a little bit the code nothing\nrefactored a little bit the code nothing is changing um it's just for uh the sake\nis changing um it's just for uh the sake\nis changing um it's just for uh the sake of clarity so uh right now we are going\nof clarity so uh right now we are going\nof clarity so uh right now we are going to replicate this logic so wrapping it\nto replicate this logic so wrapping it\nto replicate this logic so wrapping it inside the custom hook it's much more\ninside the custom hook it's much more\ninside the custom hook it's much more readable\nreadable\nreadable so um at this point let's create this\nso um at this point let's create this\nso um at this point let's create this red circle\nred circle\nred circle so here let's get rid of the this\nso here let's get rid of the this\nso here let's get rid of the this reanimated style and let's specify\nreanimated style and let's specify\nreanimated style and let's specify background color equal to red\nbackground color equal to red\nbackground color equal to red so let's reload\nso let's reload\nso let's reload so\nso\nso let's also add here the position\nlet's also add here the position\nlet's also add here the position absolute to this circle\nand we can see that nothing is working\nand we can see that nothing is working we need\nwe need\nwe need to tell to the red circle to follow the\nto tell to the red circle to follow the\nto tell to the red circle to follow the blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle and in order to do that\nand in order to do that\nand in order to do that let's reuse this custom hook\nlet's reuse this custom hook\nlet's reuse this custom hook and let's define\nand let's define\nand let's define so let's uh let's call it here\nso let's uh let's call it here\nso let's uh let's call it here reanimated blue circle style\nreanimated blue circle style\nreanimated blue circle style let's call it follow x will be our blue\nlet's call

it will be reanimated style it will be called\nreanimated style it will be called\nreanimated style it will be called reanimated red circle style\nreanimated red circle style\nreanimated red circle style so i hope that it is clear basically we\nso i hope that it is clear basically we\nso i hope that it is clear basically we are just following from this blue\nare just following from this blue\nare just following from this blue so we are just standing to the red\nso we are just standing to the red\nso we are just standing to the red circle to follow the blue\ncircle to follow the blue\ncircle to follow the blue uh the blue circle\nuh the blue circle\nuh the blue circle and we are just\nand we are just\nand we are just updating here the the name for\nupdating here the the name for\nupdating here the the name for the clarity\nthe clarity\nthe clarity so let's call it reanimated blue circle\nso let's call it reanimated blue circle\nso let's call it reanimated blue circle style here\nstyle here\nstyle here and here let's say reanimate red circle\nand here let's say reanimate red circle\nand here let's say reanimate red circle style\nstyle\nstyle so i know that this explanation is a\nso i know that this explanation is a\nso i know that this explanation is a little bit messy but it is a little bit\nlittle bit messy but it is a little bit\nlittle bit messy but it is a little bit hard to\nhard to\nhard to explain it in a simple way\nexplain it in a simple way\nexplain it in a simple way but the concept is really simple we are\nbut the concept is really simple we are\nbut the concept is really simple we are just telling to each circle to follow\njust telling to each circle to follow\njust telling to each circle to follow the previous circle\nthe previous circle\nthe previous circle so you can see here that everything is\nso you can see here that everything is\nso you can see here that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so\nso\nso the last circle that we want to animate\nthe last circle that we want to animate\nthe last circle that we want to animate is the green circle and at this point it\nis the green circle and at this point it\nis the green circle and at this point it should be almost uh\nshould be almost uh\nshould be almost uh easy to understand how to do it\neasy to understand how to do it\neasy to understand how to do it we are just going to replicate this\nwe are just going to replicate this\nwe are just going to replicate this custom hook\ncustom hook\ncustom hook this one will be called\nthis one will be called\nthis one will be called let's say red followex\nlet's say red followex\nlet's say red followex red follow y\nred follow y\nred follow y and this one is going to be called uh\nand this one is going to be called uh\nand this one is going to be called uh reanimated uh\nreanimated uh\nreanimated uh no this one was was actually right\nno this one was was actually right\nno this one was was actually right so here we are going to follow from the\nso here we are going to follow from the\nso here we are going to follow from the green\ngreen\ngreen circle we are going to follow the red\ncircle we are going to follow the red\ncircle we are going to follow the red circle so red follow x and red follow y\ncircle so red follow x and red follow y\ncircle so red follow x and red follow y we are not going to use follow x and\nwe are not going to use follow x and\nwe are not going to use follow x and follow y\nfollow y\nfollow y and we are going to rename this style in\nand we are going to rename this style in\nand we are going to rename this style in green circle style\ngreen circle style\ngreen circle style so let's pass it right here\nso let's pass it right here\nso let's pass it right here so let's reload\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check is the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue circle\ncircle\ncircle so um let's say that we release the\nso um let's say that we release the\nso um let's say that we release the finger in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say that that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the left side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen we need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with the translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero otherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on the right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to animate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the translate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width so we can handle this on release gesture\nso we can handle this on release gesture\nso we can handle this on release gesture with the unend callback provided by the\nwith the unend callback provided by the\nwith the unend callback provided by the gesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen and here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check the current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this translatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen width\nwidth\nwidth we can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value equal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me fix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater than a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if this circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of the screen\nthe screen\nthe screen we need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value equal to screen width\nequal to screen width\nequal to screen width otherwise let's say translate x value\notherwise let's say translate x value\notherwise let's say translate x value equal to 0.\nequal to 0.\nequal to 0. so\nso\nso of course we need to\nof course we need to\nof course we need to define this screen width and as always\ndefine this screen width and as always\ndefine this screen width and as always we can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions api from react native\napi from react native\napi from react native so let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the screen width\nscreen width\nscreen width and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so\nso\nso nothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's because the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the center of the screen\ncenter of the screen\ncenter of the screen so we need to remove from the container\nso we need to remove from the container\nso we need to remove from the container style the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify content property\ncontent property\ncontent property and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this behavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to translate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen width but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value uh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value needs to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus 80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle so let's\nso let's\nso let's see what's going on\nsee what's going on\nsee what's going on and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly\nworking smoothly\nworking smoothly so let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80 let's define here the size equal to 80.\nsize here\nsize here and let's say\nand let's say\nand let's say size and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2. so uh\nso uh\nso uh of course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect uh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but you can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the animation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the width spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's because uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are not animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but we are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x parameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are are already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring animation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the translate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why so that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working nicely\nnicely\nnicely so thanks a lot for staying with me all\nso thanks a lot for staying with me all\nso thanks a lot for staying with me all the time i hope that you like this\nthe time i hope that you like this\nthe time i hope that you like this animation and you like this

in five minutes or\nnative Josh Chandler in five minutes or\nnative Josh Chandler in five minutes or less let's have a look so I'm gonna\nless let's have a look so I'm gonna\nless let's have a look so I'm gonna replace the touchable without feedback\nreplace the touchable without feedback\nreplace the touchable without feedback by my own component which I'm gonna call\nby my own component which I'm

going to\ncomponent the first thing I'm going to\ncomponent the first thing I'm going to do before building any effects is that\ndo before building any effects is that\ndo before building any effects is that I'm gonna do a drop-in replacement for\nI'm gonna do a drop-in replacement for\nI'm gonna do a drop-in replacement for touchable without feedback using the tap\ntouchable without feedback using the tap\ntouchable without feedback using the tap gesture handler from react native judge\ngesture handler from react native judge\ngesture handler from react native judge Chandler so I'm gonna use a tap gesture\nChandler so I'm gonna use a tap gesture\nChandler so I'm gonna use a tap gesture and low from the shine yeah and the\nand low from the shine yeah and the\nand low from the shine yeah and the object handler needs to be wrapped into\nobject handler needs to be wrapped into\nobject handler needs to be wrapped into an animated view so that's fine and I\nan animated view so that's

INRI - to build the\nconvenience function INRI - to build the\nconvenience function INRI - to build the boilerplate for the - Amandla so we need\nboilerplate for the - Amandla so we need\nboilerplate for the - Amandla so we need one animation value which is going to\none animation value which is going to\none animation value which is going to contain the state of the gesture so I'm\ncontain the

change and the state equals and we call on\nand the state equals and we call on\nand the state equals and we call on press let's have a look it doesn't look\npress let's have a look it doesn't look\npress let's have a look it doesn't look too happy\ntoo happy\ntoo happy oh sorry about that\ntwo equals let's have a look okay so now\ntwo equals let's have a look okay so now we have the drop-in replacement for\nwe have the drop-in replacement for\nwe have the drop-in replacement for touchable without feedback now let's add\ntouchable without feedback now let's add\ntouchable without feedback now let's add some feedback\nsome feedback\nsome feedback exactly so here I'm gonna create a new\nexactly so here I'm gonna create a new\nexactly so here I'm gonna create a new animation value let's call it animation\nanimation value let's call it animation\nanimation value let's call it animation and so this is what this is animation\nand so this is what this is animation\nand so this is what this is animation value that will drive the gesture effect\nvalue that will drive the gesture effect\nvalue that will drive the gesture effect so I can pass it as parameter to the top\nso I can pass it as parameter to the top\nso I can pass it as parameter to the top and low so I'm getting it here\nnow we can create a new animation value\nnow we can create a new animation value when so what I want to do is when I\nwhen so what I want to do is when I\nwhen so what I want to do is when I press the background image scale and\npress the background image scale and\npress the background image scale and when I unpress it scales down so what I\nwhen I unpress it scales down so what I\nwhen I unpress it scales down so what I can do is create a new animation value\ncan do is create a new animation value\ncan do is create a new animation value to say should its scale or should it n\nto say should its scale or should it n\nto say should its scale or should it n scale so let me create a new animation\nscale so let me create a new animation\nscale so let me create a new animation value should scale and we can set it to\nvalue should scale and we can set it to\nvalue should scale and we can set it to minus 1 0 means sure and scale 1 means\nminus 1 0 means sure and scale 1 means\nminus 1 0 means sure and scale 1 means it should scale so yeah I can create\nit should scale so yeah I can create\nit should scale so yeah I can create some new conditions when the state\nsome new conditions when the state\nsome new conditions when the state equals state began we set should scale\nequals state began we set should scale\nequals state began we set should scale to 1 and when it fails\nwhen so what kind of states would have\nwhen so what kind of states would have failed and canceled so into input this\nfailed and canceled so into input this\nfailed and canceled so into input this one set should so should scale we said\none set should so should scale we said\none set should so should scale we said to zero oops\nall right now if we scale we set the\nall right now if we scale we set the animation value from 0 to 1 if should\nanimation value from 0 to 1 if should\nanimation value from 0 to 1 if should scale is 0 we set the animation value\nscale is 0 we set the animation value\nscale is 0 we set the animation value from 1 to 0 so if should scale we can\nfrom 1 to 0 so if should scale we can\nfrom 1 to 0 so if should scale we can run so I'm gonna set the animation value\nrun so I'm gonna set the animation value\nrun so I'm gonna set the animation value using a run timing function and in the\nusing a run timing function and in the\nusing a run timing function and in the clock so we go from 0 to so here's the\nclock so we go from 0 to so here's the\nclock so we go from 0 to so here's the configuration - One Direction 250 and\nconfiguration - One Direction 250 and\nconfiguration - One Direction 250 and easing it's just gonna be use linear\neasing it's just gonna be use linear\neasing it's just gonna be use linear here I need to create a clock\nanimation and when should scale equals\nanimation and when should scale equals zero we go from one to zero and now we\nzero we go from one to zero and now we\nzero we go from one to zero and now we can use this value to interpolate a\ncan use this value to interpolate a\ncan use this value to interpolate a scale transformation so I can\nscale transformation so I can\nscale transformation so I can interpolate animation I'm going to use\ninterpolate animation I'm going to use\ninterpolate animation I'm going to use since we go only from 0 to 1 I can use B\nsince we go only from 0 to 1 I can use B\nsince we go only from 0 to 1 I can use B be binary interpolation from Reed ash so\nbe binary interpolation from Reed ash so\nbe binary interpolation from Reed ash so we go from 0 to 1 at 0 we are at 1 at\nwe go from 0 to 1 at 0 we are at 1 at\nwe go from 0 to 1 at 0 we are at 1 at let's say yeah we can tweak any values\nlet's say yeah we can tweak any values\nlet's say yeah we can tweak any values when we had one we want to be at 1.5\nwhen we had one we want to be at 1.5\nwhen we had one we want to be at 1.5 let's say and I can add it here\nlet's say and I can add it here\nlet's say and I can add it here transform scale and yeah I'm gonna use\ntransform scale and yeah I'm gonna use\ntransform scale and yeah I'm gonna use an animated image so let's have a look\nthis is so 11.5 it seems to be the\nthis is so 11.5 it seems to be the opposite seems to be happening\nall right so I tap it skating ice Li I\nall right so I tap it skating ice Li I can sell the gesture scales back very\ncan sell the gesture scales back very\ncan sell the gesture scales back very nice so now we do get some feedback so I\nnice so now we do get some feedback so I\nnice so now we do get some feedback so I think that's it guys I hope you enjoyed\nthink that's it guys I hope you enjoyed\nthink that's it guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you do you can buy me a\nthis video if you do you can buy me a\nthis video if you do you can buy me a coffee to support the channel and I will\ncoffee to support the channel and I will\ncoffee to support the channel and I will give you access to the private github\ngive you access to the private github\ngive you access to the

learn awesome so let's get started\nto learn awesome so let's get started\nto learn awesome so let's get started first of all we need to head to the\nfirst of all we need to head to the\nfirst of all we need to head to the github repo that's called react for\ngithub repo that's called react for\ngithub repo that's called react for designers if you haven't started the\ndesigners if you haven't started the\ndesigners if you haven't started the project yet you might want to clone this\nproject yet you might want to clone this\nproject yet you might want to clone this first and also it's important to update\nfirst and also it's important to update\nfirst and also it's important to update the assets because we do have new assets\nthe assets because we do have new assets\nthe assets because we do have new assets so I'm gonna copy this link go to\nso I'm gonna copy this link go to\nso I'm gonna copy this link go to terminal and do first go to\nterminal and do first go to\nterminal and do first go to downloads and obviously you can skip\ndownloads and obviously you can skip\ndownloads and obviously you can skip this part if you already have done the\nthis part if you already have done the\nthis part if you already have done the part one right now do git clone and then\npart one right now do git clone and then\npart one right now do git clone and then the link this is going to create that\nthe link this is going to create that\nthe link this is going to create that project folder and going to that\nproject folder and going to that\nproject folder and going to that reactivated for designers then I can do\nreactivated for designers then I can do\nreactivated for designers then I can do NPM install and this is going to install\nNPM install and this is going to install\nNPM install and this is going to install all the missing libraries now I can\nall the missing libraries now I can\nall the missing libraries now I can start expose or expose start and this is\nstart expose or expose start and this is\nstart expose or expose start and this is going to launch the dev tools into the\ngoing to launch the dev tools into the\ngoing to launch the dev tools into the browser now this might take a while\nbrowser now this might take a while\nbrowser now this might take a while but once it's launched now you can run\nbut once it's launched now you can run\nbut once it's launched now you can run on iOS simulator or Android emulator and\non iOS simulator or Android emulator and\non iOS simulator or Android emulator and voila we should have something like this\nvoila we should have something like this\nvoila we should have something like this now this is where we left off which\nnow this is where we left off which\nnow this is where we left off which means that we have this much done the\nmeans that we have this much done the\nmeans that we have this much done the cards the article page the menu so we\ncards the article page the menu so we\ncards the article page the menu so we don't have the courses and a project we\ndon't have the courses and a project we\ndon't have the courses and a project we do also have some issues which we're\ndo also have some issues which we're\ndo also have some issues which we're going to fix in this course now let's\ngoing to fix in this course now let's\ngoing to fix in this course now let's check our code we're gonna bring this\ncheck our code we're gonna bring this\ncheck our code we're gonna bring this folder into Visual Studio code and then\nfolder into Visual Studio code and

I go\nyou see right here now before I go\nyou see right here now before I go further I do want to explain a little\nfurther I do want to explain a little\nfurther I do want to explain a little bit about the theme that I'm using and\nbit about the theme that I'm using and\nbit about the theme that I'm using and the extension so I'm gonna go to\nthe extension so I'm gonna go to\nthe extension so I'm gonna go to extensions so you can see that I install\nextensions so you can see that I install\nextensions so you can see that I install a bunch of them such as prettier which\na bunch of them

you know to move\nthis in order to change you know to move\nthis in order to change you know to move this card as we drag it so this is\nthis card as we drag it so this is\nthis card as we drag it so this is basically setting up the gesture so\nbasically setting up the gesture so\nbasically setting up the gesture so we're enabling it and then when you know\nwe're enabling it and then when you

saying okay we have to move\nessentially saying okay we have to move that this thing well the state position\nthat this thing well the state position\nthat this thing well the state position of x and y and now we just need an\nof x and y and now we just need an\nof x and y and now we just need an animated view that we can wrap around\nanimated view that we can wrap around\nanimated view that we can wrap around the card which is called project I'm\nthe card which is called project I'm\nthe card which is called project I'm gonna go here and an open animated dot\ngonna go here and an open

like to have some drop shadow\nof that I like to have some drop shadow so let me add some drop shadow box\nso let me add some drop shadow box\nso let me add some drop shadow box shadow and set the you know exposition\nshadow and set the you know exposition\nshadow and set the you know exposition to 0 Y position to 10 pixel and a spread\nto 0 Y position to 10 pixel and a spread\nto 0 Y position to 10 pixel and a spread to 20 and using RGB a because we can use\nto 20 and using RGB a because we can use\nto 20 and using RGB a because we can use the opacity as well so 0 0 0 that's 4\nthe opacity as well so 0 0 0 that's 4\nthe opacity as well so 0 0 0 that's 4 black and then 0.15 for the opacity at\nblack and then 0.15 for the opacity at\nblack and then 0.15 for the opacity at 15% so now we have some really nice drop\n15% so now we have some really nice drop\n15% so now we have some really nice drop shadow\nshadow\nshadow so at this point we just need to set the\nso at this point we just need to set the\nso at this point we just need to set the styling for the text but also fix some\nstyling for the text but also fix some\nstyling for the text but also fix some of the round corners here because of the\nof the round corners here because of the\nof the round corners here because of the image so for the text I'm gonna set the\nimage so for the text I'm gonna set the\nimage so for the text I'm gonna set the font size to 17 which is a recommended\nfont size to 17 which is a recommended\nfont size to 17 which is a recommended font size for the body text and I'm also\nfont size for the body text and I'm also\nfont size for the body text and I'm also going to set the margin to 20 pixels so\ngoing to set the margin to 20 pixels so\ngoing to set the margin to 20 pixels so that we have some padding and it's\nthat we have some padding and it's\nthat we have some padding and it's recommended to have you know 10 to 20\nrecommended to have you know 10 to 20\nrecommended to have you know 10 to 20 pixels usually and the line height which\npixels usually and the line height which\npixels usually and the line height which is really important as well for you know\nis really important as well for you know\nis really important as well for you know especially body text I'm gonna set it to\nespecially body text I'm gonna set it to\nespecially body text I'm gonna set it to a 24 and of course you can reference the\na 24 and of course you can reference the\na 24 and of course you can reference the envision Studio file that is provided\nenvision Studio file that is provided\nenvision Studio file that is provided you know a part 1 of discourse but also\nyou know a part 1 of discourse but also\nyou know a part 1 of discourse but also part 2 you can get all the colors that\npart 2 you can get all the colors that\npart 2 you can get all the colors that we need for you know implementing our\nwe need for you know implementing our\nwe need for you know implementing our design in this case I'm just gonna use\ndesign in this case I'm just gonna use\ndesign in this case I'm just gonna use this one so this color code right here\nthis one so this color code right here\nthis one so this color code right here and come back and set the color to that\nand come back and set the color to that\nand come back and set the color to that color code and now we have some really\ncolor code and now we have some really\ncolor code and now we have some really nice colors we just need to fix the\nnice colors we just need to fix the\nnice colors we just need to fix the rounded corners here so what we can do\nrounded corners here so what we can do\nrounded corners here so what we can do is that remember that we have like the\nis that remember that we have like the\nis that remember that we have like the cover here that is the container for the\ncover here that is the container for the\ncover here that is the container for the image so the image is at the bottom and\nimage so the image is at the bottom and\nimage so the image is at the bottom and then these two layers are positioned at\nthen these two layers are positioned at\nthen these two layers are positioned at absolute and we can use this container\nabsolute and we can use this container\nabsolute and we can use this container to set the overflow and so we're gonna\nto set the overflow and so we're gonna\nto set the overflow and so we're gonna go to cover and we're gonna set the\ngo to cover and we're gonna set the\ngo to cover and we're gonna set the border radius only the top left and the\nborder radius only the top left and the\nborder radius only the top left and the top right usually you can set the border\ntop right usually you can set the border\ntop right usually you can set the border radius on the image but the problem is\nradius on the image but the problem is\nradius on the image but the problem is you cannot be specific about which\nyou cannot be specific about which\nyou cannot be specific about which corner and the only way to do that is to\ncorner and the only way to do that is to\ncorner and the only way to do that is to apply that on the view container that\napply that on the view container that\napply that on the view container that surrounds the image so we're gonna do\nsurrounds the image so we're gonna do\nsurrounds the image so we're gonna do exactly that supporter top left radius\nexactly that supporter top left radius\nexactly that supporter top left radius 214 and border top right radius 214 and\n214 and border top right radius 214 and\n214 and border top right radius 214 and we're also going to apply\nwe're also going to apply\nwe're also going to apply overflow:hidden\nthis is like in CSS why are you doing a\nthis is like in CSS why are you doing a masking and now you can see that we have\nmasking and now you can see that we have\nmasking and now you can see that we have our beautiful rounded corners right here\nour beautiful rounded corners right here\nour beautiful rounded corners right here and that's it we have not only our\nand that's it we have not only our\nand that's it we have not only our gesture but we have a beautiful UI to\ngesture but we have a beautiful UI to\ngesture but we have a beautiful UI to play with and you can obviously\nplay with and you can obviously\nplay with and you can obviously customize the data and the UI in\ncustomize the data and the UI in\ncustomize the data and the UI in whichever way you want I think you're\nwhichever way you want I think you're\nwhichever way you want I think you're gonna have a

part we're gonna you know go a little bit deeper into\nyou know go a little bit deeper into\nyou know go a little bit deeper into gestures and how to play with multiple\ngestures and how to play with multiple\ngestures and how to play with multiple cards and how to detect the positioning\ncards and how to detect the positioning\ncards and how to detect the positioning so I can drop the card and go

will need a\njust handler package we will need a\njust handler package we will need a version above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we are going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package with a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0

installation\ninstallation installation\ninstallation installation don't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin in the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js so that said we can start\nso that said we can start\nso that said we can start to display our circle\nto display our circle\nto display our circle on the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see here styles.circle\nhere styles.circle\nhere styles.circle and let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style so we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to 80\n80\n80 a width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say aspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1 and background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say blue\nblue\nblue so since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify here the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and for design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the opacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8 so\nso\nso at this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to see how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture handler works\nhandler works\nhandler works so\nso\nso normally\nnormally\nnormally if we want to\nif we want to\nif we want to translate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen we use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component from react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but with the\nwith the\nwith the version with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the so of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above the 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a gesture detector\ngesture detector\ngesture detector so uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh instead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin transfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth we can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture with the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component so uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate this view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view we are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated and in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we need to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture property\nproperty\nproperty so in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture property we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture right here\nright here\nright here so\nso\nso the default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version 2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler was to use the hook\nwas to use the hook\nwas to use the hook use animated\nuse animated\nuse animated use animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react natively animated\nnatively animated\nnatively animated so this one\nso this one\nso this one and here\nand here\nand here we can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks that we want to handle\nthat we want to handle\nthat we want to handle so instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach we can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component from the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler we can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan gesture\ngesture\ngesture and we can specify here\nand we can specify here\nand we can specify here all the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks so\nso\nso for instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation the default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active callback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update method\nmethod\nmethod so here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event and let's print\nand let's print\nand let's print the event translation x\nthe event translation x\nthe event translation x so of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this property to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector and let's reload\nso here\nso here you can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening you can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x values\nvalues\nvalues so\nso\nso in order to update\nin order to update\nin order to update this uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this translation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass the translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view so basically there are\nso basically there are\nso basically there are so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say minus different\nminus different\nminus different minus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two versions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler but what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is that right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on update callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler and not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated so this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between the previous approach but\nthe previous approach but\nthe previous approach but from the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that almost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing so here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to access the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex shared value\nshared value\nshared value and we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation x inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value and let's pass\nand let's pass\nand let's pass so let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value inside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated style\nstyle\nstyle so here let's return\nso here let's return\nso here let's return transform\ntransform\ntransform and let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex translatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value so if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this kind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and use animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my playlist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to reanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the video description of course\nvideo description of course\nvideo description of course so here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view and let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening so we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working nicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this animation\nanimation\nanimation you can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch so basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the translatex\ntranslatex\ntranslatex shared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and therefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping the previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart from the beginning\nfrom the beginning\nfrom the beginning so we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a second but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y so let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y shared value\nshared value\nshared value and let's save\nand let's save\nand let's save the event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here let's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style also the translate y value\nso let's reload\nso let's reload we can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y axis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis and if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same problem that we had before\nproblem that we had before\nproblem that we had before and in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need to store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state in um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object in the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture handler we\nhandler we\nhandler we deal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the the context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each different codec\ndifferent codec\ndifferent codec so here normally we would have access to\nso here normally we would have access to\nso here normally we would have access to this context object\nthis context object\nthis context object but in the latest version we need to\nbut in the latest version we need to\nbut in the latest version we need to handle ourselves this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as a shared value\na shared value\na shared value so let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object and let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state so inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to save two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and a y value\na y value\na y value and we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous position on the start callback\nposition on the start callback\nposition on the start callback so here\nso here\nso here that's the syntax we are going to handle\nthat's the syntax we are going to handle\nthat's the syntax we are going to handle here the context\nhere the context\nhere the context so let's let's say that we want to store\nso let's let's say that we want to store\nso let's let's say that we want to store inside this context the current position\ninside this context the current position\ninside this context the current position so let's say x equal to translate x\nso let's say x equal to translate x\nso let's say x equal to translate x value and y equal to translate y value\nvalue and y equal to translate y value\nvalue and y equal to translate y value and let's keep here let's access\nand let's keep here let's access\nand let's keep here let's access here the context dot value\nhere the context dot value\nhere the context dot value dot x\ndot x\ndot x and this context dot value\nand this context dot value\nand this context dot value dot y\ndot y\ndot y so let's reload\nso let's reload\nso let's reload and you can see that everything is\nand you can see that everything is\nand you can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so um\nso um\nso um we are able to scroll everywhere this\nwe are able to scroll everywhere this\nwe are able to scroll everywhere this kind of circle\nkind of circle\nkind of circle but it isn't the animation that we want\nbut it isn't the animation that we want\nbut it isn't the animation that we want so we don't want that this circle\nso we don't want that this circle\nso we don't want that this circle follows perfectly\nfollows perfectly\nfollows perfectly our our finger but we want\nour our finger but we want\nour our finger but we want that it follows with the spring\nthat it follows with the spring\nthat it follows with the spring animation\nanimation\nanimation and in order to do it\nand in order to do it\nand in order to do it let's define here\nlet's define here\nlet's define here the\nthe\nthe so let's uh derive the follow x position\nso let's uh derive the follow x position\nso let's uh derive the follow x position so this follow x position will be our\nso this follow x position will be our\nso this follow x position will be our circle x position\ncircle x position\ncircle x position we are going to derive the circle x\nwe are going to derive the circle x\nwe are going to derive the circle x position from the translate x value\nposition from the translate x value\nposition from the translate x value and we are going to derive the follow y\nand we are going to derive the follow y\nand we are going to derive the follow y position from this translate y value\nposition from this translate y value\nposition from this translate y value so let's specify here follow x and\nso let's specify here follow x and\nso let's specify here follow x and follow y\nso of course uh here nothing is changing\nso of course uh here nothing is changing we are just uh refactoring a little bit\nwe are just uh refactoring a little bit\nwe are just uh refactoring a little bit this code\nthis code\nthis code so you can see that we are using of\nso you can see that we are using of\nso you can see that we are using of course use the right value from\ncourse use the right value from\ncourse use the right value from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated but since we want to follow it with a\nbut since we want to follow it with a\nbut since we want to follow it with a spring animation\nspring animation\nspring animation let's specify here the width spring\nlet's specify here the width spring\nlet's specify here the width spring high order function from a reanimated\nhigh order function from a reanimated\nhigh order function from a reanimated so with spring\nso with spring\nso with spring and let's see what's going on\nand let's see what's going on\nand let's see what's going on so you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect right here\nright here\nright here so um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to do\ndo\ndo we are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle and the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this translatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow this follow x value and the follow y value\nfollow x value and the follow y value\nfollow x value and the follow y value so basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow this\nthis\nthis blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle so we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and over this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order to avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just create a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook basically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create a custom hook use\na custom hook use\na custom hook use called use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated position so here we are going to access the\nso here we are going to access the\nso here we are going to access the position that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's say animated position\nsay animated position\nsay animated position of course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this animated position type\nanimated position type\nanimated position type so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say this animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x and a y shared value\nand a y shared value\nand a y shared value so we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance the translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate y value\ny value\ny value so let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value and y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated shared value\nshared value\nshared value of type number\nof type number\nof type number and here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y so we are just going to copy all this\nso we are just going to copy all this\nso we are just going to copy all this logic\nlogic\nlogic and let's paste right here\nand let's paste right here\nand let's paste right here so instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are going to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x and the y value\nand the y value\nand the y value so let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are going to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow y\ny\ny and the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style so let's\nso let's\nso let's remove this logic\nremove this logic\nremove this logic and let's just say\nand let's just say\nand let's just say use follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated position x will be equal to translate x\nequal to translate x\nequal to translate x and y will be equal to translate y\nand y will be equal to translate y\nand y will be equal to translate y and we are going to access follow x\nand we are going to access follow x\nand we are going to access follow x follow y and reanimated style\nfollow y and reanimated style\nfollow y and reanimated style so\nso\nso basically here we um we have just\nbasically here we um we have just\nbasically here we um we have just refactored a little bit the code nothing\nrefactored a little bit the code nothing\nrefactored a little bit the code nothing is changing um it's just for uh the sake\nis changing um it's just for uh the sake\nis changing um it's just for uh the sake of clarity so uh right now we are going\nof clarity so uh right now we are going\nof clarity so uh right now we are going to replicate this logic so wrapping it\nto replicate this logic so wrapping it\nto replicate this logic so wrapping it inside the custom hook it's much more\ninside the custom hook it's much more\ninside the custom hook it's much more readable\nreadable\nreadable so um at this point let's create this\nso um at this point let's create this\nso um at this point let's create this red circle\nred circle\nred circle so here let's get rid of the this\nso here let's get rid of the this\nso here let's get rid of the this reanimated style and let's specify\nreanimated style and let's specify\nreanimated style and let's specify background color equal to red\nbackground color equal to red\nbackground color equal to red so let's reload\nso let's reload\nso let's reload so\nso\nso let's also add here the position\nlet's also add here the position\nlet's also add here the position absolute to this circle\nand we can see that nothing is working\nand we can see that nothing is working we need\nwe need\nwe need to tell to the red circle to follow the\nto tell to the red circle to follow the\nto tell to the red circle to follow the blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle and in order to do that\nand in order to do that\nand in order to do that let's reuse this custom hook\nlet's reuse this custom hook\nlet's reuse this custom hook and let's define\nand let's define\nand let's define so let's uh let's call it here\nso let's uh let's call it here\nso let's uh let's call it here reanimated blue circle style\nreanimated blue circle style\nreanimated blue circle style let's call it follow x will be our blue\nlet's call it follow x will be our blue\nlet's call it follow x will be our blue follow x\nfollow x\nfollow x follow y will be blue follow y\nfollow y will be blue follow y\nfollow y will be blue follow y and we are going to follow not the\nand we are going to follow not the\nand we are going to follow not the translatex but we are going to follow\ntranslatex but we are going to follow\ntranslatex but we are going to follow the blue follow x\nthe blue follow x\nthe blue follow x and the blue\nand the blue\nand the blue follow y\nfollow y\nfollow y so uh here it will be\nso uh here it will be\nso uh here it will be reanimated style it will be called\nreanimated style it will be called\nreanimated style it will be called reanimated red circle style\nreanimated red circle style\nreanimated red circle style so i hope that it is clear basically we\nso i hope that it is clear basically we\nso i hope that it is clear basically we are just following from this blue\nare just following from this blue\nare just following from this blue so we are just standing to the red\nso we are just standing to the red\nso we are just standing to the red circle to follow the blue\ncircle to follow the blue\ncircle to follow the blue uh the blue circle\nuh the blue circle\nuh the blue circle and we are just\nand we are just\nand we are just updating here the the name for\nupdating here the the name for\nupdating here the the name for the clarity\nthe clarity\nthe clarity so let's call it reanimated blue circle\nso let's call it reanimated blue circle\nso let's call it reanimated blue circle style here\nstyle here\nstyle here and here let's say reanimate red circle\nand here let's say reanimate red circle\nand here let's say reanimate red circle style\nstyle\nstyle so i know that this explanation is a\nso i know that this explanation is a\nso i know that this explanation is a little bit messy but it is a little bit\nlittle bit messy but it is a little bit\nlittle bit messy but it is a little bit hard to\nhard to\nhard to explain it in a simple way\nexplain it in a simple way\nexplain it in a simple way but the concept is really simple we are\nbut the concept is really simple we are\nbut the concept is really simple we are just telling to each circle to follow\njust telling to each circle to follow\njust telling to each circle to follow the previous circle\nthe previous circle\nthe previous circle so you can see here that everything is\nso you can see here that everything is\nso you can see here that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so\nso\nso the last circle that we want to animate\nthe last circle that we want to animate\nthe last circle that we want to animate is the green circle and at this point it\nis the green circle and at this point it\nis the green circle and at this point it should be almost uh\nshould be almost uh\nshould be almost uh easy to understand how to do it\neasy to understand how to do it\neasy to understand how to do it we are just going to replicate this\nwe are just going to replicate this\nwe are just going to replicate this custom hook\ncustom hook\ncustom hook this one will be called\nthis one will be called\nthis one will be called let's say red followex\nlet's say red followex\nlet's say red followex red follow y\nred follow y\nred follow y and this one is going to be called uh\nand this one is going to be called uh\nand this one is going to be called uh reanimated uh\nreanimated uh\nreanimated uh no this one was was actually right\nno this one was was actually right\nno this one was was actually right so here we are going to follow from the\nso here we are going to follow from the\nso here we are going to follow from the green\ngreen\ngreen circle we are going to follow the red\ncircle we are going to follow the red\ncircle we are going to follow the red circle so red follow x and red follow y\ncircle so red follow x and red follow y\ncircle so red follow x and red follow y we are not going to use follow x and\nwe are not going to use follow x and\nwe are not going to use follow x and follow y\nfollow y\nfollow y and we are going to rename this style in\nand we are going to rename this style in\nand we are going to rename this style in green circle style\ngreen circle style\ngreen circle style so let's pass it right here\nso let's pass it right here\nso let's pass it right here so let's reload\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check is the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue circle\ncircle\ncircle so um let's say that we release the\nso um let's say that we release the\nso um let's say that we release the finger in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say that that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the left side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen we need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with the translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero otherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on the right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to animate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the translate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width so we can handle this on release gesture\nso we can handle this on release gesture\nso we can handle this on release gesture with the unend callback provided by the\nwith the unend callback provided by the\nwith the unend callback provided by the gesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen and here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check the current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this translatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen width\nwidth\nwidth we can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value equal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me fix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater than a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if this circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of the screen\nthe screen\nthe screen we need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value equal to screen width\nequal to screen width\nequal to screen width otherwise let's say translate x value\notherwise let's say translate x value\notherwise let's say translate x value equal to 0.\nequal to 0.\nequal to 0. so\nso\nso of course we need to\nof course we need to\nof course we need to define this screen width and as always\ndefine this screen width and as always\ndefine this screen width and as always we can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions api from react native\napi from react native\napi from react native so let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the screen width\nscreen width\nscreen width and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so\nso\nso nothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's because the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the center of the screen\ncenter of the screen\ncenter of the screen so we need to remove from the container\nso we need to remove from the container\nso we need to remove from the container style the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify\nstyle the align items and justify content property\ncontent property\ncontent property and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this behavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to translate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen width but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value uh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value needs to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus 80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle so let's\nso let's\nso let's see what's going on\nsee what's going on\nsee what's going on and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly\nworking smoothly\nworking smoothly so let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80 let's define here the size equal to 80.\nsize here\nsize here and let's say\nand let's say\nand let's say size and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2. so uh\nso uh\nso uh of course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect uh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but you can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the animation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the width spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's because uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are not animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but we are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x parameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are are already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring animation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the translate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why so that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working nicely\nnicely\nnicely so thanks a lot for staying with me all\nso thanks a lot for staying with

in the description\ndescription\ndescription that said we can finally move on the\nthat said we can finally move on the\nthat said we can finally move on the code part\nso here i've created a react native\nso here i've created a react native product with the latest version of the\nproduct with the latest version of the\nproduct with the latest version of the xbox sdk\nxbox sdk\nxbox sdk so\nso\nso here you can see that i'm using the\nhere you can see that i'm using the\nhere you can see that i'm using the version 44 of the express decay\nversion 44 of the express decay\nversion 44 of

the type configuration\nscratch with the type configuration i've also installed the react native\ni've also installed the react native\ni've also installed the react native just handler package we will need a\njust handler package we will need a\njust handler package we will need a version above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we\nversion above the 2.0 and of course we are going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package\nare going to use the reanimated package with a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0 version\nwith a version above the 2.0 version so in order to complete the reanimated\nso in order to complete the reanimated\nso in order to complete the reanimated installation installation\ninstallation installation\ninstallation installation don't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin\ndon't forget to add the animated plugin in the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js\nin the bubble config.js so that said we can start\nso that said we can start\nso that said we can start to display our circle\nto display our circle\nto display our circle on the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen\non the middle of the screen so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see here styles.circle\nhere styles.circle\nhere styles.circle and let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style\nand let's specify here the circle style so we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to\nso we are going to use a height equal to 80\n80\n80 a width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say\na width equal to 80. so we can also say aspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1\naspect ratio equal to 1 and background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say\nand background color equal to let's say blue\nblue\nblue so since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify\nso since we want a circle let's specify here the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and\nhere the border rate is equal to 40 and for design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the\nfor design purposes let's update the opacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8\nopacity equal to 0.8 so\nso\nso at this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to\nat this point we can already start to see how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture\nsee how the new version of gesture handler works\nhandler works\nhandler works so\nso\nso normally\nnormally\nnormally if we want to\nif we want to\nif we want to translate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen\ntranslate this circle on the screen we use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component\nwe use the pawn gesture handle component from react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but\nfrom react native pressure handler but with the\nwith the\nwith the version with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the\nversion with the version 2.0 with the so of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above\nso of course also with the version above the 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a\nthe 2.0 version we can use just a gesture detector\ngesture detector\ngesture detector so uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh\nso uh the difference is that uh uh instead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin\ninstead of using a punch handler a pin transfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth\ntransfer handler and so on and so forth we can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture\nwe can just use and define every gesture with the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component\nwith the gesture detector component so uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate\nso uh of course we are going to animate this view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an\nthis view let's specify therefore an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view we are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from\nwe are going to use animated from reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated and in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we\nand in order to translate this circle we need to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture\nneed to specify here the gesture property\nproperty\nproperty so in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture\nso in order to specify the gesture property we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture\nproperty we need to define the gesture right here\nright here\nright here so\nso\nso the default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version\nthe default approach before the version 2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler\n2.0 of react native just handler was to use the hook\nwas to use the hook\nwas to use the hook use animated\nuse animated\nuse animated use animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react\nuse animated gesso handler from react natively animated\nnatively animated\nnatively animated so this one\nso this one\nso this one and here\nand here\nand here we can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks\nwe can define the different callbacks that we want to handle\nthat we want to handle\nthat we want to handle so instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach\nso instead of instead of this approach we can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component\nwe can use now the gesture component from the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler\nfrom the react native gesture handler we can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan\nwe can specify that we want a pan gesture\ngesture\ngesture and we can specify here\nand we can specify here\nand we can specify here all the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks\nall the different callbacks so\nso\nso for instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the\nfor instance if we want to handle the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation the default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active\nthe default translation the uh on active callback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update\ncallback we can use the on update method\nmethod\nmethod so here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event\nso here let's access the event and let's print\nand let's print\nand let's print the event translation x\nthe event translation x\nthe event translation x so of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this\nso of course we need to assign this property to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector\nproperty to the gesture detector and let's reload\nso here\nso here you can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening\nyou can see what is happening you can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x\nyou can see the values the translation x values\nvalues\nvalues so\nso\nso in order to update\nin order to update\nin order to update this uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this\nthis uh this circle we need to save this translation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass\ntranslation x value and we need to pass the translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated\nthe translation x with a reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view so basically there are\nso basically there are\nso basically there are so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say minus different\nminus different\nminus different minus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two\nminus difference between the two versions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler\nversions of react native just handler but what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is\nbut what you need to keep in mind is that right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on\nthat right now we are handling the on update callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler\nupdate callback with the gesture handler and not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by\nand not with the unhook provided by reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated so this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between\nso this is a huge difference of between the previous approach but\nthe previous approach but\nthe previous approach but from the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that\nfrom the syntax so we can see that almost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing\nalmost nothing is changing so here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to\nso here let's specify that we want to to access the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex\naccess the shared value the translatex shared value\nshared value\nshared value and we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation\nand we are going to save the translation x inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value\nx inside this shared value and let's pass\nand let's pass\nand let's pass so let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value\nso let's pass this a translate x value inside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated\ninside an animated the area animated style\nstyle\nstyle so here let's return\nso here let's return\nso here let's return transform\ntransform\ntransform and let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex\nand let's say translatex translatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value\ntranslatex dot value so if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this\nso if you are not familiar with this kind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and\nkind of syntax so use shared value and use animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my\nuse animated style you can check out my playlist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to\nplaylist related to animated to reanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the\nreanimated i will put the link in the video description of course\nvideo description of course\nvideo description of course so here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated\nso here let's assign this reanimated style to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view\nstyle to this animated view and let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening\nand let's see what is happening so we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working nicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this\nnicely but if i start again this animation\nanimation\nanimation you can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch\nyou can see this glitch so basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the\nso basically the previous value of the translatex\ntranslatex\ntranslatex shared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and\nshared value isn't stored anywhere and therefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping\ntherefore the animation isn't keeping the previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart\nthe previous state but it always restart from the beginning\nfrom the beginning\nfrom the beginning so we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a\nso we are going to fix this issue in a second but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the\nsecond but for now let's also handle the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y so let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y\nso let's create here the translate y shared value\nshared value\nshared value and let's save\nand let's save\nand let's save the event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here\nthe event.translation y right here let's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style\nlet's add inside this reanimate style also the translate y value\nso let's reload\nso let's reload we can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the\nwe can see that we are handling the translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y axis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis\naxis so the vertical axis and if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same\nand if we restart we have the same problem that we had before\nproblem that we had before\nproblem that we had before and in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need\nand in order to fix it usually we need to store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state\nto store the previo the current state in um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object\nin um inside a context object in the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture\nin the previous version of uh gesture handler we\nhandler we\nhandler we deal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the\ndeal this kind of issue with the the context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each\nthe context object provided by each different

this context object as\nhandle ourselves this context object as a shared value\na shared value\na shared value so let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object\nso let's define here our context object and let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state\nand let's define here the initial state so inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to\nso inside our context we are going to save two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and\nsave two different values an x value and a y value\na y value\na y value and we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous\nand we are going to save the previous position on the start callback\nposition on the start

see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect\nso you can see this beautiful effect right here\nright here\nright here so um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to\nso um at this point what we are going to do\ndo\ndo we are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle\nwe are going to create the red circle and the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this\nand the red circle will not follow this translatex value but it will follow this\ntranslatex value but it will follow

follow\nso basically the red circle will follow\nso basically the red circle will follow this\nthis\nthis blue circle\nblue circle\nblue circle so we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and\nso we are going to replicate over and over this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order\nover this logic right here but in order to avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just\nto avoid a lot of replication let's just create a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook\ncreate a custom hook basically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create\nbasically we are going to create a custom hook use\na custom hook use\na custom hook use called use follow animated position\ncalled use follow animated

let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's\nposition that we want to follow so let's say animated position\nsay animated position\nsay animated position of course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this\nof course we need to create this animated position type\nanimated position type\nanimated position type so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say this animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x\nthis animated position will have an x and a y shared value\nand a y shared value\nand a y shared value so we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance\nso we are going to follow for instance the translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate\nthe translate x value and the translate y value\ny value\ny value so let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value\nso let's say animate the shared value and y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated\nand y will be an animated shared value\nshared value\nshared value of type number\nof type number\nof type number and here we can access the x and the y\nand here we can access the x and the y\nand here we

paste right here\nand let's paste right here so instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are\nso instead of translatex value we are going to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x\ngoing to follow the x and the y value\nand the y value\nand the y value so let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are\nso let's uh so from this hook we are going to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow\ngoing to return the follow x the follow y\ny\ny and the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style\nand the reanimated style so let's\nso let's\nso let's remove this logic\nremove this logic\nremove this logic and let's just say\nand let's just say\nand let's just say use follow animated position x will be\nuse follow animated

right here\nso let's pass it right here so let's reload\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking perfectly\nworking perfectly so the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check\nso the last thing that we want to check is the current position of this blue\nis the current position of this blue\nis the current

in this position so let's say\nfinger in this position so let's say that that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the\nthat that this blue circle is on the left side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen\nleft side of the of the screen we need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with\nwe need to animate back the circle with the translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero\nthe translatex value equal to zero otherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on\notherwise if this blue circle lies on the right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to\nthe right side of the screen we need to animate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the\nanimate back this circle to with the translate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width\ntranslate x equal to screen width so we can handle this on release

provided by the gesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen\ngesture dot pen and here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check\nand here we can see we can check the current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this\nthe current translatex value and if this translatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen\ntranslatex value is greater than screen width\nwidth\nwidth we can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value\nwe can update this translatex value equal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me\nequal to screen width so actually let me fix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater\nfix it if translatex value is greater than a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if\nthan a screenwave divided by two so if this circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of\nthis circle lies on the right side of the screen\nthe screen\nthe screen we need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value\nwe need to update this translatex value equal to

as always we can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions\nwe can use these dimension dimensions api from react native\napi from react native\napi from react native so let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the\nso let's say here with the screen width\nscreen width\nscreen width and let's see\nand let's see\nand let's see so\nso\nso nothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's\nnothing is working of course and that's because the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial position is is the\nbecause the initial

let's see so here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this\nso here we need to fix also this behavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to\nbehavior basically we don't want to translate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen\ntranslate until screen with the screen width but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value\nwidth but we want to translate x value uh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value\nuh we want that the translate x value needs to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus\nneeds to be equal to screen width minus 80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the size of the circle\n80. 80 is just the

everything is working smoothly\nworking smoothly\nworking smoothly so let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80\nso let me refactor a little bit this 80 let's define here the size equal to 80.\nsize here\nsize here and let's say\nand let's say\nand let's say size and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2.\nsize and size divided by 2. so uh\nso uh\nso uh of course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect\nof course uh here uh you might expect uh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but\nuh to add the width spring animation but you can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the\nyou can see that uh automatically the animation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the\nanimation is working nicely without the width spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's\nwidth spring animation and that's because uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are\nbecause uh here we don't have uh we are not animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but\nnot animating this translatex value but we are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x\nwe are retr we are passing the follow x parameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are\nparameter and the follow x are are already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring\nare already applying the spring animation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the\nanimation to the translatex and the translate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why\ntranslate y value so that's why so that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working\nso that's why this animation is working nicely\nnicely\nnicely so thanks a lot for staying with me all\nso thanks a lot for staying with

From it's README:\n\nThis library provides an API that exposes mobile platform-specific native capabilities of touch and gesture handling and recognition. It allows for defining complex gesture handling and recognition logic that runs 100% in the native thread and is therefore deterministic.\n\nInstallation\nTerminal\n\nCopy\n\n- npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler\n\nIf you are installing this in an existing React Native app, make sure to install expo in your project. Then, follow the installation instructions provided in the library's README or documentation.\n\nLearn more\nVisit official documentation\n\nGet full information on API and its usage.\n\nPrevious (Third-party libraries)\n\n@stripe/stripe-react-native\n\nNext (Third-party libraries)\n\nreact-native-keyboard-controller\n\nWas this doc helpful?\n\nShare your feedback\n\nAsk a question on the forums about react-native-gesture-handler\n\nView open bug reports for react-native-gesture-handler\n\nEdit this page\n\nView llms.txt and llms-full.txt\nLast updated on January 15, 2026\n\nSign up for the Expo Newsletter\n\nSign Up\n\nUnsubscribe at any time.

in this curriculum to do different things\nthis curriculum to do different things\nthis curriculum to do different things and in this example we just look at the\nand in this example we just look at the\nand in this example we just look at the theory of basic curves by animating and\ntheory of basic curves by animating and\ntheory of basic curves by animating and animating a single basic curve so we\nanimating a single basic curve so we\nanimating a single basic curve so we have a stuff point at the bottom left\nhave a stuff point at the bottom left\nhave a stuff point at the bottom left and

looking to implement pinch\nyou are looking to implement pinch transformation or rotate something with\ntransformation or rotate something with\ntransformation or rotate something with the rotate gesture handler you are in\nthe rotate gesture handler you are in\nthe rotate gesture handler you are in for a treat because here we really dig\nfor a treat because here we really dig\nfor a treat because here we really dig in into how to build such complex\nin into how to build such complex\nin into how to build such complex gestures and animations but if you don't\ngestures and animations but

this lesson are extremely useful we are\nlesson are extremely useful we are\nlesson are extremely useful we are looking at vectors we are looking at\nlooking at vectors we are looking at\nlooking at vectors we are looking at accumulating complex transformations and\naccumulating complex transformations and\naccumulating complex transformations and also having you see different gesture\nalso having you see different gesture\nalso having you see different gesture and loves working together so here I'm\nand loves working together so here I'm\nand loves working together so here I'm using the pan gesture Handler and I can\nusing the pan gesture Handler and I can\nusing the pan gesture Handler and I can pinch so we have different gesture and\npinch so we have different gesture and\npinch so we have different gesture and love working well together and we also\nlove working well together and we also\nlove working well together and we also see see set some boundaries to the\nsee see set some boundaries to the\nsee see set some boundaries to the transformations so it's extremely cool\ntransformations so it's extremely cool\ntransformations so it's extremely cool example and we look at really\nexample and we look at really\nexample and we look at really interesting notions in order to\ninteresting notions in order to\ninteresting notions in order to implement search an example before the\nimplement search an example before the\nimplement search an example before the lessons on SVG we also implemented come\nlessons on SVG we also implemented come\nlessons on SVG we also implemented come couple of interesting examples such as\ncouple of interesting examples such as\ncouple of interesting examples such as this one's a dynamic Springer so we use\nthis one's a dynamic Springer so we use\nthis one's a dynamic Springer so we use a pan gesture angler to move the card\na pan gesture angler to move the card\na pan gesture angler to move the card around and the position of the cards\naround and the position of the cards\naround and the position of the cards behind are the position of the card we\nbehind are the position of the card we\nbehind are the position of the card we are moving but using a spring animation\nare moving but using a spring animation\nare moving but using a spring animation so it creates this nice effect of\nso it creates this nice effect of\nso it creates this nice effect of inertia I could play with it for hours\ninertia I could play with it for hours\ninertia I could play with it for hours and\nwe have our Swiss drag to salt example\nwe have our Swiss drag to salt example which is also somewhat related so we can\nwhich is also somewhat related so we can\nwhich is also somewhat related so we can move these cards around and the way this\nmove these cards around and the way this\nmove these cards around and the way this example is implemented is very\nexample is implemented is very\nexample is implemented is very interesting because it's actually a very\ninteresting because it's actually a very\ninteresting because it's actually a very simple implementation we decouple with\nsimple implementation we decouple with\nsimple implementation we decouple with user interaction into two pieces we move\nuser interaction into two pieces we move\nuser interaction into two pieces we move a card so each card is positioned using\na card so each card is positioned using\na card so each card is positioned using an offset value so yeah the first one\nan offset value so yeah the first one\nan offset value so yeah the first one offset value is zero here it's height of\noffset value is zero here it's height of\noffset value is zero here it's height of the first card height of the first Carta\nthe first card height of the first Carta\nthe first card height of the first Carta times two when we move the card we know\ntimes two when we move the card we know\ntimes two when we move the card we know the position that has changed and we\nthe position that has changed and we\nthe position that has changed and we swap the offsets\nswap the offsets\nswap the offsets so the offset values of each cards are\nso the offset values of each cards are\nso the offset values of each cards are changed and then instead of just\nchanged and then instead of just\nchanged and then instead of just swapping the value I mean we swap the\nswapping the value I mean we swap the\nswapping the value I mean we swap the values but instead of showing the\nvalues but instead of showing the\nvalues but instead of showing the swapped values so it will automatically\nswapped values so it will automatically\nswapped values so it will automatically move from one position to the other with\nmove from one position to the other with\nmove from one position to the other with just nicely transition from the original\njust nicely transition from the original\njust nicely transition from the original position to the new one\nposition to the new one\nposition to the new one and that creates this nice effect so a\nand that creates this nice effect so a\nand that creates this nice effect so a very actually simple implementation\nvery actually simple implementation\nvery actually simple implementation because we nicely decoupled such a user\nbecause we nicely decoupled such a user\nbecause we nicely decoupled such a user interaction into two digestible parts\ninteraction into two digestible parts\ninteraction into two digestible parts dragging the thing around that swaps\ndragging the thing around that swaps\ndragging the thing around that swaps offsets of the cards and then building\noffsets of the cards and then building\noffsets of the cards and then building the animation for the castro transition\nthe animation for the castro transition\nthe animation for the castro transition from one position to the other and so we\nfrom one position to the other and so we\nfrom one position to the other and so we look at the basic animations so there\nlook at the basic animations so there\nlook at the basic animations so there are free basic animations in rent method\nare free basic animations in rent method\nare free basic animations in rent method Spring decay so here is nice decay\nSpring decay so here is nice decay\nSpring decay so here is nice decay Panchala it's a most important gesture\nPanchala it's a most important gesture\nPanchala it's a most important gesture to learn in react nutiva so here we just\nto learn in react nutiva so here we just\nto learn in react nutiva so here we just build a very simple example with some\nbuild a very simple example with some\nbuild a very simple example with some disk thief clamps on the boundaries so\ndisk thief clamps on the boundaries so\ndisk thief clamps on the boundaries so the timing function which is important\nthe timing function which is important\nthe timing function which is important to our Ness\nto our Ness\nto our Ness so here we can pause at any point and\nso here we can pause at any point and\nso here we can pause at any point and resume so in reanimated there is a\nresume so in reanimated there is a\nresume so in reanimated there is a notion of clock to deal with animations\nnotion of clock to deal with animations\nnotion of clock to deal with animations across time and here we build this\nacross time and here we build this\nacross time and here we build this example where we can pause and resume\nexample where we can pause and resume\nexample where we can pause and resume the animation at any time to really make\nthe animation at any time to really make\nthe animation at any time to really make sure that we have a strong grip on the\nsure that we have a strong grip on the\nsure that we have a strong grip on the notion of clocks and really\nnotion of clocks and really\nnotion of clocks and really understanding how clocks work is gonna\nunderstanding how clocks work is gonna\nunderstanding how clocks work is gonna enabled us to build really cool examples\nenabled us to build really cool examples\nenabled us to build really cool examples and also to do things to make gestures\nand also to do things to make gestures\nand also to do things to make gestures interruptible so you see I'm catching\ninterruptible so you see I'm catching\ninterruptible so you see I'm catching for instance so it brings back but I can\nfor instance so it brings back but I can\nfor instance so it brings back but I can catch it before it animates back to the\ncatch it before it animates back to the\ncatch it before it animates back to the original position and because we have a\noriginal position and because we have a\noriginal position and because we have a strong grip on the notion of clock we\nstrong grip on the notion of clock we\nstrong grip on the notion of clock we can easily make the gesture inter\ncan easily make the gesture inter\ncan easily make the gesture inter interrupt able and this is going to come\ninterrupt able and this is going to come\ninterrupt able and this is going to come a long way to make your user experience\na long way to make your user experience\na long way to make your user experience really looking great and then before we\nreally looking great and then before we\nreally looking great and then before we do with things the simplest way to\ndo with things the simplest way to\ndo with things the simplest way to animate things in react native even if\nanimate things in react native even if\nanimate things in react native even if you don't know anything about animations\nyou don't know anything about animations\nyou don't know anything about animations is to use transitions so we spend a bit\nis to use transitions so we spend a bit\nis to use transitions so we spend a bit of time to talk about transitions and if\nof time to talk about transitions and if\nof time to talk about transitions and if you are subscriber of the channel you\nyou are subscriber of the channel you\nyou are subscriber of the channel you already know that we can add a\nalready know that we can add a\nalready know that we can add a transitions to animations values or to\ntransitions to animations values or to\ntransitions to animations values or to state of react component so we can\nstate of react component so we can\nstate of react component so we can attach\nattach\nattach a transition\na transition\na transition different states and it will animate\ndifferent states and it will animate\ndifferent states and it will animate nicely from one state to the other\nnicely from one state to the other\nnicely from one state to the other so here we use a used transition hook\nso here we use a used transition hook\nso here we use a used transition hook and if you have changes in the layout\nand if you have changes in the layout\nand if you have changes in the layout you can use the transition API from\nyou can use the
