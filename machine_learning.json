    "text": "Kylie Ying has worked at many interesting places such as MIT, CERN, and Free Code Camp.\nShe's a physicist, engineer, and basically a genius. And now she's going to teach you\nabout machine learning in a way that is accessible to absolute beginners.\nWhat's up you guys? So welcome to Machine Learning for Everyone. If you are someone who\nis interested in machine learning and you think you are considered as everyone, then this video\nis for you. In this video, we'll talk about supervised and unsupervised learning models,\nwe'll go through maybe a little bit of the logic or math behind them, and then we'll also see how\nwe can program it on Google CoLab. If there are certain things that I have done, and you know,\nyou're somebody with more experience than me, please feel free to correct me in the comments\nand we can all as a community learn from this together. So with that, let's just dive right in.\nWithout wasting any time, let's just dive straight into the code and I will be teaching you guys\nconcepts as we go. So this here is the UCI machine learning repository. And basically,\nthey just have a ton of data sets that we can access. And I found this really cool one called\nthe magic gamma telescope data set. So in this data set, if you want to read all this information,\nto summarize what I what I think is going on, is there's this gamma telescope, and we have all\nthese high energy particles hitting the telescope. Now there's a camera, there's a detector that\nactually records certain patterns of you know, how this light hits the camera. And we can use\nproperties of those patterns in order to predict what type of particle caused that radiation. So\nwhether it was a gamma particle, or some other head, like hadron. Down here, these are all of\nthe attributes of those patterns that we collect in the camera. So you can see that there's, you\nknow, some length, width, size, asymmetry, etc. Now we're going to use all these properties to\nhelp us discriminate the patterns and whether or not they came from a gamma particle or hadron.\nSo in order to do this, we're going to come up here, go to the data folder. And you're going\nto click this magic zero for data, and we're going to download that. Now over here, I have a colab\nnotebook open. So you go to colab dot research dot google.com, you start a new notebook. And\nI'm just going to call this the magic data set. So actually, I'm going to call this for code camp\nmagic example. Okay. So with that, I'm going to first start with some imports. So I will import,\nyou know, I always import NumPy, I always import pandas. And I always import matplotlib.\nAnd then we'll import other things as we go. So yeah,\nwe run that in order to run the cell, you can either click this play button here, or you can\non my computer, it's just shift enter and that that will run the cell. And here, I'm just going\nto order I'm just going to, you know, let you guys know, okay, this is where I found the data set.\nSo I've copied and pasted this actually, but this is just where I found the data set.\nAnd in order to import that downloaded file that we we got from the computer, we're going to go\nover here to this folder thing. And I am literally just going to drag and drop that file into here.\nOkay. So in order to take a look at, you know, what does this file consist of,\ndo we have the labels? Do we not? I mean, we could open it on our computer, but we can also just do\npandas read CSV. And we can pass in the name of this file.\nAnd let's see what it returns. So it doesn't seem like we have the label. So let's go back to here.\nI'm just going to make the columns, the column labels, all of these attribute names over here.\nSo I'm just going to take these values and make that the column names.\nAll right, how do I do that? So basically, I will come back here, and I will create a list called\ncalls. And I will type in all of those things. With f size, f conk. And we also have f conk one.\nWe have f symmetry, f m three long, f m three trans, f alpha. Let's see, we have f dist and class.\nOkay, great. Now in order to label those as these columns down here in our data frame.\nSo basically, this command here just reads some CSV file that you pass in CSV has come about comma\nseparated values, and turns that into a pandas data frame object. So now if I pass in a names here,\nthen it basically assigns these labels to the columns of this data set. So I'm going to set\nthis data frame equal to DF. And then if we call the head is just like, give me the first five things,\ngive me the first five things. Now you'll see that we have labels for all of these. Okay.\nAll right, great. So one thing that you might notice is that over here, the class labels,\nwe have G and H. So if I actually go down here, and I do data frame class unique,\nyou'll see that I have either G's or H's, and these stand for gammas or hadrons.\nAnd our computer is not so good at understanding letters, right? Our computer is really good at\nunderstanding numbers. So what we're going to do is we're going to convert this to zero for G and\none for H. So here, I'm going to set this equal to this, whether or not that equals G. And then\nI'm just going to say as type int. So what this should do is convert this entire column,\nif it equals G, then this is true. So I guess that would be one. And then if it's H, it would\nbe false. So that would be zero, but I'm just converting G and H to one and zero, it doesn't\nreally matter. Like, if G is one and H is zero or vice versa. Let me just take a step back right\nnow and talk about this data set. So here I have some data frame, and I have all of these different\nvalues for each entry. Now this is a you know, each of these is one sample, it's one example,\nit's one item in our data set, it's one data point, all of these things are kind of the same\nthing when I mentioned, oh, this is one example, or this is one sample or whatever. Now, each of\nthese samples, they have, you know, one quality for each or one value for each of these labels\nup here, and then it has the class. Now what we're going to do in this specific example is try to\npredict for future, you know, samples, whether the class is G for gamma or H for hadron. And\nthat is something known as classification. Now, all of these up here, these are known as our features,\nand features are just things that we're going to pass into our model in order to help us predict\nthe label, which in this case is the class column. So for you know, sample zero, I have\n10 different features. So I have 10 different values that I can pass into some model.\nAnd I can spit out, you know, the class the label, and I know the true label here is G. So this is\nthis is actually supervised learning. All right. So before I move on, let me just give you a quick\nlittle crash course on what I just said. This is machine learning for everyone. Well, the first\nquestion is, what is machine learning? Well, machine learning is a sub domain of computer science\nthat focuses on certain algorithms, which might help a computer learn from data, without a\nprogrammer being there telling the computer exactly what to do. That's what we call explicit\nprogramming. So you might have heard of AI and ML and data science, what is the difference between\nall of these. So AI is artificial intelligence. And that's an area of computer science, where the\ngoal is to enable computers and machines to perform human like tasks and simulate human behavior.\nNow machine learning is a subset of AI that tries to solve one specific problem and make predictions\nusing certain data. And data science is a field that attempts to find patterns and draw insights\nfrom data. And that might mean we're using machine learning. So all of these fields kind of overlap,\nand all of them might use machine learning. So there are a few types of machine learning.\nThe first one is supervised learning. And in supervised learning, we're using labeled inputs.\nSo this means whatever input we get, we have a corresponding output label, in order to train\nmodels and to learn outputs of different new inputs that we might feed our model. So for example,\nI might have these pictures, okay, to a computer, all these pictures are are pixels, they're pixels\nwith a certain color. Now in supervised learning, all of these inputs have a label associated with\nthem, this is the output that we might want the computer to be able to predict. So for example,\nover here, this picture is a cat, this picture is a dog, and this picture is a lizard.\nNow there's also unsupervised learning. And in unsupervised learning, we use unlabeled data\nto learn about patterns in the data. So here are here are my input data points. Again, they're just\nimages, they're just pixels. Well, okay, let's say I have a bunch of these different pictures.\nAnd what I can do is I can feed all these to my computer. And I might not, you know,\nmy computer is not going to be able to say, Oh, this is a cat, dog and lizard in terms of,\nyou know, the output. But it might be able to cluster all these pictures, it might say,\nHey, all of these have something in common. All of these have something in common. And then these\ndown here have something in common, that's finding some sort of structure in our unlabeled data.\nAnd finally, we have reinforcement learning. And reinforcement learning. Well, they usually\nthere's an agent that is learning in some sort of interactive environment, based on rewards and\npenalties. So let's think of a dog, we can train our dog, but there's not necessarily, you know,\nany wrong or right output at any given moment, right? Well, let's pretend that dog is a computer.\nEssentially, what we're doing is we're giving rewards to our computer, and tell your computer,\nHey, this is probably something good that you want to keep doing. Well, computer agent terminology.\nBut in this class today, we'll be focusing on supervised learning and unsupervised learning\nand learning different models for each of those. Alright, so let's talk about supervised learning\nfirst. So this is kind of what a machine learning model looks like you have a bunch of inputs\nthat are going into some model. And then the model is spitting out an output, which is our prediction.\nSo all these inputs, this is what we call the feature vector. Now there are different types\nof features that we can have, we might have qualitative features. And qualitative means\ncategorical data, there's either a finite number of categories or groups. So one example of a\nqualitative feature might be gender. And in this case, there's only two here, it's for the sake of\nthe example, I know this might be a little bit outdated. Here we have a girl and a boy, there are\ntwo genders, there are two different categories. That's a piece of qualitative data. Another\nexample might be okay, we have, you know, a bunch of different nationalities, maybe a nationality or\na nation or a location, that might also be an example of categorical data. Now, in both of\nthese, there's no inherent order. It's not like, you know, we can rate us one and France to Japan\nthree, etc. Right? There's not really any inherent order built into either of these categorical\ndata sets. That's why we call this nominal data. Now, for nominal data, the way that we want\nto feed it into our computer is using something called one hot encoding. So let's say that, you\nknow, I have a data set, some of the items in our data, some of the inputs might be from the US,\nsome might be from India, then Canada, then France. Now, how do we get our computer to recognize that\nwe have to do something called one hot encoding. And basically, one hot encoding is saying, okay,\nwell, if it matches some category, make that a one. And if it doesn't just make that a zero.\nSo for example, if your input were from the US, you would you might have 1000. India, you know,\n0100. Canada, okay, well, the item representing Canada is one and then France, the item representing\nFrance is one. And then you can see that the rest are zeros, that's one hot encoding.\nNow, there are also a different type of qualitative feature. So here on the left,\nthere are different age groups, there's babies, toddlers, teenagers, young adults,\nadults, and so on, right. And on the right hand side, we might have different ratings. So maybe\nbad, not so good, mediocre, good, and then like, great. Now, these are known as ordinal pieces of\ndata, because they have some sort of inherent order, right? Like, being a toddler is a lot closer to\nbeing a baby than being an elderly person, right? Or good is closer to great than it is to really\nbad. So these have some sort of inherent ordering system. And so for these types of data sets,\nwe can actually just mark them from, you know, one to five, or we can just say, hey, for each of these,\nlet's give it a number. And this makes sense. Because, like, for example, the thing that I\njust said, how good is closer to great, then good is close to not good at all. Well, four is closer\nto five, then four is close to one. So this actually kind of makes sense. And it'll make sense for the\ncomputer as well. Alright, there are also quantitative pieces of data and quantitative\npieces of data are numerical valued pieces of data. So this could be discrete, which means,\nyou know, they might be integers, or it could be continuous, which means all real numbers.\nSo for example, the length of something is a quantitative piece of data, it's a quantitative\nfeature, the temperature of something is a quantitative feature. And then maybe how many\nEaster eggs I collected in my basket, this Easter egg hunt, that is an example of discrete quantitative\nfeature. Okay, so these are continuous. And this over here is the screen. So those are the things\nthat go into our feature vector, those are our features that we're feeding this model, because\nour computers are really, really good at understanding math, right at understanding numbers,\nthey're not so good at understanding things that humans might be able to understand.\nWell, what are the types of predictions that our model can output? So in supervised learning,\nthere are some different tasks, there's one classification, and basically classification,\njust saying, okay, predict discrete classes. And that might mean, you know, this is a hot dog,\nthis is a pizza, and this is ice cream. Okay, so there are three distinct classes and any other\npictures of hot dogs, pizza or ice cream, I can put under these labels. Hot dog, pizza, ice cream.\nHot dog, pizza, ice cream. This is something known as multi class classification. But there's also\nbinary classification. And binary classification, you might have hot dog, or not hot dog. So there's\nonly two categories that you're working with something that is something and something that's\nisn't binary classification. Okay, so yeah, other examples. So if something has positive or negative\nsentiment, that's binary classification. Maybe you're predicting your pictures of their cats or\ndogs. That's binary classification. Maybe, you know, you are writing an email filter, and you're\ntrying to figure out if an email spam or not spam. So that's also binary classification.\nNow for multi class classification, you might have, you know, cat, dog, lizard, dolphin, shark,\nrabbit, etc. We might have different types of fruits like orange, apple, pear, etc. And then\nmaybe different plant species. But multi class classification just means more than two. Okay,\nand binary means we're predicting between two things. There's also something called regression\nwhen we talk about supervised learning. And this just means we're trying to predict continuous\nvalues. So instead of just trying to predict different categories, we're trying to come up\nwith a number that you know, is on some sort of scale. So some examples. So some examples might\nbe the price of aetherium tomorrow, or it might be okay, what is going to be the temperature?\nOr it might be what is the price of this house? Right? So these things don't really fit into\ndiscrete classes. We're trying to predict a number that's as close to the true value as possible\nusing different features of our data set. So that's exactly what our model looks like in\nsupervised learning. Now let's talk about the model itself. How do we make this model learn?\nOr how can we tell whether or not it's even learning? So before we talk about the models,\nlet's talk about how can we actually like evaluate these models? Or how can we tell\nwhether something is a good model or bad model? So let's take a look at this data set. So this data\nset has this is from a diabetes, a Pima Indian diabetes data set. And here we have different\nnumber of pregnancies, different glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI,\nage, and then the outcome whether or not they have diabetes one for they do zero for they don't.\nSo here, all of these are quantitative features, right, because they're all on some scale.\nSo each row is a different sample in the data. So it's a different example, it's one person's data,\nand each row represents one person in this data set. Now this column, each column represents a\ndifferent feature. So this one here is some measure of blood pressure levels. And this one\nover here, as we mentioned is the output label. So this one is whether or not they have diabetes.\nAnd as I mentioned, this is what we would call a feature vector, because these are all of our\nfeatures in one sample. And this is what's known as the target, or the output for that feature\nvector. That's what we're trying to predict. And all of these together is our features matrix x.\nAnd over here, this is our labels or targets vector y. So I've condensed this to a chocolate\nbar to kind of talk about some of the other concepts in machine learning. So over here,\nwe have our x, our features matrix, and over here, this is our label y. So each row of this\nwill be fed into our model, right. And our model will make some sort of prediction. And what we do\nis we compare that prediction to the actual value of y that we have in our label data set, because\nthat's the whole point of supervised learning is we can compare what our model is outputting to,\noh, what is the truth, actually, and then we can go back and we can adjust some things. So the next\niteration, we get closer to what the true value is. So that whole process here, the tinkering that,\nokay, what's the difference? Where did we go wrong? That's what's known as training the model.\nAlright, so take this whole, you know, chunk right here, do we want to really put our entire\nchocolate bar into the model to train our model? Not really, right? Because if we did that, then\nhow do we know that our model can do well on new data that we haven't seen? Like, if I were to\ncreate a model to predict whether or not someone has diabetes, let's say that I just train all my\ndata, and I see that all my training data does well, I go to some hospital, I'm like, here's my\nmodel. I think you can use this to predict if somebody has diabetes. Do we think that would\nbe effective or not? Probably not, right? Because we haven't assessed how well our model can\ngeneralize. Okay, it might do well after you know, our model has seen this data over and over and\nover again. But what about new data? Can our model handle new data? Well, how do we how do we get our\nmodel to assess that? So we actually break up our whole data set that we have into three different\ntypes of data sets, we call it the training data set, the validation data set and the testing data\nset. And you know, you might have 60% here 20% and 20% or 80 10 and 10. It really depends on how\nmany statistics you have, I think either of those would be acceptable. So what we do is then we feed\nthe training data set into our model, we come up with, you know, this might be a vector of predictions\ncorresponding with each sample that we put into our model, we figure out, okay, what's the difference\nbetween our prediction and the true values, this is something known as loss, losses, you know,\nwhat's the difference here, in some numerical quantity, of course. And then we make adjustments,\nand that's what we call training. Okay. So then, once you know, we've made a bunch of adjustments,\nwe can put our validation set through this model. And the validation set is kind of used as a reality\ncheck during or after training to ensure that the model can handle unseen data still. So every\nsingle time after we train one iteration, we might stick the validation set in and see, hey, what's\nthe loss there. And then after our training is over, we can assess the validation set and ask,\nhey, what's the loss there. But one key difference here is that we don't have that training step,\nthis loss never gets fed back into the model, right, that feedback loop is not closed.\nAlright, so let's talk about loss really quickly. So here, I have four different types of models,\nI have some sort of data that's being fed into the model, and then some output. Okay, so this output\nhere is pretty far from you know, this truth that we want. And so this loss is going to be high. In\nmodel B, again, this is pretty far from what we want. So this loss is also going to be high,\nlet's give it 1.5. Now this one here, it's pretty close, I mean, maybe not almost, but pretty close\nto this one. So that might have a loss of 0.5. And then this one here is maybe further than this,\nbut still better than these two. So that loss might be 0.9. Okay, so which of these model\nperforms the best? Well, model C has a smallest loss, so it's probably model C. Okay, now let's\ntake model C. After you know, we've come up with these, all these models, and we've seen, okay, model\nC is probably the best model. We take model C, and we run our test set through this model. And this\ntest set is used as a final check to see how generalizable that chosen model is. So if I,\nyou know, finish training my diabetes data set, then I could run it through some chunk of the\ndata and I can say, oh, like, this is how we perform on data that it's never seen before at\nany point during the training process. Okay. And that loss, that's the final reported performance\nof my test set, or this would be the final reported performance of my model. Okay.\nSo let's talk about this thing called loss, because I think I kind of just glossed over it,\nright? So loss is the difference between your prediction and the actual, like, label.\nSo this would give a slightly higher loss than this. And this would even give a higher loss,\nbecause it's even more off. In computer science, we like formulas, right? We like formulaic ways\nof describing things. So here are some examples of loss functions and how we can actually come\nup with numbers. This here is known as L one loss. And basically, L one loss just takes the\nabsolute value of whatever your you know, real value is, whatever the real output label is,\nsubtracts the predicted value, and takes the absolute value of that. Okay. So the absolute\nvalue is a function that looks something like this. So the further off you are, the greater your losses,\nright in either direction. So if your real value is off from your predicted value by 10,\nthen your loss for that point would be 10. And then this sum here just means, hey,\nwe're taking all the points in our data set. And we're trying to figure out the sum of how far\neverything is. Now, we also have something called L two loss. So this loss function is quadratic,\nwhich means that if it's close, the penalty is very minimal. And if it's off by a lot,\nthen the penalty is much, much higher. Okay. And this instead of the absolute value, we just square\nthe the difference between the two. Now, there's also something called binary cross entropy loss.\nIt looks something like this. And this is for binary classification, this this might be the\nloss that we use. So this loss, you know, I'm not going to really go through it too much.\nBut you just need to know that loss decreases as the performance gets better. So there are some\nother measures of accurate or performance as well. So for example, accuracy, what is accuracy?\nSo let's say that these are pictures that I'm feeding my model, okay. And these predictions\nmight be apple, orange, orange, apple, okay, but the actual is apple, orange, apple, apple. So\nthree of them were correct. And one of them was incorrect. So the accuracy of this model is\nthree quarters or 75%. Alright, coming back to our colab notebook, I'm going to close this a little\nbit. Again, we've imported stuff up here. And we've already created our data frame right here. And\nthis is this is all of our data. This is what we're going to use to train our models. So down here,\nagain, if we now take a look at our data set, you'll see that our classes are now zeros and ones.\nSo now this is all numerical, which is good, because our computer can now understand that.\nOkay. And you know, it would probably be a good idea to maybe kind of plot, hey, do these things\nhave anything to do with the class. So here, I'm going to go through all the labels. So for label\nin the columns of this data frame. So this just gets me the list. Actually, we have the list,\nright? It's called so let's just use that might be less confusing of everything up to the last\nthing, which is the class. So I'm going to take all these 10 different features. And I'm going\nto plot them as a histogram. So and now I'm going to plot them as a histogram. So basically, if I\ntake that data frame, and I say, okay, for everything where the class is equal to one, so these are all\nof our gammas, remember, now, for that portion of the data frame, if I look at this label, so now\nthese, okay, what this part here is saying is, inside the data frame, get me everything where\nthe class is equal to one. So that's all all of these would fit into that category, right?\nAnd now let's just look at the label column. So the first label would be f length, which would\nbe this column. So this command here is getting me all the different values that belong to class one\nfor this specific label. And that's exactly what I'm going to put into the histogram. And now I'm\njust going to tell you know, matplotlib make the color blue, make this label this as you know, gamma\nset alpha, why do I keep doing that, alpha equal to 0.7. So that's just like the transparency.\nAnd then I'm going to set density equal to true, so that when we compare it to\nthe hadrons here, we'll have a baseline for comparing them. Okay, so the density being true\njust basically normalizes these distributions. So you know, if you have 200 in of one type,\nand then 50 of another type, well, if you drew the histograms, it would be hard to compare because\none of them would be a lot bigger than the other, right. But by normalizing them, we kind of are\ndistributing them over how many samples there are. Alright, and then I'm just going to put a title\non here and make that the label, the y label. So because it's density, the y label is probability.\nAnd the x label is just going to be the label.\nWhat is going on. And I'm going to include a legend and PLT dot show just means okay, display\nthe plot. So if I run that, just be up to the last item. So we want a list, right, not just the last\nitem. And now we can see that we're plotting all of these. So here we have the length. Oh, and I\nmade this gamma. So this should be hadron. Okay, so the gammas in blue, the hadrons are in red. So\nhere we can already see that, you know, maybe if the length is smaller, it's probably more likely\nto be gamma, right. And we can kind of you know, these all look somewhat similar. But here, okay,\nclearly, if there's more asymmetry, or if you know, this asymmetry measure is larger, then it's\nprobably hadron. Okay, oh, this one's a good one. So f alpha seems like hadrons are pretty evenly\ndistributed. Whereas if this is smaller, it looks like there's more gammas in that area.\nOkay, so this is kind of what the data that we're working with, we can kind of see what's going on.\nOkay, so the next thing that we're going to do here is we are going to create our train,\nour validation, and our test data sets. I'm going to set train valid and test to be equal to\nthis. So NumPy dot split, I'm just splitting up the data frame. And if I do this sample,\nwhere I'm sampling everything, this will basically shuffle my data. Now, if I I want to pass in where\nexactly I'm splitting my data set, so the first split is going to be maybe at 60%. So I'm going\nto say 0.6 times the length of this data frame. So and then cast that 10 integer, that's going\nto be the first place where you know, I cut it off, and that'll be my training data. Now, if I\nthen go to 0.8, this basically means everything between 60% and 80% of the length of the data\nset will go towards validation. And then, like everything from 80 to 100, I'm going to pass\nmy test data. So I can run that. And now, if we go up here, and we inspect this data, we'll see that\nthese columns seem to have values in like the 100s, whereas this one is 0.03. Right? So the scale of\nall these numbers is way off. And sometimes that will affect our results. So I'm going to run this\nis way off. And sometimes that will affect our results. So one thing that we would want to do\nis scale these so that they are, you know, so that it's now relative to maybe the mean and the\nstandard deviation of that specific column. I'm going to create a function called scale data set.\nAnd I'm going to pass in the data frame. And that's what I'll do for now. Okay, so the x values are\ngoing to be, you know, I take the data frame. And let's assume that the columns are going to be,\nyou know, that the label will always be the last thing in the data frame. So what I can do is say\ndata frame, dot columns all the way up to the last item, and get those values. Now for my y,\nwell, it's the last column. So I can just do this, I can just index into that last column,\nand then get those values. Now, in, so I'm actually going to import something known as\nthe standard scalar from sk learn. So if I come up here, I can go to sk learn dot pre processing.\nAnd I'm going to import standard scalar, I have to run that cell, I'm going to come back down here.\nAnd now I'm going to create a scalar and use that skip or so standard scalar.\nAnd with the scalar, what I can do is actually just fit and transform x. So here, I can say x\nis equal to scalar dot fit, fit, transform x. So what that's doing is saying, okay, take x and\nfit the standard scalar to x, and then transform all those values. And what would it be? And that's\ngoing to be our new x. Alright. And then I'm also going to just create, you know, the whole data as\none huge 2d NumPy array. And in order to do that, I'm going to call H stack. So H stack is saying,\nokay, take an array, and another array and horizontally stack them together. That's what\nthe H stands for. So by horizontally stacked them together, just like put them side by side,\nokay, not on top of each other. So what am I stacking? Well, I have to pass in something\nso that it can stack x and y. And now, okay, so NumPy is very particular about dimensions,\nright? So in this specific case, our x is a two dimensional object, but y is only a one dimensional\nthing, it's only a vector of values. So in order to now reshape it into a 2d item, we have to call\nNumPy dot reshape. And we can pass in the dimensions of its reshape. So if I pass in negative\none comma one, that just means okay, make this a 2d array, where the negative one just means infer\nwhat what this dimension value would be, which ends up being the length of y, this would be the\nsame as literally doing this. But the negative one is easier because we're making the computer\ndo the hard work. So if I stack that, I'm going to then return the data x and y. Okay. So one more\nthing is that if we go into our training data set, okay, again, this is our training data set.\nAnd we get the length of the training data set. But where the training data sets class is one,\nso remember that this is the gammas. And then if we print that, and we do the same thing, but zero,\nwe'll see that, you know, there's around 7000 of the gammas, but only around 4000 of the hadrons.\nSo that might actually become an issue. And instead, what we want to do is we want to oversample\nour our training data set. So that means that we want to increase the number of these values,\nso that these kind of match better. And surprise, surprise, there is something that we can import\nthat will help us do that. It's so I'm going to go to from in the learn dot oversampling. And I'm\ngoing to import this random oversampler, run that cell, and come back down here. So I will actually\nadd in this parameter called oversample, and set that to false for default. And if I do want to\noversample, then what I'm going to do, and by oversample, so if I do want to oversample,\nthen I'm going to create this ROS and set it equal to this random oversampler. And then for x and y,\nI'm just going to say, okay, just fit and resample x and y. And what that's doing is saying, okay,\ntake more of the less class. So take take the less class and keep sampling from there to increase\nthe size of our data set of that smaller class so that they now match. So if I do this, and I scale\ndata set, and I pass in the training data set where oversample is true. So this let's say this\nis train and then x train, y train. Oops, what's going on? These should be columns. So basically,\nwhat I'm doing now is I'm just saying, okay, what is the length of y train? Okay, now it's\n14,800, whatever. And now let's take a look at how many of these are type one. So actually,\nwe can just sum that up. And then we'll also see that if we instead switch the label and ask how\nmany of them are the other type, it's the same value. So now these have been evenly, you know,\nrebalanced. Okay, well, okay. So here, I'm just going to make this the validation data set. And\nthen the next one, I'm going to make this the test data set. Alright, and we're actually going to\nswitch oversample here to false. Now, the reason why I'm switching that to false is because my\nvalidation and my test sets are for the purpose of you know, if I have data that I haven't seen yet,\nhow does my sample perform on those? And I don't want to oversample for that right now. Like,\nI don't care about balancing those I'm, I want to know if I have a random set of data that's\nunlabeled, can I trust my model, right? So that's why I'm not oversampling. I run that. And again,\nwhat is going on? Oh, it's because we already have this train. So I have to go come up here and split\nthat data frame again. And now let's run these. Okay. So now we have our data properly formatted.\nAnd we're going to move on to different models now. And I'm going to tell you guys a little bit\nabout each of these models. And then I'm going to show you how we can do that in our code. So the\nfirst model that we're going to learn about is KNN or K nearest neighbors. Okay, so here, I've\nalready drawn a plot on the y axis, I have the number of kids that a family might have. And then\non the x axis, I have their income in terms of 1000s per year. So, you know, if if someone's\nmaking 40,000 a year, that's where this would be. And if somebody making 320, that's where that\nwould be somebody has zero kids, it'd be somewhere along this axis. Somebody has five, it'd be\nsomewhere over here. Okay. And now I have these plus signs and these minus signs on here. So what\nI'm going to represent here is the plus sign means that they own a car. And the minus sign is going\nto represent no car. Okay. So your initial thought should be okay, I think this is binary\nclassification because all of our points all of our samples have labels. So this is a sample with\nthe plus label. And this here is another sample with the minus label. This is an abbreviation for\nwidth that I'll use. Alright, so we have this entire data set. And maybe around half the people\nown a car and maybe around half the people don't own a car. Okay, well, what if I had some new\npoint, let me use choose a different color, I'll use this nice green. Well, what if I have a new\npoint over here? So let's say that somebody makes 40,000 a year and has two kids. What do we think\nthat would be? Well, just logically looking at this plot, you might think, okay, it seems like\nthey wouldn't have a car, right? Because that kind of matches the pattern of everybody else around\nthem. So that's a whole concept of this nearest neighbors is you look at, okay, what's around you.\nAnd then you're basically like, okay, I'm going to take the label of the majority that's around me.\nSo the first thing that we have to do is we have to define a distance function. And a lot of times\nin, you know, 2d plots like this, our distance function is something known as Euclidean distance.\nAnd Euclidean distance is basically just this straight line distance like this. Okay. So this\nwould be the Euclidean distance, it seems like there's this point, there's this point, there's\nthat point, etc. So the length of this line, this green line that I just drew, that is what's known\nas Euclidean distance. If we want to get technical with that, this exact formula is the distance here,\nlet me zoom in. The distance is equal to the square root of one point x minus the other points x\nsquared plus extend that square root, the same thing for y. So y one of one minus y two of the\nother squared. Okay, so we're basically trying to find the length, the distances, the difference\nbetween x and y, and then square each of those sum it up and take the square root. Okay, so I'm\ngoing to erase this so it doesn't clutter my drawing. But anyways, now going back to this plot,\nso here in the nearest neighbor algorithm, we see that there is a K, right? And this K is basically\ntelling us, okay, how many neighbors do we use in order to judge what the label is? So usually,\nwe use a K of maybe, you know, three or five, depends on how big our data set is. But here,\nI would say, maybe a logical number would be three or five. So let's say that we take K to be equal\nto three. Okay, well, of this data point that I drew over here, let me use green to highlight this.\nOkay, so of this data point that I drew over here, it looks like the three closest points are definitely\nthis one, this one. And then this one has a length of four. And this one seems like it'd be a little\nbit further than four. So actually, this would be these would be our three points. Well, all those\npoints are blue. So chances are, my prediction for this point is going to be blue, it's going to be\nprobably don't have a car. All right, now what if my point is somewhere? What if my point is\nsomewhere over here, let's say that a couple has four kids, and they make 240,000 a year. All right,\nwell, now my closest points are this one, probably a little bit over that one. And then this one,\nright? Okay, still all pluses. Well, this one is more than likely to be plus. Right? Now,\nlet me get rid of some of these just so that it looks a little bit more clear. All right,\nlet's go through one more. What about a point that might be right here? Okay, let's see. Well,\ndefinitely this is the closest, right? This one's also closest. And then it's really close between\nthe two of these. But if we actually do the mathematics, it seems like if we zoom in,\nthis one is right here. And this one is in between these two. So this one here is actually shorter\nthan this one. And that means that that top one is the one that we're going to take. Now,\nwhat is the majority of the points that are close by? Well, we have one plus here, we have one plus\nhere, and we have one minus here, which means that the pluses are the majority. And that means\nthat this label is probably somebody with a car. Okay. So this is how K nearest neighbors would\nwork. It's that simple. And this can be extrapolated to further dimensions to higher dimensions. You\nknow, if you have here, we have two different features, we have the income, and then we have\nthe number of kids. But let's say we have 10 different features, we can expand our distance\nfunction so that it includes all 10 of those dimensions, we take the square root of everything,\nand then we figure out which one is the closest to the point that we desire to classify. Okay. So\nthat's K nearest neighbors. So now we've learned about K nearest neighbors. Let's see how we would\nbe able to do that within our code. So here, I'm going to label the section K nearest neighbors.\nAnd we're actually going to use a package from SK learn. So the reason why we, you know, use these\npackages and so that we don't have to manually code all these things ourselves, because it would\nbe really difficult. And chances are the way that we would code it, either would have bugs,\nor it'd be really slow, or I don't know a whole bunch of issues. So what we're going to do is\nhand it off to the pros. From here, I can say, okay, from SK learn, which is this package dot\nneighbors, I'm going to import K neighbors classifier, because we're classifying. Okay,\nso I run that. And our KNN model is going to be this K neighbors classifier. And we can pass in\na parameter of how many neighbors, you know, we want to use. So first, let's see what happens if\nwe just use one. So now if I do K, and then model dot fit, I can pass in my x training set and my\nweight y train data. Okay. So that effectively fits this model. And let's get all the predictions. So\nwhy can and I guess yeah, let's do y predictions. And my y predictions are going to be cannon model\ndot predict. So let's use the test set x test. Okay. Alright, so if I call y predict, you'll see\nthat we have those. But if I get my truth values for that test set, you'll see that this is what\nwe actually do. So just looking at this, we got five out of six of them. Okay, great. So let's\nactually take a look at something called the classification report that's offered by SK learn.\nSo if I go to from SK learn dot metrics, import classification report, what I can actually do is\nsay, hey, print out this classification report for me. And let's check, you know, I'm giving you the\ny test and the y prediction. We run this and we see we get this whole entire chart. So I'm going\nto tell you guys a few things on this chart. Alright, this accuracy is 82%, which is actually\npretty good. That's just saying, hey, if we just look at, you know, what each of these new points,\nwhat it's closest to, then we actually get an 82% accuracy, which means how many do we get right\nversus how many total are there. Now, precision is saying, okay, you might see that we have it\nfor class one, or class zero and class one. What precision is saying was, let's go to this Wikipedia\ndiagram over here, because I actually kind of like this diagram. So here, this is our entire data set.\nAnd on the left over here, we have everything that we know is positive. So everything that is\nactually truly positive, that we've labeled positive in our original data set. And over here,\nthis is everything that's truly negative. Now in the circle, we have things that are positive that\nwere labeled positive by our model. On the left here, we have things that are truly positive,\nbecause you know, this side is the positive side and the side is the negative side. So these are\ntruly positive. Whereas all these ones out here, well, they should have been positive, but they\nare labeled as negative. And in here, these are the ones that we've labeled positive, but they're\nactually negative. And out here, these are truly negative. So precision is saying, okay, out of all\nthe ones we've labeled as positive, how many of them are true positives? And recall is saying,\nokay, out of all the ones that we know are truly positive, how many do we actually get right? Okay,\nso going back to this over here, our precision score, so again, precision, out of all the ones\nthat we've labeled as the specific class, how many of them are actually that class, it's 7784%. Now,\nrecall how out of all the ones that are actually this class, how many of those that we get, this\nis 68% and 89%. Alright, so not too shabby, we can clearly see that this recall and precision for\nlike this, the class zero is worse than class one. Right? So that means for hadron, it's worked for\nhadrons and for our gammas. This f1 score over here is kind of a combination of the precision and\nrecall score. So we're actually going to mostly look at this one because we have an unbalanced\ntest data set. So here we have a measure of 72 and 87 or point seven two and point eight seven,\nwhich is not too shabby. All right. Well, what if we, you know, made this three. So we actually see\nthat, okay, so what was it originally with one? We see that our f1 score, you know, is now it was\npoint seven two and then point eight seven. And then our accuracy was 82%. So if I change that to\nthree. Alright, so we've kind of increased zero at the cost of one and then our overall accuracy\nis 81. So let's actually just make this five. Alright, so you know, again, very similar numbers,\nwe have 82% accuracy, which is pretty decent for a model that's relatively simple. Okay,\nthe next type of model that we're going to talk about is something known as naive Bayes. Now,\nin order to understand the concepts behind naive Bayes, we have to be able to understand\nconditional probability and Bayes rule. So let's say I have some sort of data set that's shown in\nthis table right here. People who have COVID are over here in this red row. And people who do not\nhave COVID are down here in this green row. Now, what about the COVID test? Well, people who have\ntested positive are over here in this column. And people who have tested negative are over here in\nthis column. Okay. Yeah, so basically, our categories are people who have COVID and test positive,\npeople who don't have COVID, but test positive, so a false false positive, people who have COVID\nand test negative, which is a false negative, and people who don't have COVID and test negative,\nwhich good means you don't have COVID. Okay, so let's make this slightly more legible. And here,\nin the margins, I've written down the sums of whatever it's referring to. So this here is the\nsum of this entire row. And this here might be the sum of this column over here. Okay. So the first\nquestion that I have is, what is the probability of having COVID given that you have a positive\ntest? And in probability, we write that out like this. So the probability of COVID given, so this\nline, that vertical line means given that, you know, some condition, so given a positive test,\nokay, so what is the probability of having COVID given a positive test? So what this is asking is\nsaying, okay, let's go into this condition. So the condition of having a positive test, that is this\nslice of the data, right? That means if you're in this slice of data, you have a positive test. So\ngiven that we have a positive test, given in this condition, in this circumstance, we have a positive\ntest. So what's the probability that we have COVID? Well, if we're just using this data, the number\nof people that have COVID is 531. So I'm gonna say that there's 531 people that have COVID. And then\nnow we divide that by the total number of people that have a positive test, which is 551. Okay,\nso that's the probability and doing a quick division, we get that this is equal to around\n96.4%. So according to this data set, which is data that I made up off the top of my head, so it's\nnot actually real COVID data. But according to this data, the probability of having COVID given\nthat you tested positive is 96.4%. Alright, now with that, let's talk about Bayes rule, which is\nthis section here. Let's ignore this bottom part for now. So Bayes rule is asking, okay, what is\nthe probability of some event A happening, given that B happened. So this, we already know has\nhappened. This is our condition, right? Well, what if we don't have data for that, right? Like, what\nif we don't know what the probability of A given B is? Well, Bayes rule is saying, okay, well, you\ncan actually go and calculate it, as long as you have a probability of B given A, the probability\nof A and the probability of B. Okay. And this is just a mathematical formula for that. Alright,\nso here we have Bayes rule. And let's actually see Bayes rule in action. Let's use it on an example.\nSo here, let's say that we have some disease statistics, okay. So not COVID different disease.\nAnd we know that the probability of obtaining a false positive is 0.05 probability of obtaining a\nfalse negative is 0.01. And the probability of the disease is 0.1. Okay, what is the probability of\nthe disease given that we got a positive test? Hmm, how do we even go about solving this? So\nwhat what do I mean by false positive? What's a different way to rewrite that? A false positive\nis when you test positive, but you don't actually have the disease. So this here is a probability\nthat you have a positive test given no disease, right? And similarly for the false negative,\nit's a probability that you test negative given that you actually have the disease. So if I put\nthat into a chart, for example, and this might be my positive and negative tests, and this might\nbe my diseases, disease and no disease. Well, the probability that I test positive, but actually\nhave no disease, okay, that's 0.05 over here. And then the false negatives up here for 0.01. So I'm\ntesting negative, but I don't actually have the disease. This so the probability that you test\npositive, and you don't have the disease, plus a probability that you test negative, given that you\ndon't have the disease, that should sum up to one. Okay, because if you don't have the disease,\nthen you should have some probability that you're testing positive and some probability that you're\ntesting negative. But that probability, in total should be one. So that means that the probability\nnegative and no disease, this should be the reciprocal, this should be the opposite. So it\nshould be 0.95 because it's one minus whatever this probability is. And then similarly, oops,\nup here, this should be 0.99 because the probability that we, you know,\ntest negative and have the disease plus the probability that we test positive and have the\ndisease should equal one. So this is our probability chart. And now, this probability of disease\nbeing point 0.1 just means I have 10% probability of actually of having the disease, right? Like,\nin the general population, the probability that I have the disease is 0.1. Okay, so what is the\nprobability that I have the disease given that I got a positive test? Well, remember that we\ncan write this out in terms of Bayes rule, right? So if I use this rule up here, this is the\nprobability of a positive test given that I have the disease times the probability of the disease\ndivided by the probability of the evidence, which is my positive test.\nAlright, now let's plug in some numbers for that. The probability of having a positive test given\nthat I have the disease is 0.99. And then the probability that I have the disease is this value\nover here 0.1. Okay. And then the probability that I have a positive test at all should be okay,\nwhat is the probability that I have a positive test given that I actually have the disease\nand then having having the disease. And then the other case, where the probability of me having a\nnegative test given or sorry, positive test giving no disease times the probability of not actually\nhaving a disease. Okay, so I can expand that probability of having a positive test out into\nthese two different cases, I have a disease, and then I don't. And then what's the probability of\nhaving positive tests in either one of those cases. So that expression would become 0.99 times 0.1\nplus 0.05. So that's the probability that I'm testing positive, but don't have the disease.\nAnd the times the probability that I don't actually have the disease. So that's one minus\n0.1 probability that the population doesn't have the disease is 90%. So 0.9. And let's do that\nmultiplication. And I get an answer of 0.6875 or 68.75%. Okay. All right, so we can actually expand\nthat we can expand Bayes rule and apply it to classification. And this is what we call naive\nbase. So first, a little terminology. So the posterior is this over here, because it's asking,\nHey, what is the probability of some class CK? So by CK, I just mean, you know, the different\ncategories, so C for category or class or whatever. So category one might be cats, category two,\ndogs, category three, lizards, all the way, we have k categories, k is just some number. Okay.\nSo what is the probability of having of this specific sample x, so this is our feature vector\nof this one sample. What is the probability of x fitting into category 123 for whatever, right,\nso that that's what this is asking, what is the probability that, you know, it's actually from\nthis class, given all this evidence that we see the x's. So the likelihood is this quantity over\nhere, it's saying, Okay, well, given that, you know, assume, assume we are, assume that this\nclass is class CK, okay, assume that this is a category. Well, what is the likelihood of\nactually seeing x, all these different features from that category. And then this here is the\nprior. So like in the entire population of things, what are the probabilities? What is the\nprobability of this class in general? Like if I have, you know, in my entire data set, what is the\npercentage? What is the chance that this image is a cat? How many cats do I have? Right. And then this\ndown here is called the evidence because what we're trying to do is we're changing our prior,\nwe're creating this new posterior probability built upon the prior by using some sort of evidence,\nright? And that evidence is a probability of x. So that's some vocab. And this here\nis a rule for naive Bayes. Whoa, okay, let's digest that a little bit. Okay. So what is\nlet me use a different color. What is this side of the equation asking? It's asking,\nwhat is the probability that we are in some class K, CK, given that, you know, this is my first\ninput, this is my second input, this is, you know, my third, fourth, this is my nth input. So let's\nsay that our classification is, do we play soccer today or not? Okay, and let's say our x's are,\nokay, is it how much wind is there? How much rain is there? And what day of the week is it? So let's\nSo let's say that it's raining, it's not windy, but it's Wednesday, do we play soccer? Do we not?\nSo let's use Bayes rule on this. So this here\nis equal to the probability of x one, x two, all these joint probabilities, given class K\ntimes the probability of that class, all over the probability of this evidence.\nOkay. So what is this fancy symbol over here, this means proportional to\nso how our equal sign means it's equal to this like little squiggly sign means that this is\nproportional to okay, and this denominator over here, you might notice that it has no impact on\nthe class like this, that number doesn't depend on the class, right? So this is going to be constant\nfor all of our different classes. So what I'm going to do is make things simpler. So I'm just\ngoing to say that this probability x one, x two, all the way to x n, this is going to be proportional\nto the numerator, I don't care about the denominator, because it's the same for every\nsingle class. So this is proportional to x one, x two, x n given class K times the probability of\nthat class. Okay. All right. So in naive Bayes, the point of it being naive, is that we're actually\nthis joint probability, we're just assuming that all of these different things\nare all independent. So in my soccer example, you know, the probability that we're playing soccer,\nor the probability that, you know, it's windy, and it's rainy, and, and it's Wednesday, all these\nthings are independent, we're assuming that they're independent. So that means that I can\nactually write this part of the equation here as this. So each term in here, I can just multiply\nall of them together. So the probability of the first feature, given that it's class K,\ntimes the probability of the second feature and given this problem, like class K all the way up\nall the way up until, you know, the nth feature of given that it's class K. So this expands to\nall of this. All right, which means that this here is now proportional to the thing that we just\nexpanded times this. So I'm going to write that out. So the probability of that class.\nAnd I'm actually going to use this symbol. So what this means is it's a huge multiplication,\nit means multiply everything to the right of this. So this probability x, given some class K,\nbut do it for all the i's. So I, what is I, okay, we're going to go from the first\nthe first x i all the way to the nth. So that means for every single i, we're just multiplying\nthese probabilities together. And that's where this up here comes from. So to wrap this up,\noops, this should be a line to wrap this up in plain English. Basically, what this is saying\nis a probability that you know, we're in some category, given that we have all these different\nfeatures is proportional to the probability of that class in general, times the probability of\neach of those features, given that we're in this one class that we're testing. So the probability\nof it, you know, of us playing soccer today, given that it's rainy, not windy, and and it's\nWednesday, is proportional to Okay, well, what is what is the probability that we play soccer\nanyways, and then times the probability that it's rainy, given that we're playing soccer,\ntimes the probability that it's not windy, given that we're playing soccer. So how many times are\nwe playing soccer when it's windy, how you know, and then how many times are what's the probability\nthat's Wednesday, given that we're playing soccer. Okay. So how do we use this in order to make a\nclassification. So that's where this comes in our y hat, our predicted y is going to be equal to\nsomething called the arg max. And then this expression over here, because we want to take\nthe arg max. Well, we want. So okay, if I write out this, again, this means the probability of\nbeing in some class CK given all of our evidence. Well, we're going to take the K that maximizes\nthis expression on the right. That's what arc max means. So if K is in zero, oops,\none through K, so this is how many categories are, we're going to go through each K. And we're going\nto solve this expression over here and find the K that makes that the largest. Okay. And remember\nthat instead of writing this, we have now a formula, thanks to Bayes rule for helping us\napproximate that right in something that maybe we can we maybe we have like the evidence for that,\nwe have the answers for that based on our training set. So this principle of going through each of\nthese and finding whatever class whatever category maximizes this expression on the right,\nthis is something known as MAP for short, or maximum a posteriori.\nPick the hypothesis. So pick the K that is the most probable so that we minimize the probability\nof misclassification. Right. So that is MAP. That is naive Bayes. Back to the notebook. So\njust like how I imported k nearest neighbor, k neighbors classifier up here for naive Bayes,\nI can go to SK learn naive Bayes. And I can import Gaussian naive Bayes.\nRight. And here I'm going to say my naive Bayes model is equal. This is very similar to what we\nhad above. And I'm just going to say with this model, we are going to fit x train and y train.\nAll right, just like above. So this, I might actually, so I'm going to set that. And\nexactly, just like above, I'm going to make my prediction. So here, I'm going to instead use my\nnaive Bayes model. And of course, I'm going to run the classification report again. So I'm actually\njust going to put these in the same cell. But here we have the y the new y prediction and then y test\nis still our original test data set. So if I run this, you'll see that. Okay, what's going on here,\nwe get worse scores, right? Our precision, for all of them, they look slightly worse. And our,\nyou know, for our precision, our recall, our f1 score, they look slightly worse for all the different\ncategories. And our total accuracy, I mean, it's still 72%, which is not too shabby. But it's still\n72%. Okay. Which, you know, is not not that great. Okay, so let's move on to logistic regression.\nHere, I've drawn a plot, I have y. So this is my label on one axis. And then this is maybe one of\nmy features. So let's just say I only have one feature in this case, text zero, right? Well,\nwe see that, you know, I have a few of one class type down here. And we know it's one class type\nbecause it's zero. And then we have our other class type one up here. And then we have our\ny. Okay. So many of you guys are familiar with regression. So let's start there. If I were to\ndraw a regression line through this, it might look something like like this. Right? Well, this\ndoesn't seem to be a very good model. Like, why would we use this specific line to predict why?\nRight? It's, it's iffy. Okay. For example, we might say, okay, well, it seems like, you know,\neverything from here downwards would be one class type in here, upwards would be another class type.\nBut when you look at this, you're just you, you visually can tell, okay, like, that line doesn't\nmake sense. Things are not those dots are not along that line. And the reason is because we\nare doing classification, not regression. Okay. Well, first of all, let's start here, we know that\nthis model, if we just use this line, it equals m x. So whatever this let's just say it's x plus b,\nwhich is the y intercept, right? And m is the slope. But when we use a linear regression,\nis it actually y hat? No, it's not right. So when we're working with linear regression,\nwhat we're actually estimating in our model is a probability, what's a probability between zero\nand one, that is class zero or class one. So here, let's rewrite this as p equals m x plus b.\nOkay, well, m x plus b, that can range, you know, from negative infinity to infinity,\nright? For any for any value of x, it goes from negative infinity to infinity.\nBut probability, we know probably one of the rules of probability is that probability has to stay\nbetween zero and one. So how do we fix this? Well, maybe instead of just setting the probability\nequal to that, we can set the odds equal to this. So by that, I mean, okay, let's do probability\ndivided by one minus the probability. Okay, so now becomes this ratio. Now this ratio is allowed to\ntake on infinite values. But there's still one issue here. Let me move this over a bit.\nThe one issue here is that m x plus b, that can still be negative, right? Like if you know,\nI have a negative slope, if I have a negative b, if I have some negative x's in there, I don't know,\nbut that can be that's allowed to be negative. So how do we fix that? We do that by actually taking\nthe log of the odds. Okay. So now I have the log of you know, some probability divided by one minus\nthe probability. And now that is on a range of negative infinity to infinity, which is good\nbecause the range of log should be negative infinity to infinity. Now how do I solve for P\nthe probability? Well, the first thing I can do is take, you know, I can remove the log by taking\nthe not the e to the whatever is on both sides. So that gives me the probability\nover the one minus the probability is now equal to e to the m x plus b. Okay. So let's multiply\nthat out. So the probability is equal to one minus probability e to the m x plus b. So P is equal to\ne to the m x plus b minus P times e to the m x plus b. And now we have we can move like terms to\none side. So if I do P, so basically, I'm moving this over, so I'm adding P. So now P one plus e\nto the m x plus b is equal to e to the m x plus b and let me change this parentheses make it a\nlittle bigger. So now my probability can be e to the m x plus b divided by one plus e to the m x plus b.\nOkay, well, let me just rewrite this really quickly, I want a numerator of one on top.\nOkay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply this by negative m x plus b,\nand then also the bottom by negative m x plus b, and I'm allowed to do that because\nthis over this is one. So now my probability is equal to one over\none plus e to the negative m x plus b. And now why did I rewrite it like that?\nIt's because this is actually a form of a special function, which is called the sigmoid\nfunction. And for the sigmoid function, it looks something like this. So s of x sigmoid, you know,\nthat some x is equal to one over one plus e to the negative x. So essentially, what I just did up here\nis rewrite this in some sigmoid function, where the x value is actually m x plus b.\nSo maybe I'll change this to y just to make that a bit more clear, it doesn't matter what\nthe variable name is. But this is our sigmoid function. And visually, what our sigmoid function\nlooks like is it goes from zero. So this here is zero to one. And it looks something like this\ncurved s, which I didn't draw too well. Let me try that again. It's hard to draw\nsomething if I can draw this right. Like that. Okay, so it goes in between zero and one.\nAnd you might notice that this form fits our shape up here.\nOops, let's draw it sharper. But if it's our shape up there a lot better, right?\nAlright, so that is what we call logistic regression, we're basically trying to fit our data\nto the sigmoid function. Okay. And when we only have, you know, one data point, so if we only have\none feature x, and that's what we call simple logistic regression. But then if we have, you know,\nso that's only x zero, but then if we have x zero, x one, all the way to x n, we call this\nmultiple logistic regression, because there are multiple features that we're considering\nwhen we're building our model, logistic regression. So I'm going to put that here.\nAnd again, from SK learn this linear model, we can import logistic regression. All right.\nAnd just like how we did above, we can repeat all of this. So here, instead of NB, I'm going to call\nthis log model, or LG logistic regression. I'm going to change this to logistic regression.\nSo I'm just going to use the default logistic regression. But actually, if you look here,\nyou see that you can use different penalties. So right now we're using\nan L2 penalty. But L2 is our quadratic formula. Okay, so that means that for,\nyou know, outliers, it would really penalize that. For all these other things, you know,\nyou can toggle these different parameters, and you might get slightly different results.\nIf I were building a production level logistic regression model, then I would want to go and I\nwould want to figure out how to do that. So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and\nI would want to figure out, you know, what are the best parameters to pass into here,\nbased on my validation data. But for now, we'll just we'll just use this out of the box.\nSo again, I'm going to fit the X train and the Y train. And I'm just going to predict again,\nso I can just call this again. And instead of LG, NB, I'm going to use LG. So here, this is decent\nprecision 65% recall 71, f 168, or 82 total accuracy of 77. Okay, so it performs slightly\nbetter than I base, but it's still not as good as K and N. Alright, so the last model for\nclassification that I wanted to talk about is something called support vector machines,\nor SVMs for short. So what exactly is an SVM model, I have two different features x zero and\nx one on the axes. And then I've told you if it's you know, class zero or class one based on the\nblue and red labels, my goal is to find some sort of line between these two labels that best divides\nthe data. Alright, so this line is our SVM model. So I call it a line here because in 2d, it's a\nline, but in 3d, it would be a plane and then you can also have more and more dimensions. So the\nproper term is actually I want to find the hyperplane that best differentiates these two\nclasses. Let's see a few examples. Okay, so first, between these three lines, let's say A, B, and C,\nand C, which one is the best divider of the data, which one has you know, all the data on one side\nor the other, or at least if it doesn't, which one divides it the most, right, like which one\nis has the most defined boundary between the two different groups. So this this question should be\npretty straightforward. It should be a right because a has a clear distinct line between where you\nknow, everything on this side of a is one label, it's negative and everything on this side of a\nis the other label, it's positive. So what if I have a but then what if I had drawn my B\nlike this, and my C, maybe like this, sorry, they're kind of the labels are kind of close together.\nBut now which one is the best? So I would argue that it's still a, right? And why is it still a?\nRight? And why is it still a? Because in these other two, look at how close this is to that,\nto these points. Right? So if I had some new point that I wanted to estimate, okay,\nsay I didn't have A or B. So let's say we're just working with C. Let's say I have some new point\nthat's right here. Or maybe a new point that's right there. Well, it seems like just logically\nlooking at this. I mean, without the boundary, that would probably go under the positives,\nright? I mean, it's pretty close to that other positive. So one thing that we care about in SVM\nis something known as the margin. Okay, so not only do we want to separate the two classes really\nwell, we also care about the boundary in between where the points in those classes in our data set\nare, and the line that we're drawing. So in a line like this, the closest values to this line\nmight be like here. And I'm trying to draw these perpendicular. Right? And so this effectively,\nif I switch over to these dotted lines, if I can draw this right. So these effectively\nare what's known as the margins. Okay, so these both here, these are our margins in our SVMs.\nAnd our goal is to maximize those margins. So not only do we want the line that best separates the\ntwo different classes, we want the line that has the largest margin. And the data points that lie\non the margin lines, the data. So basically, these are the data points that's helping us define our\ndivider. These are what we call support vectors. Hence the name support vector machines. Okay,\nso the issue with SVM sometimes is that they're not so robust to outliers. Right? So for example,\nif I had one outlier, like this up here, that would totally change where I want my support\nvector to be, even though that might be my only outlier. Okay. So that's just something to keep\nin mind. As you know, when you're working with SVM is, it might not be the best model if there\nare outliers in your data set. Okay, so another example of SVMs might be, let's say that we have\ndata like this, I'm just going to use a one dimensional data set for this example. Let's\nsay we have a data set that looks like this. Well, our, you know, separators should be\nperpendicular to this line. But it should be somewhere along this line. So it could be\nanywhere like this. You might argue, okay, well, there's one here. And then you could also just\ndraw another one over here, right? And then maybe you can have two SVMs. But that's not really how\nSVMs work. But one thing that we can do is we can create some sort of projection. So I realize here\nthat one thing I forgot to do was to label where zero was. So let's just say zero is here.\nNow, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, okay, I'm going to have x, and then I'm going to\nhave x, sorry, x zero and x one. So x zero is just going to be my original x. But I'm going to make\nx one equal to let's say, x squared. So whatever is this squared, right? So now, my natives would be,\nyou know, maybe somewhere here, here, just pretend that it's somewhere up here.\nRight. And now my pluses might be something like\nthat. And I'm going to run out of space over here. So I'm just going to draw these together,\nuse your imagination. But once I draw it like this, well, it's a lot easier to apply a boundary,\nright? Now our SVM could be maybe something like this, this. And now you see that we've divided\nour data set. Now it's separable where one class is this way. And the other class is that way.\nOkay, so that's known as SVMs. I do highly suggest that, you know, any of these models that we just\nmentioned, if you're interested in them, do go more in depth mathematically into them. Like how\ndo we how do we find this hyperplane? Right? I'm not going to go over that in this specific course,\nbecause you're just learning what an SVM is. But it's a good idea to know, oh, okay, this is the\ntechnique behind finding, you know, what exactly are the are the how do you define the hyperplane\nthat we're going to use. So anyways, this transformation that we did down here, this is known\nas the kernel trick. So when we go from x to some coordinate x, and then x squared,\nwhat we're doing is we are applying a kernel. So that's why it's called the kernel trick.\nSo SVMs are actually really powerful. And you'll see that here. So from sk learn.svm, we are going\nto import SVC. And SVC is our support vector classifier. So with this, so with our SVM model,\nwe are going to, you know, create SVC model. And we are going to, again, fit this to X train, I\ncould have just copied and pasted this, I should be able to do that. So we're going to create SVC\nagain, fit this to X train, I could have just copied and pasted this, I should have probably\ndone that. Okay, taking a bit longer. All right. Let's predict using RSVM model. And here,\nlet's see if I can hover over this. Right. So again, you see a lot of these different\nparameters here that you can go back and change if you were creating a production level model. Okay,\nbut in this specific case, we'll just use it out of the box again. So if I make predictions,\nyou'll note that Wow, the accuracy actually jumps to 87% with the SVM. And even with class zero,\nthere's nothing less than, you know, point eight, which is great. And for class one,\nI mean, everything's at 0.9, which is higher than anything that we had seen to this point.\nSo so far, we've gone over four different classification models, we've done SVM,\nlogistic regression, naive Bayes and cannon. And these are just simple ways on how to implement\nthem. Each of these they have different, you know, they have different hyper parameters that you can\ngo and you can toggle. And you can try to see if that helps later on or not. But for the most part,\nthey perform, they give us around 70 to 80% accuracy. Okay, with SVM being the best. Now,\nlet's see if we can actually beat that using a neural net. Now the final type of model that\nI wanted to talk about is known as a neural net or neural network. And neural nets look something\nlike this. So you have an input layer, this is where all your features would go. And they have\nall these arrows pointing to some sort of hidden layer. And then all these arrows point to some\nsort of output layer. So what is what is all this mean? Each of these layers in here, this is\nsomething known as a neuron. Okay, so that's a neuron. In a neural net. These are all of our\nfeatures that we're inputting into the neural net. So that might be x zero x one all the way through\nx n. Right. And these are the features that we talked about there, they might be you know,\nthe pregnancy, the BMI, the age, etc. Now all of these get weighted by some value. So they\nare multiplied by some w number that applies to that one specific category that one specific\nfeature. So these two get multiplied. And the sum of all of these goes into that neuron. Okay,\nso basically, I'm taking w zero times x zero. And then I'm adding x one times w one and then\nI'm adding you know, x two times w two, etc, all the way to x n times w n. And that's getting\ninput into the neuron. Now I'm also adding this bias term, which just means okay, I might want\nto shift this by a little bit. So I might add five or I might add 0.1 or I might subtract 100,\nI don't know. But we're going to add this bias term. And the output of all these things. So\nthe sum of this, this, this and this, go into something known as an activation function,\nokay. And then after applying this activation function, we get an output. And this is what a\nneuron would look like. Now a whole network of them would look something like this.\nSo I kind of gloss over this activation function. What exactly is that? This is how a neural net\nlooks like if we have all our inputs here. And let's say all of these arrows represent some sort\nof addition, right? Then what's going on is we're just adding a bunch of times, right? We're adding\nthe some sort of weight times these input layer a bunch of times. And then if we were to go back\nand factor that all out, then this entire neural net is just a linear combination of these input\nlayers, which I don't know about you, but that just seems kind of useless, right? Because we could\nliterally just write that out in a formula, why would we need to set up this entire neural network,\nwe wouldn't. So the activation function is introduced, right? So without an activation\nfunction, this just becomes a linear model. An activation function might look something like\nthis. And as you can tell, these are not linear. And the reason why we introduce these is so that\nour entire model doesn't collapse on itself and become a linear model. So over here, this is\nsomething known as a sigmoid function, it runs between zero and one, tanh runs between negative\none all the way to one. And this is ReLU, which anything less than zero is zero, and then anything\ngreater than zero is linear. So with these activation functions, every single output of a neuron\nis no longer just the linear combination of these, it's some sort of altered linear state, which means\nthat the input into the next neuron is, you know, it doesn't it doesn't collapse on itself, it doesn't\nbecome linear, because we've introduced all these nonlinearities. So this is a training set, the\nmodel, the loss, right? And then we do this thing called training, where we have to feed the loss\nback into the model, and make certain adjustments to the model to improve this predicted output.\nLet's talk a little bit about the training, what exactly goes on during that step.\nLet's go back and take a look at our L2 loss function. This is what our L2 loss function\nlooks like it's a quadratic formula, right? Well, up here, the error is really, really, really, really\nlarge. And our goal is to get somewhere down here, where the loss is decreased, right? Because that\nmeans that our predicted value is closer to our true value. So that means that we want to go\nthis way. Okay. And thanks to a lot of properties of math, something that we can do is called\ngradient descent, in order to follow this slope down this way. This quadratic is, it has different\ndifferent slopes with respect to some value. Okay, so the loss with respect to some weight\nw zero, versus w one versus w n, they might all be different. Right? So some way that I kind of\nthink about it is, to what extent is this value contributing to our loss. And we can actually\nfigure that out through some calculus, which we're not going to touch up on in this specific course.\nBut if you want to learn more about neural nets, you should probably also learn some calculus\nand figure out what exactly back propagation is doing, in order to actually calculate, you know,\nhow much do we have to backstep by. So the thing is here, you might notice that this follows\nthis curve at all of these different points. And the closer we get to the bottom, the smaller\nthis step becomes. Now stick with me here. So my new value, this is what we call a weight update,\nI'm going to take w zero, and I'm going to set some new value for w zero. And what I'm going to\nset for that is the old value of w zero, plus some factor, which I'll just call alpha for now,\ntimes whatever this arrow is. So that's basically saying, okay, take our old w zero, our old weight,\nand just decrease it this way. So I guess increase it in this direction, right, like take a step in\nthis direction. But this alpha here is telling us, okay, don't don't take a huge step, right,\njust in case we're wrong, take a small step, take a small step in that direction, see if we get any\ncloser. And for those of you who, you know, do want to look more into the mathematics of things,\nthe reason why I use a plus here is because this here is the negative gradient, right, if this were\njust the if you were to use the actual gradient, this should be a minus.\nNow this alpha is something that we call the learning rate. Okay, and that adjusts how quickly\nwe're taking steps. And that might, you know, tell our that that will ultimately control\nhow long it takes for our neural net to converge. Or sometimes if you set it too high, it might even\ndiverge. But with all of these weights, so here I have w zero, w one, and then w n. We make the same\nupdate to all of them after we calculate the loss, the gradient of the loss with respect to that\nweight. So that's how back propagation works. And that is everything that's going on here. After we\ncalculate the loss, we're calculating gradients, making adjustments in the model. So we're setting\nall the all the weights to something adjusted slightly. And then we're going to calculate the\ngradient. And then we're saying, Okay, let's take the training set and run it through the model\nagain, and go through this loop all over again. So for machine learning, we already have seen some\nlibraries that we use, right, we've already seen SK learn. But when we start going into neural\nnetworks, this is kind of what we're trying to program. And it's not very fun to try to\ndo this from scratch, because not only will we probably have a lot of bugs, but also probably\nnot going to be fast enough, right? Wouldn't it be great if there are just some, you know,\nfull time professionals that are dedicated to solving this problem, and they could literally\njust give us their code that's already running really fast? Well, the answer is, yes, that exists.\nAnd that's why we use TensorFlow. So TensorFlow makes it really easy to define these models. But\nwe also have enough control over what exactly we're feeding into this model. So for example,\nthis line here is basically saying, Okay, let's create a sequential neural net. So sequential is\njust, you know, what we've seen here, it just goes one layer to the next. And a dense layer means that\na dense layer means that all of them are interconnected. So here, this is interconnected with all of these\nnodes, and this one's all these, and then this one gets connected to all of the next ones, and so on.\nSo we're going to create 16 dense nodes with relu activation functions. And then we're going\nto create another layer of 16 dense nodes with relu activation. And then our output layer is going\nto be just one node. Okay. And that's how easy it is to define something in TensorFlow. So TensorFlow\nis an open source library that helps you develop and train your ML models. Let's implement this\nfor a neural net. So we're using a neural net for classification. Now, so our neural net model,\nwe are going to use TensorFlow, and I don't think I imported that up here. So we are going to import\nthat down here. So I'm going to import TensorFlow as TF. And enter. Cool. So my neural net model\nis going to be, I'm going to use this. So essentially, this is saying layer all these\nthings that I'm about to pass in. So yeah, layer them linear stack of layers, layer them as a model.\nAnd what that means, nope, not that. So what that means is I can pass in\nsome sort of layer, and I'm just going to use a dense layer.\nOops, dot dense. And let's say we have 32 units. Okay, I will also\nset the activation as really. And at first we have to specify the input shape. So here we have 10,\nand comma. Alright. Alright, so that's our first layer. Now our next layer, I'm just going to have\nanother dense layer of 32 units all using relu. And that's it. So for the final layer, this is\njust going to be my output layer, it's going to just be one node. And the activation is going to\nbe sigmoid. So if you recall from our logistic regression, what happened there was when we had\na sigmoid, it looks something like this, right? So by creating a sigmoid activation on our last layer,\nwe're essentially projecting our predictions to be zero or one, just like in logistic regression.\nAnd that's going to help us, you know, we can just round to zero or one and classify that way.\nOkay. So this is my neural net model. And I'm going to compile this. So in TensorFlow,\nwe have to compile it. It's really cool, because I can just literally pass in what type of optimizer\nI want, and it'll do it. So here, if I go to optimizers, I'm actually going to use atom.\nAnd you'll see that, you know, the learning rate is 0.001. So I'm just going to use that default.\nSo 0.001. And my loss is going to be binary cross entropy. And the metrics that I'm also going to\ninclude on here, so it already will consider loss, but I'm, I'm also going to tack on accuracy.\nSo we can actually see that in a plot later on. Alright, so I'm going to run this.\nAnd one thing that I'm going to also do is I'm going to define these plot definitions. So I'm\nactually copying and pasting this, I got these from TensorFlow. So if you go on to some TensorFlow\ntutorial, they actually have these, this like, defined. And that's exactly what I'm doing here.\nSo I'm actually going to move this cell up, run that. So we're basically plotting the loss\nover all the different epochs. epochs means like training cycles. And we're going to run that. So\nmeans like training cycles. And we're going to plot the accuracy over all the epochs.\nAlright, so we have our model. And now all that's left is, let's train it. Okay.\nSo I'm going to say history. So TensorFlow is great, because it keeps track of the history\nof the training, which is why we can go and plot it later on. Now I'm going to set that equal to\nthis neural net model. And fit that with x train, y train, I'm going to make the number of epochs\nequal to let's say just let's just use 100 for now. And the batch size, I'm going to set equal to,\nlet's say 32. Alright. And the validation split. So what the validation split does, if it's down\nhere somewhere. Okay, so yeah, this validation split is just the fraction of the training data\nto be used as validation data. So essentially, every single epoch, what's going on is TensorFlow\nsaying, leave certain if this is point two, then leave 20% out. And we're going to test how the\nmodel performs on that 20% that we've left out. Okay, so it's basically like our validation data\nset. But TensorFlow does it on our training data set during the training. So we have now a measure\noutside of just our validation data set to see, you know, what's going on. So validation split,\nI'm going to make that 0.2. And we can run this. So if I run that, all right, and I'm actually going\nto set verbose equal to zero, which means, okay, don't print anything, because printing something\nfor 100 epochs might get kind of annoying. So I'm just going to let it run, let it train,\nand then we'll see what happens. Cool, so it finished training. And now what I can do is\nbecause you know, I've already defined these two functions, I can go ahead and I can plot the loss,\noops, loss of that history. And I can also plot the accuracy throughout the training.\nSo this is a little bit ish what we're looking for. We definitely are looking for a steadily\ndecreasing loss and an increasing accuracy. So here we do see that, you know, our validation\naccuracy improves from around point seven, seven or something all the way up to somewhere around\npoint, maybe eight one. And our loss is decreasing. So this is good. It is expected that the validation\nloss and accuracy is performing worse than the training loss or accuracy. And that's because\nour model is training on that data. So it's adapting to that data. Whereas the validation stuff is,\nyou know, stuff that it hasn't seen yet. So, so that's why. So in machine learning, as we saw above,\nwe could change a bunch of the parameters, right? Like I could change this to 64. So now it'd be\na row of 64 nodes, and then 32, and then one. So I can change some of these parameters.\nAnd a lot of machine learning is trying to find, hey, what do we set these hyper parameters to?\nSo what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to rewrite this so that we can do something what's\nknown as a grid search. So we can search through an entire space of hey, what happens if, you know,\nwe have 64 nodes and 64 nodes, or 16 nodes and 16 nodes, and so on. And then on top of all that,\nwe can, you know, we can change this learning rate, we can change how many epochs we can change,\nyou know, the batch size, all these things might affect our training. And just for kicks,\nI'm also going to add what's known as a dropout layer in here. And what dropout is doing is\nsaying, hey, randomly choose with at this rate, certain nodes, and don't train them in, you know,\nin a certain iteration. So this helps prevent overfitting. Okay, so I'm actually going to\ndefine this as a function called train model, we're going to pass in x train, y train,\nthe number of nodes, the dropout, you know, the probability that we just talked about\nlearning rate. So I'm actually going to say lr batch size. And we can also pass in number epochs,\nright? I mentioned that as a parameter. So indent this, so it goes under here. And with these two,\nI'm going to set this equal to number of nodes. And now with the two dropout layers, I'm going\nto set dropout prob. So now you know, the probability of turning off a node during the training\nis equal to dropout prob. And I'm going to keep the output layer the same. Now I'm compiling it,\nbut this here is now going to be my learning rate. And I still want binary cross entropy and\naccuracy. We are actually going to train our model inside of this function. But here we can do the\nepochs equal epochs, and this is equal to whatever, you know, we're passing in x train,\ny train belong right here. Okay, so those are getting passed in as well. And finally, at the\nend, I'm going to return this model and the history of that model. Okay. So now what I'll do\nis let's just go through all of these. So let's say let's keep epochs at 100. And now what I can\ndo is I can say, hey, for a number of nodes in, let's say, let's do 1632 and 64, to see what\nhappens for the different dropout probabilities. And I mean, zero would be nothing. Let's use 0.2.\nAlso, to see what happens. You know, for the learning rate in 0.005, 0.001. And you know,\nmaybe we want to throw on 0.1 in there as well. And then for the batch size, let's do 1632,\n64 as well. Actually, and let's also throw in 128. Actually, let's get rid of 16. Sorry,\nso 128 in there. That should be 01. I'm going to record the model and history using this\ntrain model here. So we're going to do x train y train, the number of nodes is going to be,\nyou know, the number of nodes that we've defined here, dropout, prob, LR, batch size, and epochs.\nOkay. And then now we have both the model and the history. And what I'm going to do is again,\nI want to plot the loss for the history. I'm also going to plot the accuracy.\nProbably should have done them side by side, that probably would have been easier.\nOkay, so what I'm going to do is split up, split this up. And that will be\nthe subplots. So now this is just saying, okay, I want one row and two columns in that row for my\nplots. Okay, so I'm going to plot on my axis one, the loss. I don't actually know this is going to\nwork. Okay, we don't care about the grid. Yeah, let's let's keep the grid. And then now my other.\nSo now on here, I'm going to plot all the accuracies on the second plot.\nI might have to debug this a bit.\nWe should be able to get rid of that. If we run this, we already have history saved as a variable\nin here. So if I just run it on this, okay, it has no attribute x label. Oh, I think it's because\nit's like set x label or something. Okay, yeah, so it's, it's set instead of just x label, y label.\nSo let's see if that works. All right, cool. Um, and let's actually make this a bit larger.\nOkay, so we can actually change the figure size that I'm gonna set. Let's see what happens if I\nset that to. Oh, that's not the way I wanted it. Okay, so that looks reasonable.\nAnd that's just going to be my plot history function. So now I can plot them side by side.\nHere, I'm going to plot the history. And what I'm actually going to do is I so here, first,\nI'm going to print out all these parameters. So I'm going to print out\nthe F string to print out all of this stuff. So here, I'm going to print out all these parameters.\nUh, all of this stuff. So here, I'm printing out how many nodes, um, the dropout probability,\nuh, the learning rate.\nAnd we already know how many you found, so I'm not even going to bother with that.\nSo once we plot this, uh, let's actually also figure out what the, um, what the validation\nlosses on our validation set that we have that we created all the way back up here.\nAlright, so remember, we created three data sets. Let's call our model and evaluate what the\nvalidation data with the validation data sets loss would be. And I actually want to record,\nlet's say I want to record whatever model has the least validation loss. So\nfirst, I'm going to initialize that to infinity so that you know, any model will beat that score.\nSo if I do float infinity, that will set that to infinity. And maybe I'll keep\ntrack of the parameters. Actually, it doesn't really matter. I'm just going to keep track of\nthe model. And I'm gonna set that to none. So now down here, if the validation loss is ever\nless than the least validation loss, then I am going to simply come down here and say,\nHey, this validation for this least validation loss is now equal to the validation loss.\nAnd the least loss model is whatever this model is that just earned that validation loss. Okay.\nSo we are actually just going to let this run for a while. And then we're going to get our least\nlast model after that. So let's just run. All right, and now we wait.\nAll right, so we've finally finished training. And you'll notice that okay, down here, the loss\nactually gets to like 0.29. The accuracy is around 88%, which is pretty good. So you might be wondering,\nokay, why is this accuracy in this? Like, these are both the validation. So this accuracy here\nis on the validation data set that we've defined at the beginning, right? And this one here,\nthis is actually taking 20% of our tests, our training set every time during the training,\nand saying, Okay, how much of it do I get right now? You know, after this one step where I didn't\ntrain with any of that. So they're slightly different. And actually, I realized later on\nthat I probably you know, probably what I should have done is over here, when we were defining\nthe model fit, instead of the validation split, you can define the validation data.\nAnd you can pass in the validation data, I don't know if this is the proper syntax. But\nthat's probably what I should have done. But instead, you know, we'll just stick with what\nwe have here. So you'll see at the end, you know, with the 64 nodes, it seems like this is our best\nperformance 64 nodes with a dropout of 0.2, a learning rate of 0.001, and a batch size of 64.\nAnd it does seem like yes, the validation, you know, the fake validation, but the validation\nloss is decreasing, and then the accuracy is increasing, which is a good sign. Okay,\nso finally, what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to predict. So I'm going to take\nthis model, which we've called our least loss model, I'm going to take this model,\nand I'm going to predict x test on that. And you'll see that it gives me some values that\nare really close to zero and some that are really close to one. And that's because we have a sigmoid\noutput. So if I do this, and what I can do is I can cast them. So I'm going to say anything that's\ngreater than 0.5, set that to one. So if I actually, I think what happens if I do this?\nOh, okay, so I have to cast that as type. And so now you'll see that it's ones and zeros. And I'm\nactually going to transform this into a column as well. So here I'm going to Oh, oops, I didn't\nI didn't mean to do that. Okay, no, I wanted to just reshape it to that. So now it's one dimensional.\nOkay. And using that we can actually just rerun the classification report based on these this\nneural net output. And you'll see that okay, the the F ones are the accuracy gives us 87%. So it\nseems like what happened here is the precision on class zero. So the hadrons has increased a bit,\nbut the recall decreased. But the F one score is still at a good point eight one. And for the other\nclass, it looked like the precision decreased a bit the recall increased for an overall F one score.\nThat's also been increased. I think I interpreted that properly. I mean, we went through all this\nwork and we got a model that performs actually very, very similarly to the SVM model that we\nhad earlier. And the whole point of this exercise was to demonstrate, okay, these are how you can\ndefine your models. But it's also to say, hey, maybe, you know, neural nets are very, very\npowerful, as you can tell. But sometimes, you know, an SVM or some other model might actually be more\nappropriate. But in this case, I guess it didn't really matter which one we use at the end. An 87%\naccuracy score is still pretty good. So yeah, let's now move on to regression.\nWe just saw a bunch of different classification models. Now let's shift gears into regression,\nthe other type of supervised learning. If we look at this plot over here, we see a bunch of scattered\ndata points. And here we have our x value for those data points. And then we have the corresponding y\nvalue, which is now our label. And when we look at this plot, well, our goal in regression is to find\nthe line of best fit that best models this data. Essentially, we're trying to let's say we're given\nsome new value of x that we don't have in our sample, we're trying to say, okay, what would my\nprediction for y be for that given x value. So that, you know, might be somewhere around there.\nI don't know. But remember, in regression that, you know, given certain features,\nwe're trying to predict some continuous numerical value for y.\nIn linear regression, we want to take our data and fit a linear model to this data. So in this case,\nour linear model might look something along the lines of here. Right. So this here would be\nconsidered as maybe our line of best fit. And this line is modeled by the equation, I'm going to write\nit down here, y equals b zero, plus b one x. Now b zero just means it's this y intercept. So if we\nextend this y down here, this value here is b zero, and then b one defines the source of the\nline, defines the slope of this line. Okay. All right. So that's the that's the formula\nfor linear regression. And how exactly do we come up with that formula? What are we trying to do\nwith this linear regression? You know, we could just eyeball where the line be, but humans are\nnot very good at eyeballing certain things like that. I mean, we can get close, but a computer is\nbetter at giving us a precise value for b zero and b one. Well, let's introduce the concept of\nsomething known as a residual. Okay, so residual, you might also hear this being called the error.\nAnd what that means is, let's take some data point in our data set. And we're going to evaluate how\nfar off is our prediction from a data point that we already have. So this here is our y, let's say,\nthis is 12345678. So this is y eight, let's call it, you'll see that I use this y i in order to\nI in order to represent, hey, just one of these points. Okay. So this here is why and this here\nwould be the prediction. Oops, this here would be the prediction for y eight, which I've labeled\nwith this hat. Okay, if it has a hat on it, that means hey, this is what this is my guess this is\nmy prediction for you know, this specific value of x. Okay. Now the residual would be this distance\nhere between y eight and y hat eight. So y eight minus y hat eight. All right, because that would\ngive us this here. And I'm just going to take the absolute value of this. Because what if it's below\nthe line, right, then you would get a negative value, but distance can't be negative. So we're\njust going to put a little hat, or we're going to put a little absolute value around this quantity.\nAnd that gives us the residual or the error. So let me rewrite that. And you know, to generalize\nto all the points, I'm going to say the residual can be calculated as y i minus y hat of i. Okay.\nSo this just means the distance between some given point, and its prediction, its corresponding\nprediction on the line. So now, with this residual, this line of best fit is generally trying to\ndecrease these residuals as much as possible. So now that we have some value for the error,\nour line of best fit is trying to decrease the error as much as possible for all of the different\ndata points. And that might mean, you know, minimizing the sum of all the residuals. So this\nhere, this is the sum symbol. And if I just stick the residual calculation in there,\nit looks something like that, right. And I'm just going to say, okay, for all of the eyes in our\ndata set, so for all the different points, we're going to sum up all the residuals. And I'm going\nto try to decrease that with my line of best fit. So I'm going to find the B0 and B1, which gives\nme the lowest value of this. Okay. Now in other, you know, sometimes in different circumstances,\nwe might attach a squared to that. So we're trying to decrease the sum of the squared residuals.\nAnd what that does is it just, you know, it adds a higher penalty for how far off we are from,\nyou know, points that are further off. So that is linear regression, we're trying to find\nthis equation, some line of best fit that will help us decrease this measure of error\nwith respect to all the data points that we have in our data set, and try to come up with\nthe best prediction for all of them. This is known as simple linear regression.\nAnd basically, that means, you know, our equation looks something like this. Now, there's also\nmultiple linear regression, which just means that hey, if we have more than one value for x, so like\nthink of our feature vectors, we have multiple values in our x vector, then our predictor might\nlook something more like this. Actually, I'm just going to say etc, plus b n, x n. So now I'm coming\nup with some coefficient for all of the different x values that I have in my vector. Now you guys\nmight have noticed that I have some assumptions over here. And you might be asking, okay, Kylie,\nwhat in the world do these assumptions mean? So let's go over them.\nSo let's go over them. The first one is linearity.\nAnd what that means is, let's say I have a data set. Okay.\nLinearity just means, okay, my does my data follow a linear pattern? Does y increase as x\nincreases? Or does y decrease at as x increases? Does so if y increases or decreases at a constant\nrate as x increases, then you're probably looking at something linear. So what's the example of a\nnonlinear data set? Let's say I had data that might look something like that. Okay. So now just\nvisually judging this, you might say, okay, seems like the line of best fit might actually be some\ncurve like this. Right. And in this case, we don't satisfy that linearity assumption anymore.\nSo with linearity, we basically just want our data set to follow some sort of linear trajectory.\nAnd independence, our second assumption\njust means this point over here, it should have no influence on this point over here,\nor this point over here, or this point over here. So in other words, all the points,\nall the samples in our data set should be independent. Okay, they should not rely on\none another, they should not affect one another.\nOkay, now, normality and homoscedasticity, those are concepts which use this residual. Okay. So if\nI have a plot that looks something like this, and I have a plot that looks like this. Okay,\nsomething like this. And my line of best fit is somewhere here, maybe it's something like that.\nIn order to look at these normality and homoscedasticity assumptions, let's look at\nthe residual plot. Okay. And what that means is I'm going to keep my same x axis. But instead\nof plotting now where they are relative to this y, I'm going to plot these errors. So now I'm\ngoing to plot y minus y hat like this. Okay. And now you know, this one is slightly positive,\nso it might be here, this one down here is negative, it might be here. So our residual plot,\nit's literally just a plot of how you know, the values are distributed around our line of best\nfit. So it looks like it might, you know, look something like this. Okay. So this might be our\nresidual plot. And what normality means, so our assumptions are normality and homoscedasticity,\nI might have butchered that spelling, I don't really know. But what normality is saying is\nsaying, okay, these residuals should be normally distributed. Okay, around this line of best fit,\nit should follow a normal distribution. And now what homoscedasticity says, okay, our variants\nof these points should remain constant throughout. So this spread here should be approximately the\nsame as this spread over here. Now, what's an example of where you know, homoscedasticity is\nnot held? Well, let's say that our original plot actually looks something like this.\nOkay, so now if we looked at the residuals for that, it might look something\nlike that. And now if we look at this spread of the points, it decreases, right? So now the spread\nis not constant, which means that homoscedasticity, this assumption would not be fulfilled, and it\nmight not be appropriate to use linear regression. So that's just linear regression. Basically,\nwe have a bunch of data points, we want to predict some y value for those. And we're trying to come\nup with this line of best fit that best describes, hey, given some value x, what would be my best\nguess of what y is. So let's move on to how do we evaluate a linear regression model. So the first\nmeasure that I'm going to talk about is known as mean absolute error, or MAE\nfor short, okay. And mean absolute error is basically saying, all right, let's take\nall the errors. So all these residuals that we talked about, let's sum up the distance\nfor all of them, and then take the average. And then that can describe, you know, how far off are\nwe. So the mathematical formula for that would be, okay, let's take all the residuals.\nAlright, so this is the distance. Actually, let me redraw a plot down here. So\nsuppose I have a data set, look like this. And here are all my data points, right. And now let's\nsay my line looks something like that. So my mean absolute error would be summing up all of these\nvalues. This was a mistake. So summing up all of these, and then dividing by how many data points\nI have. So what would be all the residuals, it would be y i, right, so every single point,\nminus y hat i, so the prediction for that on here. And then we're going to sum over all of\nall of the different i's in our data set. Right, so i, and then we divide by the number of points\nwe have. So actually, I'm going to rewrite this to make it a little clearer. So i is equal to\nwhatever the first data point is all the way through the nth data point. And then we divide\nit by n, which is how many points there are. Okay, so this is our measure of mae. And this is basically\ntelling us, okay, in on average, this is the distance between our predicted value and the\nactual value in our training set. Okay. And mae is good because it allows us to, you know, when we\nget this value here, we can literally directly compare it to whatever units the y value is in.\nSo let's say y is we're talking, you know, the prediction of the price of a house, right, in\ndollars. Once we have once we calculate the mae, we can literally say, oh, the average, you know,\nprice, the average, how much we're off by is literally this many dollars. Okay. So that's the\nmean absolute error. An evaluation technique that's also closely related to that is called the mean\nsquared error. And this is MSE for short. Okay. Now, if I take this plot again, and I duplicated\nand move it down here, well, the gist of mean squared error is kind of the same, but instead\nof the absolute value, we're going to square. So now the MSE is something along the lines of,\nokay, let's sum up something, right, so we're going to sum up all of our errors.\nSo now I'm going to do y i minus y hat i. But instead of absolute valuing them,\nI'm going to square them all. And then I'm going to divide by n in order to find the mean. So\nbasically, now I'm taking all of these different values, and I'm squaring them first before I add\nthem to one another. And then I divide by n. And the reason why we like using mean squared error\nis that it helps us punish large errors in the prediction. And later on, MSE might be important\nbecause of differentiability, right? So a quadratic equation is differentiable, you know,\nif you're familiar with calculus, a quadratic equation is differentiable, whereas the absolute\nvalue function is not totally differentiable everywhere. But if you don't understand that,\ndon't worry about it, you won't really need it right now. And now one downside of mean squared\nerror is that once I calculate the mean squared error over here, and I go back over to y, and I\nwant to compare the values. Well, it gets a little bit trickier to do that because now my mean squared\nerror is in terms of y squared, right? It's this is now squared. So instead of just dollars, how,\nyou know, how many dollars off am I I'm talking how many dollars squared off am I. And that,\nyou know, to humans, it doesn't really make that much sense. Which is why we have created\nsomething known as the root mean squared error. And I'm just going to copy this diagram over here\nbecause it's very, very similar to mean squared error. Except now we take a big squared root.\nOkay, so this is our messy, and we take the square root of that mean squared error. And so now the\nterm in which you know, we're defining our error is now in terms of that dollar sign symbol again.\nSo that's a pro of root mean squared error is that now we can say, okay, our error according\nto this metric is this many dollar signs off from our predictor. Okay, so it's in the same unit,\nwhich is one of the pros of root mean squared error. And now finally, there is the coefficient\nof determination, or r squared. And this is a formula for r squared. So r squared is equal\nto one minus RSS over TSS. Okay, so what does that mean? Basically, RSS stands for the sum\nof the squared residuals. So maybe it should be SSR instead, but\nRSS sum of the squared residuals, and this is equal to if I take the sum of all the values,\nand I take y i minus y hat, i, and square that, that is my RSS, right, it's a sum of the squared\nresiduals. Now TSS, let me actually use a different color for that.\nSo TSS is the total sum of squares.\nAnd what that means is that instead of being with respect to this prediction,\nwe are instead going to\ntake each y value and just subtract the mean of all the y values, and square that.\nOkay, so if I drew this out,\nand if this were my\nactually, let's use a different color. Let's use green. If this were my predictor,\nso RSS is giving me this measure here, right? It's giving me some estimate of how far off we are from\nour regressor that we predicted. Actually, I'm gonna take this one, and I'm gonna take this one,\nand actually, I'm going to use red for that. Well, TSS, on the other hand, is saying, okay,\nhow far off are these values from the mean. So if we literally didn't do any calculations for the\nline of best fit, if we just took all the y values and average all of them, and said, hey,\nthis is the average value for every single x value, I'm just going to predict that average value\ninstead, then it's asking, okay, how far off are all these points from that line?\nOkay, and remember that this square means that we're punishing larger errors, right? So even if\nthey look somewhat close in terms of distance, the further a few data points are, then the further\nthe larger our total sum of squares is going to be. Sorry, that was my dog. So the total sum of\nsquares is taking all of these values and saying, okay, what is the sum of squares, if I didn't do\nany regressor, and I literally just calculated the average of all the y values in my data set,\nand for every single x value, I'm just going to predict that average, which means that okay,\nlike, that means that maybe y and x aren't associated with each other at all. Like the\nbest thing that I can do for any new x value, just predict, hey, this is the average of my data set.\nAnd this total sum of squares is saying, okay, well, with respect to that average,\nwhat is our error? Right? So up here, the sum of the squared residuals, this is telling us what is\nour what what is our error with respect to this line of best fit? Well, our total sum of squares\nsaying what is the error with respect to, you know, just the average y value. And if our line\nof best fit is a better fit, then this total sum of squares, that means that you know, this numerator,\nthat means that this numerator is going to be smaller than this denominator, right?\nAnd if our errors in our line of best fit are much smaller, then that means that this ratio\nof the RSS over TSS is going to be very small, which means that R squared is going to go towards\none. And now when R squared is towards one, that means that that's usually a sign that we have a\ngood predictor. It's one of the signs, not the only one. So over here, I also have, you know,\nthat there's this adjusted R squared. And what that does, it just adjusts for the number of terms.\nSo x1, x2, x3, etc. It adjusts for how many extra terms we add, because usually when we,\nyou know, add an extra term, the R squared value will increase because that'll help us predict\ny some more. But the value for the adjusted R squared increase if the new term actually\nimproves this model fit more than expected, you know, by chance. So that's what adjusted\nR squared is. I'm not, you know, it's out of the scope of this one specific course.\nAnd now that's linear regression. Basically, I've covered the concept of residuals or errors.\nAnd, you know, how do we use that in order to find the line of best fit? And you know,\nour computer can do all the calculations for us, which is nice. But behind the scenes,\nit's trying to minimize that error, right? And then we've gone through all the different\nways of actually evaluating a linear regression model and the pros and cons of each one.\nSo now let's look at an example. So we're still on supervised learning. But now we're just going to\ntalk about regression. So what happens when you don't just want to predict, you know, type 123?\nWhat happens if you actually want to predict a certain value? So again, I'm on the UCI machine\nlearning repository. And here I found this data set about bike sharing in Seoul, South Korea.\nSo this data set is predicting rental bike count. And here it's the kind of bikes rented at each\nhour. So what we're going to do, again, you're going to go into the data folder, and you're going\nto download this CSV file. And we're going to move over to collab again. And here I'm going to name\nthis FCC bikes and regression. I don't remember what I called the last one. But yeah, FCC bikes\nregression. Now I'm going to import a bunch of the same things that I did earlier. And, you know,\nI'm going to also continue to import the oversampler and the standard scaler. And then I'm actually\nalso just going to let you guys know that I have a few more things I wanted import. So this is a\nlibrary that lets us copy things. Seaborn is a wrapper over a matplotlib. So it also allows us\nto plot certain things. And then just letting you know that we're also going to be using\nTensorFlow. Okay, so one more thing that we're also going to be using, we're going to use the\nsklearn linear model library. Actually, let me make my screen a little bit bigger. So yeah,\nawesome. Run this and that'll import all the things that we need. So again, I'm just going to,\nyou know, give some credit to where we got this data set. So let me copy and paste this UCI thing.\nAnd I will also give credit to this here.\nOkay, cool. All right, cool. So this is our data set. And again, it tells us all the different\nattributes that we have right here. So I'm actually going to go ahead and paste this in here.\nFeel free to copy and paste this if you want me to read it out loud, so you can type it.\nIt's byte count, hour, temp, humidity, wind, visibility, dew point, temp, radiation, rain,\nsnow, and functional, whatever that means. Okay, so I'm going to come over here and import my data\nby dragging and dropping. All right. Now, one thing that you guys might actually need to do is\nyou might actually have to open up the CSV because there were, at first, a few like forbidding\ncharacters in mine, at least. So you might have to get rid of like, I think there was a degree here,\nbut my computer wasn't recognizing it. So I got rid of that. So you might have to go through\nand get rid of some of those labels that are incorrect. I'm going to do this. Okay. But\nafter we've done that, we've imported in here, I'm going to create a data a data frame from that. So,\nall right, so now what I can do is I can read that CSV file and I can get the data into here.\nSo so like data dot CSV. Okay, so now if I call data dot head, you'll see that I have all the\nvarious labels, right? And then I have the data in there. So I'm going to from here, I'm actually\ngoing to get rid of some of these columns that, you know, I don't really care about. So here,\nI'm going to, when I when I type this in, I'm going to drop maybe the date, whether or not it's a\nholiday, and the various seasons. So I'm just not going to care about these things. Access equals\none means drop it from the columns. So now you'll see that okay, we still have, I mean,\nI guess you don't really notice it. But if I set the data frames columns equal to data set calls,\nand I look at, you know, the first five things, then you'll see that this is now our data set.\nIt's a lot easier to read. So another thing is, I'm actually going to\ndf functional. And we're going to create this. So remember that our computers are not very good\nat language, we want it to be in zeros and ones. So here, I will convert that.\nWell, if this is equal to yes, then that that gets mapped as one. So then set type integer. All right.\nGreat. Cool. So the thing is, right now, these by counts are for whatever hour. So\nto make this example simpler, I'm just going to index on an hour, and I'm gonna say, okay,\nwe're only going to use that specific hour. So I'm just going to index on an hour, and I'm\ngoing to use an hour. So here, let's say. So this data frame is only going to be data frame where\nthe hour, let's say it equals 12. Okay, so it's noon. All right. So now you'll see that all the\nequal to 12. And I'm actually going to now drop that column. Our access equals one. Alright,\nso we run this cell. Okay, so now we got rid of the hour in here. And we just have the by count,\nthe temperature, humidity, wind, visibility, and yada, yada, yada. Alright, so what I want to do\nis I'm going to actually plot all of these. So for i in all the columns, so the range, length of\nwhatever its data frame is, and all the columns, because I don't have by count as\nactually, it's my first thing. So what I'm going to do is say for a label in data frame,\ncolumns, everything after the first thing, so that would give me the temperature and\nonwards. So these are all my features, right? I'm going to just scatter. So I want to see how that\nlabel how that specific data, how that affects the by count. So I'm going to plot the bike count on\nthe y axis. And I'm going to plot, you know, whatever the specific label is on the x axis.\nAnd I'm going to title this, whatever the label is. And, you know, make my y label, the bike count\nat noon. And the x label as just the label. Okay, now, I guess we don't even need the legend.\nWe don't even need the legend. So just show that plot. All right. So it seems like functional is\nnot really doesn't really give us any utility. So then snow rain seems like this radiation,\nyou know, is fairly linear dew point temperature, visibility, wind doesn't really seem like it does\nmuch humidity, kind of maybe like an inverse relationship. But the temperature definitely\nlooks like there's a relationship between that and the number of bikes, right. So what I'm actually\ngoing to do is I'm going to drop some of the ones that don't don't seem like they really matter. So\nmaybe wind, you know, visibility. Yeah, so I'm going to get rid of when visibility and functional.\nSo now data frame, and I'm going to drop wind, visibility, and functional. All right. And the\naxis again is the column. So that's one. So if I look at my data set, now, I have just the\ntemperature, the humidity, the dew point temperature, radiation, rain, and snow. So again,\nwhat I want to do is I want to split this into my training, my validation and my test data set,\njust as we talked before. Here, we can use the exact same thing that we just did. And we can say\nnumpy dot split, and sample, you know that the whole sample, and then create our splits\nof the data frame. And we're going to do that. But now set this to eight. Okay.\nSo I don't really care about, you know, the the full grid, the full array. So I'm just going to\nuse an underscore for that variable. But I will get my training x and y's. And actually, I don't\nhave a function for getting the x and y's. So here, I'm going to write a function defined,\nget x y. And I'm going to pass in the data frame. And I'm actually going to pass in what the name\nof the y label is, and what the x what specific x labels I want to look at. So here, if that's none,\nthen I'm just like, like, I'm only going to I'm going to get everything from the data set. That's\nnot the wildlife. So here, I'm actually going to make first a deep copy of my data frame.\nAnd that basically means I'm just copying everything over. If, if like x labels is none,\nso if not x labels, then all I'm going to do is say, all right, x is going to be whatever this\ndata frame is. And I'm just going to take all the columns. So C for C, and data frame, dot columns,\nif C does not equal the y label, right, and I'm going to get the values from that. But if there\nis the x labels, well, okay, so in order to index only one thing, so like, let's say I pass in only\none thing in here, then my data frame is, so let me make a case for that. So if the length of x\nlabels is equal to one, then what I'm going to do is just say that this is going to be x labels,\nand add that just that label values, and I actually need to reshape to make this 2d.\nSo I'm going to pass in negative one comma one there. Now, otherwise, if I have like a list of\nspecific x labels that I want to use, then I'm actually just going to say x is equal to data\nframe of those x labels, dot values. And that should suffice. Alright, so now that's just me\nextracting x. And in order to get my y, I'm going to do y equals data frame, and then passing the y\nlabel. And at the very end, I'm going to say data equals NP dot h stack. So I'm stacking them horizontally\none next to each other. And I'll take x and y, and return that. Oh, but this needs to be values.\nAnd I'm actually going to reshape this to make it 2d as well so that we can do this h stack.\nAnd I will return data x, y. So now I should be able to say, okay, get x, y, and take that data\nframe. And the y label, so my y label is byte count. And actually, so for the x label, I'm actually\ngoing to let's just do like one dimension right now. And earlier, I got rid of the plots, but we\nhad seen that maybe, you know, the temperature dimension does really well. And we might be able\nto use that to predict why. So I'm going to label this also that, you know, it's just using the\ntemperature. And I am also going to do this again for, oh, this should be train. And this should be\nvalidation. And this should be a test. Because oh, that's Val. Right. But here, it should be Val.\nAnd this should be test. Alright, so we run this and now we have our training validation and test\ndata sets for just the temperature. So if I look at x train temp, it's literally just the temperature.\nOkay, and I'm doing this first to show you simple linear regression. Alright, so right now I can\ncreate a regressor. So I can say the temp regressor here. And then I'm going to, you know, make a\nlinear regression model. And just like before, I can simply fix fit my x train temp, y train temp\nin order to train train this linear regression model. Alright, and then I can also, I can print\nthis regressor is coefficients and the intercept. So if I do that, okay, this is the coefficient\nfor whatever the temperature is, and then the the x intercept, okay, or the y intercept, sorry. All\nright. And I can, you know, score, so I can get the the r squared score. So I can score x test\nand y test. All right, so it's an r squared of around point three eight, which is better than\nzero, which would mean, hey, there's absolutely no association. But it's also not, you know, like,\ngood, it depends on the context. But, you know, the higher that number, it means the higher that\nthe two variables would be correlated, right? Which here, it's all right. It just means there's\nmaybe some association between the two. But the reason why I want to do this one D was to show\nyou, you know, if we plotted this, this is what it would look like. So if I create a scatterplot,\nand let's take the training. So this is our data. And then let's make it blue. And then if I\nalso plotted, so something that I can do is say, you know, the x range, I'm going to plot it,\nis when space, and this goes from negative 20 to 40, this piece of data. So I'm going to just say,\nlet's take 100 things from there. So I'm going to plot x, and I'm going to take this temper,\nthis, like, regressor, and predict x with that. Okay, and this label, I'm going to label that\nthe fit. And this color, let's make this red. And let's actually set the line with, so I can,\nI can change how thick that value is. Okay. Now at the very end, let's create a legend. And let's,\nall right, let's also create, you know, title, all these things that matter, in some sense. So\nhere, let's just say, this would be the bikes, versus the temperature, right? And the y label\nwould be number of bikes. And the x label would be the temperature. So I actually think that this\nmight cause an error. Yeah. So it's expecting a 2d array. So we actually have to reshape this.\nOkay, there we go. So I just had to make this an array and then reshape it. So it was 2d. Now,\nwe see that, all right, this increases. But again, remember those assumptions that we had about\nlinear regression, like this, I don't really know if this fits those assumptions, right? I just\nwanted to show you guys though, that like, all right, this is what a line of s fit through this\ndata would look like. Okay. Now, we can do multiple linear regression, right. So I'm going to go ahead\nand do that as well. Now, if I take my data set, and instead of the labels, it's actually what's\nmy current data set right now. Alright, so let's just use all of these except for the byte count,\nright. So I'm going to just say for the x labels, let's just take the data frames columns and just\nremove the byte count. So does that work? So if this part should be of x labels is none. And then\nthis should work now. Oops, sorry. Okay, so I have Oh, but this here, because it's not just the\ntemperature anymore, we should actually do this, let's say all, right. So I'm just going to quickly\nrerun this piece here so that we have our temperature only data set. And now we have our\nall data set. Okay. And this regressor, I can do the same thing. So I can do the all regressor.\nAnd I'm going to make this the linear regression. And I'm going to fit this to x train all and y\ntrain all. Okay. Alright, so let's go ahead and also score this regressor. And let's see how the\nR squared performs now. So if I test this on the test data set, what happens? Alright, so our R\nsquare seems to improve it went from point four to point five, two, which is a good sign. Okay.\nAnd I can't necessarily plot, you know, every single dimension. But this just this is just\nto say, okay, this is this is improved, right? Alright, so one cool thing that you can do with\ntensorflow is you can actually do regression, but with the neural net. So here, I'm going\nto we already have our our training data for just the temperature and just, you know, for all the\ndifferent columns. So I'm not going to bother with splitting up the data again, I'm just going to go\nahead and start building the model. So in this linear regression model, typically, you know,\nit does help if we normalize it. So that's very easy to do with tensorflow, I can just create some\nnormalizer layer. So I'm going to do tensorflow Keras layers, and get the normalization layer.\nAnd the input shape for that will just be one because let's just do it again on just the\ntemperature and the access I will make none. Now for this temp normalizer, and I should have had\nan equal sign there. I'm going to adapt this to X train temp, and reshape this to just a single vector.\nSo that should work great. Now with this model, so temp neural net model, what I can do is I can do,\nyou know, dot keras, sequential. And I'm going to pass in this normalizer layer. And then I'm\ngoing to say, hey, just give me one single dense layer with one single unit. And what that's doing\nis saying, all right, well, one single node just means that it's linear. And if you don't add any\nsort of activation function to it, the output is also linear. So here, I'm going to have tensorflow\nKeras layers dot dense. And I'm just going to have one unit. And that's going to be my model. Okay.\nSo with this model, let's compile. And for our optimizer, let's use,\nlet's use the atom again, dot atom, and we have to pass in the learning rate. So learning rate,\nand our learning rate, let's do 0.01. And now, the loss, we actually let's get this one 0.1. And the\nloss, I'm going to do mean squared error. Okay, so we run that we've compiled it, okay, great.\nAnd just like before, we can call history. And I'm going to fit this model. So here,\nif I call fit, I can just fit it, and I'm going to take the x train with the temperature,\nbut reshape it. Y train for the temperature. And I'm going to set verbose equal to zero so\nthat it doesn't, you know, display stuff. I'm actually going to set epochs equal to, let's do\n1000. And the validation data should be let's pass in the validation data set here\nas a tuple. And I know I spelled that wrong. So let's just run this.\nAnd up here, I've copied and pasted the plot loss from our previous but changed the y label\nto MSC. Because now we're talking we're dealing with mean squared error. And I'm going to plot\nthe loss of this history after it's done. So let's just wait for this to finish training and then to\nplot. Okay, so this actually looks pretty good. We see that the value is still the same. So\nthis actually looks pretty good. We see that the values are converging. So now what I can do is\nI'm going to go back up and take this plot. And we are going to just run that plot again. So\nhere, instead of this temperature regressor, I'm going to use the neural net regressor.\nThis neural net model.\nAnd if I run that, I can see that, you know, this also gives me a linear regressor,\nyou'll notice that this this fit is not entirely the same as the one\nup here. And that's due to the training process of, you know, of this neural net. So just two\ndifferent ways to try and try to find the best linear regressor. Okay, but here we're using back\npropagation to train a neural net node, whereas in the other one, they probably are not doing that.\nOkay, they're probably just trying to actually compute the line of s fit. So, okay, given this,\nwell, we can repeat the exact same exercise with our with our multiple linear regressions. Okay,\nbut I'm actually going to skip that part. I will leave that as an exercise to the viewer. Okay,\nso now what would happen if we use a neural net, a real neural net instead of just, you know,\none single node in order to predict this. So let's start on that code, we already have our\nnormalizer. So I'm actually going to take the same setup here. But instead of, you know, this\none dense layer, I'm going to set this equal to 32 units. And for my activation, I'm going to use\nRelu. And now let's duplicate that. And for the final output, I just want one answer. So I just\nwant one cell. And this activation is also going to be Relu, because I can't ever have less than\nzero bytes. So I'm just going to set that as Relu. I'm just going to name this the neural net model.\nOkay. And at the bottom, I'm going to have this neural net model. I'm going to have this neural\nnet model, I'm going to compile. And I will actually use the same compiler here. But instead of\ninstead of a learning rate of 0.01, I'll use 0.001. Okay. And I'm going to train this here.\nSo the history is this neural net model. And I'm going to fit that against x train temp, y train\ntemp, and valid validation data, I'm going to set this again equal to x val temp, and y val temp.\nNow, for the verbose, I'm going to say equal to zero epochs, let's do 100. And here for the batch\nsize, actually, let's just not do a batch size right now. Let's just try it. Let's see what happens\nhere. And again, we can plot the loss of this history after it's done training. So let's just\nrun this. And that's not what we're supposed to get. So what is going on? Here is sequential,\nwe have our temperature normalizer, which I'm wondering now if we have to redo that.\nDo that. Okay, so we do see this decline, it's an interesting curve, but we do we do see it eventually.\nSo this is our loss, which all right, if decreasing, that's a good sign.\nAnd actually, what's interesting is let's just let's plot this model again. So here instead of that.\nAnd you'll see that we actually have this like, curve that looks something like this. So actually,\nwhat if I got rid of this activation? Let's train this again. And see what happens.\nAlright, so even even when I got rid of that really at the end, it kind of knows, hey, you know, if\nit's not the best model, if we had maybe one more layer in here, these are just things that you have\nto play around with. When you're, you know, working with machine learning, it's like, you don't really\nknow what the best model is going to be. For example, this also is not brilliant. But I guess\nit's okay. So my point is, though, that with a neural net, I mean, this is not brilliant, but also\nthere's like no data down here, right? So it's kind of hard for our model to predict. In fact,\nwe probably should have started the prediction somewhere around here. My point, though, is that\nwith this neural net model, you can see that this is no longer a linear predictor, but yet we still\nget an estimate of the value, right? And we can repeat this exact same exercise, right? So let's\ndo that. Right. And we can repeat this exact same exercise with the multiple inputs. So here,\nif I now pass in all of the data, so this is my all normalizer,\nand I should just be able to pass in that. So let's move this to the next cell. Here,\nI'm going to pass in my all normalizer. And let's compile it. Yeah, those parameters look good.\nGreat. So here with the history, when we're trying to fit this model, instead of temp,\nwe're going to use our larger data set with all the features. And let's just train that.\nAnd of course, we want to plot the loss.\nOkay, so that's what our loss looks like. So an interesting curve, but it's decreasing.\nSo before we saw that our R squared score was around point five, two. Well, we don't really have\nthat with a neural net anymore. But one thing that we can measure is hey, what is the mean squared\nerror, right? So if I come down here, and I compare the two mean squared errors, so\nso I can predict x test all right. So these are my predictions using that linear regressor,\nwill linear multiple multiple linear regressor. So these are my live predictions, linear regression.\nOkay. I'm actually going to do that at the bottom. So let me just copy and paste that cell and bring\nit down here. So now I'm going to calculate the mean squared error for both the linear regressor\nand the neural net. Okay, so this is my linear and this is my neural net. So if I do my neural net\nmodel, and I predict x test all, I get my two, you know, different y predictions. And I can calculate\nthe mean squared error, right? So if I want to get the mean squared error, and I have y prediction\nand y real, I can do numpy dot square, and then I would need the y prediction minus, you know, the\nreal. So this this is basically squaring everything. And this should be a vector. So if I just take\nthis entire thing and take the mean of that, that should give me the MSC. So let's just try that out.\nAnd the y real is y test all, right? So that's my mean squared error for the linear regressor.\nAnd this is my mean squared error for the neural net. So that's interesting. I will debug this live,\nI guess. So my guess is that it's probably coming from this normalization layer. Because this input\nshape is probably just six. And okay, so that works now. And the reason why is because, like,\nmy inputs are only for every vector, it's only a one dimensional vector of length six. So I should\nhave I should have just had six, comma, which is a tuple of size six from the start, or it's a it's\na tuple containing one element, which is a six. Okay, so it's actually interesting that my neural\nnet results seem like they they have a larger mean squared error than my linear regressor.\nOne thing that we can look at is, we can actually plot the real versus, you know, the the actual\nresults versus what the predictions are. So if I say, some access, and I use plt dot axes, and make\naxes and make these equal, then I can scatter the the y, you know, the test. So what the actual\nvalues are on the x axis, and then what the prediction are on the x axis. Okay. And I can\nlabel this as the linear regression predictions. Okay, so then let me just label my axes. So the\nx axis, I'm going to say is the true values. The y axis is going to be my linear regression predictions.\nOr actually, let's plot. Let's just make this predictions.\nAnd then at the end, I'm going to plot. Oh, let's set some limits.\nBecause I think that's like approximately the max number of bikes.\nSo I'm going to set my x limit to this and my y limit to this.\nSo here, I'm going to pass that in here too. And all right, this is what we actually get for our\nlinear regressor. You see that actually, they align quite well, I mean, to some extent. So 2000 is\nprobably too much 2500. I mean, looks like maybe like 1800 would be enough here for our limits.\nAnd I'm actually going to label something else, the neural net predictions.\nLet's add a legend. So you can see that our neural net for the larger values, it seems like\nit's a little bit more spread out. And it seems like we tend to underestimate a little bit down\nhere in this area. Okay. And for some reason, these are way off as well.\nBut yeah, so we've basically used a linear regressor and a neural net. Honestly, there are\nsometimes where a neural net is more appropriate and a linear regressor is more appropriate.\nI think that it just comes with time and trying to figure out, you know, and just literally seeing\nlike, hey, what works better, like here, a linear, a multiple linear regressor might actually work\nbetter than a neural net. But for example, with the one dimensional case, a linear regressor would\nnever be able to see this curve. Okay. I mean, I'm not saying this is a great model either, but I'm\njust saying like, hey, you know, sometimes it might be more appropriate to use something that's not\nlinear. So yeah, I will leave regression at that. Okay, so we just talked about supervised learning.\nAnd in supervised learning, we have data, we have some a bunch of features and for a bunch of\ndifferent samples. But each of those samples has some sort of label on it, whether that's a number,\na category, a class, etc. Right, we were able to use that label in order to try to predict\nright, we were able to use that label in order to try to predict new labels of other points that\nwe haven't seen yet. Well, now let's move on to unsupervised learning. So with unsupervised\nlearning, we have a bunch of unlabeled data. And what can we do with that? You know, can we learn\nanything from this data? So the first algorithm that we're going to discuss is known as k means\nclustering. What k means clustering is trying to do is it's trying to compute k clusters from the data.\nSo in this example below, I have a bunch of scattered points. And you'll see that this\nis x zero and x one on the two axes, which means I'm actually plotting two different features,\nright of each point, but we don't know what the y label is for those points. And now, just looking\nat these scattered points, we can kind of see how there are different clusters in the data set,\nright. So depending on what we pick for k, we might have different clusters. Let's say k equals two,\nright, then we might pick, okay, this seems like it could be one cluster, but this here is also\nanother cluster. So those might be our two different clusters. If we have k equals three,\nfor example, then okay, this seems like it could be a cluster. This seems like it could be a\ncluster. And maybe this could be a cluster, right. So we could have three different clusters in the\ndata set. Now, this k here is predefined, if I can spell that correctly, by the person who's running\nthe model. So that would be you. All right. And let's discuss how you know, the computer actually\ngoes through and computes the k clusters. So I'm going to write those steps down here.\nNow, the first step that happens is we actually choose well, the computer chooses three random\npoints on this plot to be the centroids. And by centuries, I just mean the center of the clusters.\nOkay. So three random points, let's say we're doing k equals three, so we're choosing three\nrandom points to be the centroids of the three clusters. If it were two, we'd be choosing two\nrandom points. Okay. So maybe the three random points I'm choosing might be here.\nHere, here, and here. All right. So we have three different points. And the second thing that we do\nis we actually calculate\nthe distance for each point to those centroids. So between all the points and the centroid.\nSo basically, I'm saying, all right, this is this distance, this distance, this distance,\nall of these distances, I'm computing between oops, not those two, between the points, not the\ncentroids themselves. So I'm computing the distances for all of these plots to each of the centroids.\nOkay. And that comes with also assigning those points to the closest centroid.\nWhat do I mean by that? So let's take this point here, for example, so I'm computing\nthis distance, this distance, and this distance. And I'm saying, okay, it seems like the red one\nis the closest. So I'm actually going to put this into the red centroid. So if I do that for\nall of these points, it seems slightly closer to red, and this one seems slightly closer to red,\nright? Now for the blue, I actually wouldn't put any blue ones in here, but we would probably\nactually, that first one is closer to red. And now it seems like the rest of them are probably\ncloser to green. So let's just put all of these into green here, like that. And cool. So now we\nhave, you know, our two, three, technically centroid. So there's this group here, there's\nthis group here. And then blue is kind of just this group here, it hasn't really touched any\nof the points yet. So the next step, three that we do is we actually go and we recalculate the\ncentroid. So we compute new centroids based on the points that we have in all the centroids.\nAnd by that, I just mean, okay, well, let's take the average of all these points. And where is that\nnew centroid? That's probably going to be somewhere around here, right? The blue one, we don't have\nany points in there. So we won't touch and then the screen one, we can put that probably somewhere\nover here, oops, somewhere over here. Right. So now if I erase all of the previously computed centroids,\nI can go and I can actually redo step two over here, this calculation.\nAlright, so I'm going to go back and I'm going to iterate through everything again,\nand I'm going to recompute my three centroids. So let's see, we're going to take this red point,\nthese are definitely all red, right? This one still looks a bit red. Now,\nthis part, we actually start getting closer to the blues.\nSo this one still seems closer to a blue than a green, this one as well. And I think the rest\nwould belong to green. Okay, so now our three centroids are three, sorry, our three clusters\nwould be this, this, and then this, right? Those are our three centroids. And so now we go back\nand we compute the new sorry, those would be the three clusters. So now we go back and we compute\nthe three centroids. So I'm going to get rid of this, this and this. And now where would this\nred be centered, probably closer, you know, to this point here, this blue might be closer to\nup here. And then this green would probably be somewhere. It's pretty similar to what we had\nbefore. But it seems like it'd be pulled down a bit. So probably somewhere around there for green.\nAll right. And now, again, we go back and we compute the distance between all the points\nand the centroids. And then we assign them to the closest centroid. Okay. So the reds are all here,\nit's very clear. Actually, let me just circle that. And this it actually seems like this point is\nit actually seemed like this point is closer to this blue now. So the blues seem like they would\nbe maybe this point looks like it'd be blue. So all these look like they would be blue now.\nAnd the greens would probably be this cluster right here. So we go back, we compute the centroids,\nbam. This one probably like almost here, bam. And then the green looks like it would be probably\nhere ish. Okay. And now we go back and we compute the we compute the clusters again.\nSo red, still this blue, I would argue is now this cluster here. And green is this cluster here.\nOkay, so we go and we recompute the centroids, bam, bam. And, you know, bam. And now if I were\nto go and assign all the points to clusters again, I would get the exact same thing. Right. And so\nthat's when we know that we can stop iterating between steps two and three is when we've\nconverged on some solution when we've reached some stable point. And so now because none of\nthese points are really changing out of their clusters anymore, we can go back to the user\nand say, Hey, these are our three clusters. Okay. And this process, something known as\nexpectation maximization. This part where we're assigning the points to the closest centroid,\nthis is something this is our expectation step. And this part where we're computing the new\ncentroids, this is our maximization step. Okay, so that's expectation maximization.\nAnd we use this in order to compute the centroids, assign all the points to clusters,\naccording to those centroids. And then we're recomputing all that over again, until we reach\nsome stable point where nothing is changing anymore. Alright, so that's our first example\nof unsupervised learning. And basically, what this is doing is trying to find some structure,\nsome pattern in the data. So if I came up with another point, you know, might be somewhere here,\nI can say, Oh, it looks like that's closer to if this is a, b, c, it looks like that's closest to\ncluster B. And so I would probably put it in cluster B. Okay, so we can find some structure\nin the data based on just how, how the points are scattered relative to one another. Now,\nthe second unsupervised learning technique that I'm going to discuss with you guys, something noted,\nprincipal component analysis. And the point of principal component analysis is very often it's\nused as a dimensionality reduction technique. So let me write that down. It's used for dimensionality\nreduction. And what do I mean by dimensionality reduction is if I have a bunch of features like\nx1 x2 x3 x4, etc. Can I just reduce that down to one dimension that gives me the most information\nabout how all these points are spread relative to one another. And that's what PCA is for. So PCA\nprincipal component analysis. Let's say I have some points in the x zero and x one feature space.\nOkay, so these points might be spread, you know, something like this.\nOkay. So for example, if this were something to do with housing prices, right,\nthis here might be x zero might be hey, years since built, right, since the house was built,\nand x one might be square footage of the house. Alright, so like years since built, I mean, like\nright now it's been, you know, 22 years since a house in 2000 was built. Now principal component\nanalysis is just saying, alright, let's say we want to build a model, or let's say we want to,\nyou know, display something about our data, but we don't we don't have two axes to show it on.\nHow do we display, you know, how do we how do we demonstrate that this point is a further away from\nthis point than this point. And we can do that using principal component analysis. So\ntake what you know about linear regression and just forget about it for a second. Otherwise,\nyou might get confused. PCA is a way of trying to find direction in the space with the largest\nvariance. So this principal component, what that means is basically the component.\nSo some direction in this space with the largest variance, okay, it tells us the most about our\ndata set without the two different dimensions. Like, let's say we have these two different\nmentions, and somebody's telling us, hey, you only get one dimension in order to show your data set.\nWhat dimension do you want to show us? Okay, so let's say we want to show our data set,\nwhat dimension like what do we do, we want to project our data onto a single dimension.\nAlright, so that in this case might be a dimension that looks something like\nthis. And you might say, okay, we're not going to talk about linear regression, okay.\nWe don't have a y value. So linear regression, this would be why this is not why, okay, we don't\nhave a label for that. Instead, what we're doing is we're taking the right angle projection. So\nall of these take that's not very visible. But take this right angle projection onto this line.\nAnd what PCA is doing is saying, okay, map all of these points onto this one dimensional space.\nSo the transformed data set would be here.\nThis one's on the data sets are on the line. So we just put that there. But now this would be our\nnew one dimensional data set. Okay, it's not our prediction or anything. This is our new data set.\nIf somebody came to us said you only get one dimension, you only get one number to represent\neach of these 2d points. What number would you give us? What number would you give us?\nSo this would be our new one dimensional data set. Okay, it's not our prediction or anything.\nWhat number would you give me? This would be the number that we gave. Okay, this in this direction,\nthis is where our points are the most spread out. Right? If I took this plot,\nand let me actually duplicate this so I don't have to rewrite anything.\nOr so I don't have to erase and then redraw anything. Let me get rid of some of this stuff.\nAnd I just got rid of a point there too. So let me draw that back.\nAlright, so if this were my original data point, what if I had taken, you know, this to be\nthe PCA dimension? Okay, well, I then would have points that let me actually do that in different\ncolor. So if I were to draw a right angle to this for every point, my points would look something\nlike this. And so just intuitively looking at these two different plots, this top one and this one,\nwe can see that the points are squished a little bit closer together. Right? Which means that the\nvariance that's not the space with the largest variance. The thing about the largest variance\nis that this will give us the most discrimination between all of these points. The larger the\nvariance, the further spread out these points will likely be. Now, and so that's the that's the\ndimension that we should project it on a different way to actually look at that, like what is the\ndimension with the largest variance. It's actually it also happens to be the dimension that decreases\nto be the dimension that decreases that minimizes the residuals. So if we take all the points, and\nwe take the residual from that the XY residual, so in linear regression, in linear regression,\nwe were looking only at this residual, the differences between the predictions right between\ny and y hat, it's not that here in principal component analysis, we're taking the difference\nfrom our current point in two dimensional space, and then it's projected point. Okay, so we're\ntaking that dimension. And we're saying, alright, how much, you know, how much distance is there\nbetween that projection residual, and we're trying to minimize that for all of these points. So that\nactually equates to this largest variance dimension, this dimension here, the PCA dimension,\nyou can either look at it as minimizing, minimize, let me get rid of this,\nthe projection residuals. So that's the stuff in orange.\nOr to maximizing the variance between the points.\nOkay. And we're not really going to talk about, you know, the method that we need in order to\ncalculate out the principal components, or like what that projection would be, because you will\nneed to understand linear algebra for that, especially eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which\nI'm not going to cover in this class. But that's how you would find the principal components. Okay,\nnow, with this two dimensional data set here, sorry, this one dimensional data set, we started\nfrom a 2d data set, and we now boil it down to one dimension. Well, we can go and take that\ndimension, and we can do other things with it. Right, we can, like if there were a y label,\nthen we can now show x versus y, rather than x zero and x one in different plots with that y.\nNow we can just say, oh, this is a principal component. And we're going to plot that with\nthe y. Or for example, if there were 100 different dimensions, and you only wanted to take five of\nthem, well, you could go and you could find the top five PCA dimensions. And that might be a lot\nmore useful to you than 100 different feature vector values. Right. So that's principal component\nanalysis. Again, we're taking, you know, certain data that's unlabeled, and we're trying to make\nsome sort of estimation, like some guess about its structure from that original data set, if we\nwanted to take, you know, a 3d thing, so like a sphere, but we only have a 2d surface to draw it\non. Well, what's the best approximation that we can make? Oh, it's a circle. Right PCA is kind of\nthe same thing. It's saying if we have something with all these different dimensions, but we can't\nshow all of them, how do we boil it down to just one dimension? How do we extract the most\ninformation from that multiple dimensions? And that is exactly either you minimize the projection\nresiduals, or you maximize the variance. And that is PCA. So we'll go through an example of that.\nNow, finally, let's move on to implementing the unsupervised learning part of this class.\nHere, again, I'm on the UCI machine learning repository. And I have a seeds data set where,\nyou know, I have a bunch of kernels that belong to three different types of wheat. So there's\ncomma, Rosa and Canadian. And the different features that we have access to are, you know,\ngeometric parameters of those wheat kernels. So the area perimeter, compactness, length, width,\nwidth, asymmetry, and the length of the kernel groove. Okay, so all of these are real values,\nwhich is easy to work with. And what we're going to do is we're going to try to predict,\nor I guess we're going to try to cluster the different varieties of the wheat.\nSo let's get started. I have a colab notebook open again. Oh, you're gonna have to, you know,\ngo to the data folder, download this. And so I'm going to go to the data folder, download this,\nand let's get started. So the first thing to do is to import our seeds data set into our colab\nnotebook. So I've done that here. Okay, and then we're going to import all the classics again,\nso pandas. And then I'm also going to import seedborn because I'm going to want that for this\nspecific class. Okay. Great. So now our columns that we have in our seed data set are the area,\nthe perimeter, the compactness, the length, with asymmetry, groove, length, I mean, I'm just going\nto call it groove. And then the class, right, the wheat kernels class. So now we have to import this,\nI'm going to do that using pandas read CSV. And it's called seeds data.csv. So I'm going to turn\nthat into a data frame. And the names are equal to the columns over here. So what happens if I just\ndo that? Oops, what did I call this seeds data set text? Alright, so if we actually look at our\ndata frame right now, you'll notice something funky. Okay. And here, you know, we have all the\nstuff under area. And these are all our numbers with some dash t. So the reason is because we\nhaven't actually told pandas what the separator is, which we can do like this. And this t that's\njust a tab. So in order to ensure that like all whitespace gets recognized as a separator,\nwe can actually this is for like a space. So any spaces are going to get recognized as data\nseparators. So if I run that, now our this, you know, this is a lot better. Okay. Okay.\nSo now let's actually go and like visualize this data. So what I'm actually going to do is plot\neach of these against one another. So in this case, pretend that we don't have access to the\nclass, right? Pretend that so this class here, I'm just going to show you in this example,\nthat like, hey, we can predict our classes using unsupervised learning. But for this example,\nin unsupervised learning, we don't actually have access to the class. So I'm going to just try to\nplot these against one another and see what happens. So for some I in range, you know,\nthe columns minus one because the classes in the columns. And I'm just going to say for j in range,\nso take everything from I onwards, you know, so I like the next thing after I until the end of this.\nSo this will give us basically a grid of all the different like combinations. And our x label is\ngoing to be columns I our y label is going to be the columns j. So those are our labels up here.\nAnd I'm going to use seaborne this time. And I'm going to say scatter my data. So our x is going\nto be our x label. Or y is going to be our y label. And our data is going to be the data frame that\nwe're passing in. So what's interesting here is that we can say hue. And what this will do is say,\nlike if I give this class, it's going to separate the three different classes into three different\nhues. So now what we're doing is we're basically comparing the area and the perimeter or the area\nand the compactness. But we're going to visualize, you know, what classes they're in. So let's go\nahead and I might have to show. So great. So basically, we can see perimeter and area we give\nwe get these three groups. The area compactness, we get these three groups, and so on. So these all\nkind of look honestly like somewhat similar. Right, so Wow, look at this one. So this one,\nwe have the compactness and the asymmetry. And it looks like there's not really I mean,\nit just looks like they're blobs, right? Sure, maybe class three is over here more, but\none and two kind of look like they're on top of each other. Okay. I mean, there are some that\nmight look slightly better in terms of clustering. But let's go through some of the some of the\nclustering examples that we talked about, and try to implement those. The first thing that we're\ngoing to do is just straight up clustering. So what we learned about was k means clustering.\nSo from SK learn, I'm going to import k means. Okay. And just for the sake of being able to run,\nyou know, any x and any y, I'm just going to say, hey, let's use some x. What's a good one, maybe.\nI mean, perimeter asymmetry could be a good one. So x could be perimeter, y could be asymmetry.\nOkay. And for this, the x values, I'm going to just extract those specific values.\nAlright, well, let's make a k means algorithm, or let's, you know, define this. So k means,\nand in this specific case, we know that the number of clusters is three. So let's just use that. And\nI'm going to fit this against this x that I've just defined right here. Right. So, you know, if I\ncreate this clusters, so one thing, one cool thing is I can actually go to this clusters, and I can\nsay k mean dot labels. And it'll give give me if I can type correctly, it'll give me what its\npredictions for all the clusters are. And our actual, oops, not that. If we go to the data frame,\nand we get the class, and the values from those, we can actually compare these two and say, hey,\nlike, you know, everything in general, most of the zeros that it's predicted, are the ones, right.\nAnd in general, the twos are the twos here. And then this third class one, okay, that corresponds\nto three. Now remember, these are separate classes. So the labels, what we actually call them don't\nreally matter. We can say a map zero to one map two to two and map one to three. Okay, and our,\nyou know, our mapping would do fairly well. But we can actually visualize this. And in order to do\nthat, I'm going to create this cluster cluster data frame. So I'm going to create a data frame.\nAnd I'm going to pass in a horizontally stacked array with x, so my values for x and y. And then\nthe clusters that I have here, but I'm going to reshape them. So it's 2d.\nOkay. And the columns, the labels for that are going to be x, y, and plus. Okay. So I'm going\nto go ahead and do that same seaborne scatter plot. Again, where x is x, y is y. And now,\nthe hue is again the class. And the data is now this cluster data frame. Alright, so this here,\nthis here is my k means like, I guess classes.\nSo k means kind of looks like this. If I come down here and I plot, you know, my original data frame,\nthis is my original classes with respect to this specific x and y. And you'll see that, honestly,\nlike it doesn't do too poorly. Yeah, there's I mean, the colors are different, but that's fine.\nFor the most part, it gets information of the clusters, right. And now we can do that with\nhigher dimensions. So with the higher dimensions, if we make x equal to, you know, all the columns,\nexcept for the last one, which is our class, we can do the exact same thing.\nWe can do the exact same thing. So here, and we can\npredict this. But now, our columns are equal to our data frame columns all the way to the last one.\nAnd then with this class, actually, so we can literally just say data frame columns.\nAnd we can fit all of this. And now, if I want to plot the k means classes.\nAlright, so this was my that's my clustered and my original. So actually, let me see if I can\nget these on the same page. So yeah, I mean, pretty similar to what we just saw. But what's\nactually really cool is even something like, you know, if we change. So what's one of them\nwhere they were like on top of each other? Okay, so compactness and asymmetry, this one's messy.\nRight. So if I come down here, and I say compactness and asymmetry, and I'm trying to do this in 2d,\nthis is what my scatterplot. So this is what you know, my k means is telling me for these two\ndimensions for compactness and asymmetry, if we just look at those two, these are our three classes,\nright? And we know that the original looks something like this. And are these two remotely\nalike? No. Okay, so now if I come back down here, and I rerun this higher dimensions one,\nbut actually, this clusters, I need to get the labels of the k means again.\nOkay, so if I rerun this with higher dimensions,\nwell, if we zoom out, and we take a look at these two, sure, the colors are mixed up. But in general,\nthere are the three groups are there, right? This does a much better job at assessing, okay,\nwhat group is what. So, for example, we could relabel the one in the original class to two.\nAnd then we could make sorry, okay, this is kind of confusing. But for example, if this light pink\nwere projected onto this darker pink here, and then this dark one was actually the light pink,\nand this light one was this dark one, then you kind of see like these correspond to one another,\nright? Like even these two up here are the same class as all the other ones over here, which are\nthe same in the same color. So you don't want to compare the two colors between the plots,\nyou want to compare which points are in what colors in each of the plots. So that's one cool\napplication. So this is how k means functions, it's basically taking all the data sets and saying,\nAll right, where are my clusters given these pieces of data? And then the next thing that we\ntalked about is PCA. So PCA, we're reducing the dimension, but we're mapping all these like,\nyou know, seven dimensions. I don't know if there are seven, I made that number up, but we're\nmapping multiple dimensions into a lower dimension number. Right. And so let's see how that works.\nSo from SK learn decomposition, I can import PCA and that will be my PCA model.\nSo if I do PCA component, so this is how many dimensions you want to map it into.\nAnd you know, for this exercise, let's do two. Okay, so now I'm taking the top two dimensions.\nAnd my transformed x is going to be PCA dot fit transform, and the same x that I had up here.\nAnd the same x that I had up here. Okay, so all the other all the values basically, area,\nperimeter, compactness, length, width, asymmetry, groove. Okay. So let's run that. And we've\ntransformed it. So let's look at what the shape of x used to be. So they're okay. So seven was right,\nI had 210 samples, each seven, seven features long, basically. And now my transformed x\nis 210 samples, but only of length two, which means that I only have two dimensions now that\nI'm plotting. And we can actually even take a look at, you know, the first five things.\nOkay, so now we see each each one is a two dimensional point,\neach sample is now a two dimensional point in our new in our new dimensions.\nSo what's cool is I can actually scatter these\nzero and transformed x. So I actually have to\ntake the columns here. And if I show that,\nbasically, we've just taken this like seven dimensional thing, and we've made it into a\nsingle or I guess to a two dimensional representation. So that's a point of PCA.\nAnd actually, let's go ahead and do the same clustering exercise as we did up here. If I take\nthe k means this PCA data frame, I can let's construct data frame out of that. And the data\nframe is going to be H stack. I'm going to take this transformed x and the clusters that reshape.\nSo actually, instead of clusters, I'm going to use k means dot labels. And I need to reshape this.\nSo it's 2d. So we can do the H stack. And for the columns, I'm going to set this to PCA one PCA two,\nand the class. All right. So now if I take this, I can also do the same for the truth.\nBut instead of the k means labels, I want from the data frame the original classes.\nAnd I'm just going to take the values from that. And so now I have a data frame for the k means\nwith PCA and then a data frame for the truth with also the PCA. And I can now plot these similarly\nto how I plotted these up here. So let me actually take these two.\nInstead of the cluster data frame, I want the this is the k means PCA data frame. This is still going\nto be class, but now x and y are going to be the two PCA dimensions. Okay. So these are my two PCA\ndimensions. And you can see that the data frame is going to be the same as the cluster data frame.\nSo these are my two PCA dimensions. And you can see that, you know, they're, they're pretty spread\nout. And then here, I'm going to go to my truth classes. Again, it's PCA one PCA two, but instead\nof k means this should be truth PCA data frame. So you can see that like in the truth data frame\nalong these two dimensions, we actually are doing fairly well in terms of separation, right? It does\nseem like this is slightly more separable than the other like dimensions that we had been looking at\nup here. So that's a good sign. And up here, you can see that hey, some of these correspond to one\nanother. I mean, for the most part, our algorithm or unsupervised clustering algorithm is able to\nto give us is able to spit out, you know, what the proper labels are. I mean, if you map these\nspecific labels to the different types of kernels. But for example, this one might all be the comma\nkernel kernels and same here. And then these might all be the Canadian kernels. And these might all\nbe the Canadian kernels. So it does struggle a little bit with, you know, where they overlap.\nBut for the most part, our algorithm is able to find the three different categories, and do a\nfairly good job at predicting them without without any information from us, we haven't given our\nalgorithm any labels. So that's a gist of unsupervised learning. I hope you guys enjoyed\nthis course. I hope you know, a lot of these examples made sense. If there are certain things\nthat I have done, and you know, you're somebody with more experience than me, please let me know\nin the comments and we can all as a community learn from this together. So thank you all for watching."

any new points that I see over here will basically be\nthat I see over here will basically be\nthat I see over here will basically be my predicted point with respect to Y so\nmy predicted point with respect to Y so\nmy predicted point with respect to Y so in this way we basically solve a\nin this way we basically solve a\nin this way we basically solve a regression problem statement so this is\nregression problem statement so this is\nregression problem statement so this is very much important to understand let's\nvery much important to understand let's\nvery much important to understand let's go to the always understand in a\ngo to the always understand in a\ngo to the always understand in a regression problem statement your output\nregression problem statement your output\nregression problem statement your output will be a continuous variable the second\nwill be a continuous variable the second\nwill be a continuous variable the second one is basically a classification\none is basically a classification\none is basically a classification problem now in classification problem\nproblem now in classification problem\nproblem now in classification problem suppose I have a data set let's say that\nsuppose I have a data set let's say that\nsuppose I have a data set let's say that number of hours study number of study\nnumber of hours study number of study\nnumber of hours study number of study hours number of play\nhours number of play\nhours number of play hours so this is my independent feature\nhours so this is my independent feature\nhours so this is my independent feature let's say a number of sleeping hours and\nlet's say a number of sleeping hours and\nlet's say a number of sleeping hours and finally I have my output which will will\nfinally I have my output which will will\nfinally I have my output which will will be pass or fail so in this I have all\nbe pass or fail so in this I have all\nbe pass or fail so in this I have all this as my independent features and this\nthis as my independent features and this\nthis as my independent features and this is my dependent feature so I will be\nis my dependent feature so I will be\nis my dependent feature so I will be having some values like this and here\nhaving some values like this and here\nhaving some values like this and here either you'll be pass or fail or pass or\neither you'll be pass or fail or pass or\neither you'll be pass or fail or pass or fail now whenever you have in your\nfail now whenever you have in your\nfail now whenever you have in your output fixed number of categories then\noutput fixed number of categories then\noutput fixed number of categories then that becomes a classification problem\nthat becomes a classification problem\nthat becomes a classification problem suppose it just has two outputs then it\nsuppose it just has two outputs then it\nsuppose it just has two outputs then it becomes a binary classification if you\nbecomes a binary classification if you\nbecomes a binary classification if you have more than two different categories\nhave more than two different categories\nhave more than two different categories at that time it becomes a multiclass\nat that time it becomes a multiclass\nat that time it becomes a multiclass classification so this is the difference\nclassification so this is the

particular Point what did I\nis 1 at this particular Point what did I get J of theta 1 is nothing but zero so\nget J of theta 1 is nothing but zero so\nget J of theta 1 is nothing but zero so this will be my first point this will be\nthis will be my first point this will be\nthis will be my first point this will be my first point guys I have discussed why\nmy first point guys I have discussed why\nmy first point guys I have discussed why why the value will be 1X 2m basically to\nwhy the value will be 1X 2m basically to\nwhy the value will be 1X 2m basically to make the calculation simpler we are\nmake the calculation simpler we are\nmake the calculation simpler we are dividing by 1X 2 m is basically used to\ndividing by 1X 2 m is basically used to\ndividing by 1X 2 m is basically used to average aage is the sumission that we\naverage aage is the sumission that we\naverage aage is the sumission that we are actually doing over here now let's\nare actually doing over here now let's\nare actually doing over here now let's go ahead and let's take the second\ngo ahead and let's take the second\ngo ahead and let's take the second scenario in the second scenario let's\nscenario in the second scenario let's\nscenario in the second scenario let's consider my Theta 1 let's say that my\nconsider my Theta 1 let's say that my\nconsider my Theta 1 let's say that my Theta 1 over here is now 0.5 if my Theta\nTheta 1 over here is now 0.5 if my Theta\nTheta 1 over here is now 0.5 if my Theta 1 is 0.5 then tell me what are the\n1 is 0.5 then tell me what are the\n1 is 0.5 then tell me what are the points that I will get for x equal to\npoints that I will get for x equal to\npoints that I will get for x equal to 1.5 * 1 so it will come as 0.5 over\n1.5 * 1 so it will come as 0.5 over\n1.5 * 1 so it will come as 0.5 over here right then similarly when X is\nhere right then similarly when X is\nhere right then similarly when X is equal to 2.5 * 2 is nothing but 1 over\nequal to 2.5 * 2 is nothing but 1 over\nequal to 2.5 * 2 is nothing but 1 over here and then similarly when uh for x\nhere and then similarly when uh for x\nhere and then similarly when uh for x equal to\nequal to\nequal to 35 multiplied by 3 see we are\n35 multiplied by 3 see we are\n35 multiplied by 3 see we are multiplying here right5 multi by 3 is\nmultiplying here right5 multi by 3 is\nmultiplying here right5 multi by 3 is 1.5 so the next point will come over\n1.5 so the next point will come over\n1.5 so the next point will come over here now when I create my best fit line\nhere now when I create my best fit line\nhere now when I create my best fit line what will happen so here is my next best\nwhat will happen so here is my next best\nwhat will happen so here is my next best fit line which I will probably create by\nfit line which I will probably create by\nfit line which I will probably create by green\ngreen\ngreen color okay so this is my second one\ncolor okay so this is my second one\ncolor okay so this is my second one which is green color here definitely\nwhich is green color here definitely\nwhich is green color here definitely slope is decreasing so if I go ahead and\nslope is decreasing so if I go ahead and\nslope is decreasing so if I go ahead and calculate my J of theta let's see what\ncalculate my J of theta let's see what\ncalculate my J of theta let's see what I'll get so J of theta\nI'll get so J of theta\nI'll get so J of theta 1 is nothing but 1X 2\n1 is nothing but 1X 2\n1 is nothing but 1X 2 m again same equation summation of I = 1\nm again same equation summation of I = 1\nm again same equation summation of I = 1 2 3 H Theta of X of\n2 3 H Theta of X of\n2 3 H Theta of X of i - y of\ni - y of\ni - y of i² so what we have for over here we have\ni² so what we have for over here we have\ni² so what we have for over here we have nothing but 1X 2 m now let's do the\nnothing but 1X 2 m now let's do the\nnothing but 1X 2 m now let's do the summation what is this point this point\nsummation what is this point this point\nsummation what is this point this point is nothing but the predicted point and\nis nothing but the predicted point and\nis nothing but the predicted point and this point is the real point right so in\nthis point is the real point right so in\nthis point is the real point right so in this particular scenario the first point\nthis particular scenario the first point\nthis particular scenario the first point that I will get is nothing but. 5 - 1\nthat I will get is nothing but. 5 - 1\nthat I will get is nothing but. 5 - 1 whole s how I'm getting. 5 - 1 whole\nwhole s how I'm getting. 5 - 1 whole\nwhole s how I'm getting. 5 - 1 whole Square this is 1 this is the real Point\nSquare this is 1 this is the real Point\nSquare this is 1 this is the real Point 1 this is the predicted Point .5 so here\n1 this is the predicted Point .5 so here\n1 this is the predicted Point .5 so here I'm getting. 5 - 1 whole Square the\nI'm getting. 5 - 1 whole Square the\nI'm getting. 5 - 1 whole Square the second point will be 1 - 2 whole s right\nsecond point will be 1 - 2 whole s right\nsecond point will be 1 - 2 whole s right 2 so 1 - 2 whole\n2 so 1 - 2 whole\n2 so 1 - 2 whole s and then I will finally get 1.5 - 3\ns and then I will finally get 1.5 - 3\ns and then I will finally get 1.5 - 3 whole s so finally if I do this\nwhole s so finally if I do this\nwhole s so finally if I do this calculation how much I'm actually\ncalculation how much I'm actually\ncalculation how much I'm actually getting 1X 2 * 3 which is 6 here I'm\ngetting 1X 2 * 3 which is 6 here I'm\ngetting 1X 2 * 3 which is 6 here I'm getting\ngetting\ngetting .25 5 Square here I'm getting 1 here I'm\n.25 5 Square here I'm getting 1 here I'm\n.25 5 Square here I'm getting 1 here I'm getting 1.5 whole Square so my final\ngetting 1.5 whole Square so my final\ngetting 1.5 whole Square so my final output will be which I have already\noutput will be which I have already\noutput will be which I have already calculated it is nothing but point it\ncalculated it is nothing but point it\ncalculated it is nothing but point it will be approximately equal to. 58 so 58\nwill be approximately equal to. 58 so 58\nwill be approximately equal to. 58 so 58 now with Theta as this is nothing but\nnow with Theta as this is nothing

you\nrepeat until convergence I told you\nrepeat until convergence I told you right here we have written this\nright here we have written this\nright here we have written this algorithm\nalgorithm\nalgorithm and now let's take it for Theta 0 and\nand now let's take it for Theta 0 and\nand now let's take it for Theta 0 and Theta 1 so here I will write Theta 0\nTheta 1 so here I will write Theta 0\nTheta 1 so here I will write Theta 0 J equal to Theta\nJ equal to Theta\nJ equal to Theta J minus learning rate of derivative of\nJ minus learning rate of derivative of\nJ minus learning rate of derivative of theta\nJ J of theta 0 and Theta 1 so this is my\nJ J of theta 0 and Theta 1 so this is my repeat until convergence now we really\nrepeat until convergence now we really\nrepeat until convergence now we really need to find out what we'll try to\nneed to find out what we'll try to\nneed to find out what we'll try to equate we'll try to first of all find\nequate we'll try to first of all find\nequate we'll try to first of all find out what is this\nout what is this\nout what is this now if I really want to find out\nnow if I really want to find out\nnow if I really want to find out derivative\nderivative\nderivative of derivative of derivative of theta J\nof derivative of derivative of theta J\nof derivative of derivative of theta J with respect to J of theta 0 and Theta 1\nwith respect to J of theta 0 and Theta 1\nwith respect to J of theta 0 and Theta 1 so how do I write this I can definitely\nso how do I write this I can definitely\nso how do I write this I can definitely write this in a easy way okay so this\nwrite this in a easy way okay so this\nwrite this in a easy way okay so this will be derivative of theta J and\nwill be derivative of theta J and\nwill be derivative of theta J and remember J will be 0 and 1 right because\nremember J will be 0 and 1 right because\nremember J will be 0 and 1 right because we need to find out for 0 Theta 0 and\nwe need to find out for 0 Theta 0 and\nwe need to find out for 0 Theta 0 and Theta 1 so this will be 1 by 2 m what is\nTheta 1 so this will be 1 by 2 m what is\nTheta 1 so this will be 1 by 2 m what is what is J of theta 0a Theta 1 obviously\nwhat is J of theta 0a Theta 1 obviously\nwhat is J of theta 0a Theta 1 obviously my cost function so I will write\nmy cost function so I will write\nmy cost function so I will write summation of IAL 1 to M and here I will\nsummation of IAL 1 to M and here I will\nsummation of IAL 1 to M and here I will basically write J of theta of X of I\nbasically write J of theta of X of I\nbasically write J of theta of X of I minus y of I whole squar so if my J is\nminus y of I whole squar so if my J is\nminus y of I whole squar so if my J is equal to Z so what will happen for this\nequal to Z so what will happen for this\nequal to Z so what will happen for this so here I can specifically say that\nso here I can specifically say that\nso here I can specifically say that derivative of derivative of theta 0 J of\nderivative of derivative of theta 0 J of\nderivative of derivative of theta 0 J of theta 0a 1\ntheta 0a 1\ntheta 0a 1 now it's simple here what I will be\nnow it's simple here what I will be\nnow it's simple here what I will be doing is that I will be simply applying\ndoing is that I will be simply applying\ndoing is that I will be simply applying derivative function see guys what is\nderivative function see guys what is\nderivative function see guys what is this derivative let's consider this is\nthis derivative let's consider this is\nthis derivative let's consider this is something like this 1X 2 m x² so if I\nsomething like this 1X 2 m x² so if I\nsomething like this 1X 2 m x² so if I try to find out the derivative this will\ntry to find out the derivative this will\ntry to find out the derivative this will be 2x 2 MX so 2 and 2 will get cancel so\nbe 2x 2 MX so 2 and 2 will get cancel so\nbe 2x 2 MX so 2 and 2 will get cancel so similarly I'll have 1 by m and here I\nsimilarly I'll have 1 by m and here I\nsimilarly I'll have 1 by m and here I will specifically be writing summation\nwill specifically be writing summation\nwill specifically be writing summation of I = 1 2 m h Theta of x X of I which\nof I = 1 2 m h Theta of x X of I which\nof I = 1 2 m h Theta of x X of I which will be my\nwill be my\nwill be my x - y of i² so this will be my\nx - y of i² so this will be my\nx - y of i² so this will be my derivative with respect to Theta 0 this\nderivative with respect to Theta 0 this\nderivative with respect to Theta 0 this is what I got now the second thing will\nis what I got now the second thing will\nis what I got now the second thing will be that when J is equal to 1 derivative\nbe that when J is equal to 1 derivative\nbe that when J is equal to 1 derivative of derivative of theta 1 J of theta 0\nof derivative of theta 1 J of theta 0\nof derivative of theta 1 J of theta 0 comma Theta\ncomma Theta\ncomma Theta 1 in this particular case I will be\n1 in this particular case I will be\n1 in this particular case I will be having 1 by m summation of I = 1 to M\nhaving 1 by m summation of I = 1 to M\nhaving 1 by m summation of I = 1 to M then again see in this particular case\nthen again see in this particular case\nthen again see in this particular case Theta of 1 is there right Theta of 1\nTheta of 1 is there right Theta of 1\nTheta of 1 is there right Theta of 1 basically means what if I try to replace\nbasically means what if I try to replace\nbasically means what if I try to replace this let's say that I'm trying to\nthis let's say that I'm trying to\nthis let's say that I'm trying to replace this H Theta of X with something\nreplace this H Theta of X with something\nreplace this H Theta of X with something else what is s Theta of X I know that\nelse what is s Theta of X I know that\nelse what is s Theta of X I know that right it is Theta 0 + Theta 1 * X so\nright it is Theta 0 + Theta 1 * X so\nright it is Theta 0 + Theta 1 * X so Theta 0 + Theta 1 * X so after this if\nTheta 0 + Theta 1 * X so after this if\nTheta 0 + Theta 1 * X so after this if I'm trying to find out the derivative\nI'm trying to find out the derivative\nI'm trying to find out the derivative with respect to Theta 0 this will\nwith respect to Theta 0 this will\nwith respect to Theta 0 this will obviously become I will be able to get\nobviously become I will be able to get\nobviously become I will be able to get this much right now with respect to the\nthis much right now with respect to the\nthis much right now with respect to the second derivative what I will be writing\nsecond derivative what I will be writing\nsecond derivative what I will be writing I will again be writing H thet of X of i\nI will again be writing H thet of X of i\nI will again be writing H thet of X of i - y of i s\n- y of i s\n- y of i s multiplied X of I so this Square also\nmultiplied X of I so this Square also\nmultiplied X of I so this Square also went off understand this H Theta of X is\nwent off understand this H Theta of X is\nwent off understand this H Theta of X is what see they H Theta of X is nothing\nwhat see they H Theta of X is nothing\nwhat see they H Theta of X is nothing but Theta 0 + Theta 1 * X so if I'm\nbut Theta 0 + Theta 1 * X so if I'm\nbut Theta 0 + Theta 1 * X so if I'm trying to find out derivative with\ntrying to find out derivative with\ntrying to find out derivative with respect to Theta 0 nothing will be going\nrespect to Theta 0 nothing will be going\nrespect to Theta 0 nothing will be going to come okay Theta 1 of X will become a\nto come okay Theta 1 of X will become a\nto come okay Theta 1 of X will become a constant in this particular case in this\nconstant in this particular case in this\nconstant in this particular case in this case because Theta 1 of X is there so if\ncase because Theta 1 of X is there so if\ncase because Theta 1 of X is there so if I try to find out derivative of theta 1\nI try to find out derivative of theta 1\nI try to find out derivative of theta 1 into X only I'll be getting X Y Square\ninto X only I'll be getting X Y Square\ninto X only I'll be getting X Y Square will not be there it's easy right X squ\nwill not be there it's easy right X squ\nwill not be there it's easy right X squ means 2x this is the derivative of x\nmeans 2x this is the derivative of x\nmeans 2x this is the derivative of x square right so that square went and 1X\nsquare right so that square went and 1X\nsquare right so that square went and 1X 2 1 2 by two got cancelled so this will\n2 1 2 by two got cancelled so this will\n2 1 2 by two got cancelled so

like let's say that my feature is something like uh\nthat my feature is something like uh\nthat my feature is something like uh let's say I have a price of a house okay\nlet's say I have a price of a house okay\nlet's say I have a price of a house okay so suppose this is my bedrooms how many\nso suppose this is my bedrooms how many\nso suppose this is my bedrooms how many bedrooms I have and this is basically\nbedrooms I have and this is basically\nbedrooms I have and this is basically the price of the house now if I if I\nthe price of the house now if I if I\nthe price of the house now if I if I probably solve this Pro problem I'll\nprobably solve this Pro problem I'll\nprobably solve this Pro problem I'll definitely get an R square value let's\ndefinitely get an R square value let's\ndefinitely get an R square value let's say the R square value is 85% let's say\nsay the R square value is 85% let's say\nsay the R square value is 85% let's say that my R square is 85% now what if if I\nthat my R square is 85% now what if if I\nthat my R square is 85% now what if if I add one more feature the one more\nadd one more feature the one more\nadd one more feature the one more feature basically says that okay if I\nfeature basically says that okay if I\nfeature basically says that okay if I add\nadd\nadd location location of the house will be\nlocation location of the house will be\nlocation location of the house will be definitely correlated with price so\ndefinitely correlated with price so\ndefinitely correlated with price so there is a definite chance that the R\nthere is a definite chance that the R\nthere is a definite chance that the R square value will increase let's say\nsquare value will increase let's say\nsquare value will increase let's say that R square will become 90% if I\nthat R square will become 90% if I\nthat R square will become 90% if I probably have this two specific feature\nprobably have this two specific feature\nprobably have this two specific feature and obviously it is basically increasing\nand obviously it is basically increasing\nand obviously it is basically increasing the R square because this is also\nthe R square because this is also\nthe R square because this is also correlated to price\ncorrelated to price\ncorrelated to price and let me change the example see first\nand let me change the example see first\nand let me change the example see first case I got by R square as 85% let's say\ncase I got by R square as 85% let's say\ncase I got by R square as 85% let's say now as soon as I added location I got\nnow as soon as I added location I got\nnow as soon as I added location I got 90% now let's say that I added one more\n90% now let's say that I added one more\n90% now let's say that I added one more feature which gender is going to stay\nfeature which gender is going to stay\nfeature which gender is going to stay gender like male or female is going to\ngender like male or female is going to\ngender like male or female is going to stay you know that gender is no way\nstay you know that gender is no way\nstay you know that gender is no way correlated to price but even though I\ncorrelated to price but even though I\ncorrelated to price but even though I add one feature there is a scenario that\nadd one feature there is a scenario that\nadd one feature there is a scenario that my R square will still increase and it\nmy R square will still increase and it\nmy R square will still increase and it may become\nmay become\nmay become 91% even though my feature is not that\n91% even though my feature is not that\n91% even though my feature is not that important even gender is not that\nimportant even gender is not that\nimportant even gender is not that important the R square formula Works in\nimportant the R square formula Works in\nimportant the R square formula Works in such a way that if I keep on adding\nsuch a way that if I keep on adding\nsuch a way that if I keep on adding features and that are not nowhere\nfeatures and that are not nowhere\nfeatures and that are not nowhere correlated this is obviously nowhere\ncorrelated this is obviously nowhere\ncorrelated this is obviously nowhere correlated this is not correlated with\ncorrelated this is not correlated with\ncorrelated this is not correlated with price then also what it does is that it\nprice then also what it does is that it\nprice then also what it does is that it is basically increasing my r² so this\nis basically increasing my r² so this\nis basically increasing my r² so this specific thing should not happen whether\nspecific thing should not happen whether\nspecific thing should not happen whether a male will stay or female will stay\na male will stay or female will stay\na male will stay or female will stay that does not matter at all still when\nthat does not matter at all still when\nthat does not matter at all still when you do the calculation the R square will\nyou do the calculation the R square will\nyou do the calculation the R square will still increase so in order to not impact\nstill increase so in order to not impact\nstill increase so in order to not impact the model because see now right now with\nthe model because see now right now with\nthe model because see now right now with this particular model where I have got\nthis particular model where I have got\nthis particular model where I have got 90% now as soon as I see R square as 91%\n90% now as soon as I see R square as 91%\n90% now as soon as I see R square as 91% because it is considering this\nbecause it is considering this\nbecause it is considering this particular gender so this model will be\nparticular gender so this model will be\nparticular gender so this model will be picked right because it is performing\npicked right because it is performing\npicked right because it is performing well and is giving you a better R square\nwell and is giving you a better R square\nwell and is giving you a better R square value but this should not happen because\nvalue but this should not happen because\nvalue but this should not happen because that is not at all corelated this model\nthat is not at all corelated this model\nthat is not at all corelated this model should have been picked so in order to\nshould have been picked so in order to\nshould have been picked so in order to prevent this situation what we do we\nprevent this situation what we do we\nprevent this situation what we do we basically Ally use something called as\nbasically Ally use something called as\nbasically Ally use something called as adjusted R square now what is this\nadjusted R square now what is this\nadjusted R square now what is this adjusted R square and how it will work\nadjusted R square and how it will work\nadjusted R square and how it will work I'll also show it to you very very nice\nI'll also show it to you very very nice\nI'll also show it to you very very nice concept of adjusted R square so adjusted\nconcept of adjusted R square so adjusted\nconcept of adjusted R square so adjusted R square R square\nR square R square\nR square R square adjusted

particular case my number of predictor was three now if my predictor\npredictor was three now if my predictor\npredictor was three now if my predictor is 2 I got the r squ as 90% so in this\nis 2 I got the r squ as 90% so in this\nis 2 I got the r squ as 90% so in this particular scenario what all the\nparticular scenario what all the\nparticular scenario what all the calculation will happen okay all the\ncalculation will happen okay all the\ncalculation will happen okay all the calculation will happen and let's say\ncalculation will happen and let's say\ncalculation will happen and let's say that my R square adjusted it'll be\nthat my R square adjusted it'll be\nthat my R square adjusted it'll be little bit less it'll be little bit less\nlittle bit less it'll be little bit

smaller number or sorry little bit uh smaller\nnumber or sorry little bit uh smaller\nnumber or sorry little bit uh smaller number right so now in this particular\nnumber right so now in this particular\nnumber right so now in this particular case if it is not correlated obviously\ncase if it is not correlated obviously\ncase if it is not correlated obviously this will be high when I'm increasing\nthis will be high when I'm increasing\nthis will be high when I'm increasing this so this will also be high let me\nthis so this will also be high let me\nthis so this will also be high let me write the equation something like this\nwrite the equation something like this\nwrite the equation something like this just a second so this will basically\nbe okay now why probably this value may\nbe okay now why probably this value may have decreased let me talk about this\nhave decreased let me talk about this\nhave decreased let me talk about this one what is r squ I hope everybody\none what is r squ I hope everybody\none what is r squ I hope everybody understood n is the number of data\nunderstood n is the number of data\nunderstood n is the number of data points p is the number of\npoints p is the number of\npoints p is the number of predictors if p is increasing then what\npredictors if p is increasing then what\npredictors if p is increasing then what will happen as P

will basically get some values\nnumber we will basically get some values\nnumber we will basically get some values which will be decreasing if my P value\nwhich will be decreasing if my P value\nwhich will be decreasing if my P value is two in this particular case it will\nis two in this particular case it will\nis two in this particular case it will be less smaller than this right at least\nbe less smaller than this right at least\nbe less smaller than this right at least it will be greater than this this\nit will be greater than this this\nit will be greater than this this particular value right when p is equal\nparticular value right when p is equal\nparticular value right when p is equal to\nto\nto 3 so with the help of P obviously R\n3 so with the help of P obviously R\n3 so with the help of P obviously R square is there to support you okay\nsquare is there to support you okay\nsquare is there to support you okay whether it is correlated or not always\nwhether it is correlated or not always\nwhether it is correlated or not always remember when the features are highly\nremember when the features are highly\nremember when the features are highly correlated your R square value will\ncorrelated your R square value will\ncorrelated your R square value will increase tremendously if it is less\nincrease tremendously if it is less\nincrease tremendously if it is less correlated then it will be there will be\ncorrelated then it will be there will be\ncorrelated then it will be there will be a small increase but there will not be a\na small increase but there will not be a\na small increase but there will not be a very huge increase now if I consider p\nvery huge increase now if I consider p\nvery huge increase now if I consider p is equal to 2 obviously when I'm trying\nis equal to 2 obviously when I'm trying\nis equal to 2 obviously when I'm trying to find out this uh calculation n minus\nto find out this uh calculation n minus\nto find out this uh calculation n minus P minus 1 it will obviously be greater\nP minus 1 it will obviously be greater\nP minus 1 it will obviously be greater than p is equal to 3 when p is equal to\nthan p is equal to 3 when p is equal to\nthan p is equal to 3 when p is equal to 3 then this value will be still more\n3 then this value will be still more\n3 then this value will be still more smaller and when we are dividing a\nsmaller and when we are dividing a\nsmaller and when we are dividing a bigger number by a smaller number\nbigger number by a smaller number\nbigger number by a smaller number obviously we are subtracting with one so\nobviously we are subtracting with one so\nobviously we are subtracting with one so that basically means even though my R\nthat basically means even though my R\nthat basically means even though my R square is 86 over here there may be a\nsquare is 86 over here there may be a\nsquare is 86 over here there may be a scenario since this is nowhere\nscenario since this is nowhere\nscenario since this is nowhere correlated I'm basically getting an 82%\ncorrelated I'm basically getting an 82%\ncorrelated I'm basically getting an 82% because of this entire equation so I\nbecause of this entire equation so I\nbecause of this entire equation so I hope you are understanding this this is\nhope you are understanding this this is\nhope you are understanding this this is very much important to understand a very\nvery much important to understand a very\nvery much important to understand a very very important property simple way to\nvery important property simple way

what\nremember in our previous session what all things we discussed linear\nall things we discussed linear\nall things we discussed linear regression and then we had discussed\nregression and then we had discussed\nregression and then we had discussed about the cost function we have\nabout the cost function we have\nabout the cost function we have discussed about R square adjusted\ndiscussed about R square adjusted\ndiscussed about R square adjusted adjusted R square sorry R square and\nadjusted R square sorry R square and\nadjusted R square sorry R square and adjusted R square we have

about it it was nothing but 1\ndiscussed about it it was nothing but 1\ndiscussed about it it was nothing but 1 by 2 m summation of I = 1 2 m h Theta of\nby 2 m summation of I = 1 2 m h Theta of\nby 2 m summation of I = 1 2 m h Theta of x i -\nx i -\nx i - y - y i s so this is the cost function\ny - y i s so this is the cost function\ny - y i s so this is the cost function that we had discussed right yesterday\nthat we had discussed right yesterday\nthat we had discussed right yesterday and this cost function was able to give\nand this cost function was able to give\nand this cost function was able to give us a\nus a\nus a gradient descent with respect to the J\ngradient descent with respect to the J\ngradient descent with respect to the J of\nof\nof theta J of theta Zer or Theta not so I\ntheta J of theta Zer or Theta not so I\ntheta J of theta Zer or Theta not so I can also write this as J of theta comma\ncan also write this as J of theta comma\ncan also write this as J of theta comma Theta 0 comma Theta 1 now let me give\nTheta 0 comma Theta 1 now let me give\nTheta 0 comma Theta 1 now let me give you a scenario let's say that I have a\nyou a scenario let's say that I have a\nyou a scenario let's say that I have a scenario over here and I have this\nscenario over here and I have this\nscenario over here and I have this specific scenario let's say that I just\nspecific scenario let's say that I just\nspecific scenario let's say that I just have two points which looks like this\nhave two points which looks like this\nhave two points which looks like this okay now if I have these two specific\nokay now if I have these two specific\nokay now if I have these two specific points what will happen I will probably\npoints what will happen I will probably\npoints what will happen I will probably try to create a best fit line the best\ntry to create a best fit line the best\ntry to create a best fit line the best fit line will definitely pass through\nfit line will definitely pass through\nfit line will definitely pass through all the points like this if I try to\nall the points like this if I try to\nall the points like this if I try to calculate the cost function what will be\ncalculate the cost function what will be\ncalculate the cost function what will be the value of J of theta 0 comma Theta 1\nthe value of J of theta 0 comma Theta 1\nthe value of J of theta 0 comma Theta 1 let's say that in this particular case\nlet's say that in this particular case\nlet's say that in this particular case since it is passing through the origin\nsince it is passing through the origin\nsince it is passing through the origin my Theta 0 will be zero okay so what\nmy Theta 0 will be zero okay so what\nmy Theta 0 will be zero okay so what will be the value of theta 0 comma Theta\nwill be the value of theta 0 comma Theta\nwill be the value of theta 0 comma Theta 1 so here obviously you can see that\n1 so here obviously you can see that\n1 so here obviously you can see that there is no difference so it will\nthere is no difference so it will\nthere is no difference so it will obviously become zero Now understand\nobviously become zero Now understand\nobviously become zero Now understand this data that you see right right this\nthis data that you see right right this\nthis data that you see right right this data is basically called as training\ndata is basically called as training\ndata is basically called as training data so this data that I have actually\ndata so this data that I have actually\ndata so this data that I have actually plotted with two points these are\nplotted with two points these are\nplotted with two points these are specifically called as training\nspecifically called as training\nspecifically called as training data now what is the problem in this\ndata now what is the problem in this\ndata now what is the problem in this data right now see right now exactly\ndata right now see right now exactly\ndata right now see right now exactly whatever line is basically getting\nwhatever line is basically getting\nwhatever line is basically getting created over here which is through the\ncreated over here which is through the\ncreated over here which is through the uh hypothesis over here you can see that\nuh hypothesis over here you can see that\nuh hypothesis over here you can see that it is passing through every point so\nit is passing through every point so\nit is passing through every point so that is the reason your cost is zero and\nthat is the reason your cost is zero and\nthat

to\nare here let's consider that I I want to\nare here let's consider that I I want to basically uh come up with this new data\nbasically uh come up with this new data\nbasically uh come up with this new data point now in this particular scenario if\npoint now in this particular scenario if\npoint now in this particular scenario if I want to predict with respect to this\nI want to predict with

is here\npoint is here is this the difference between the\nis this the difference between the\nis this the difference between the predicted and the real Point quite\npredicted and the real Point quite\npredicted and the real Point quite huge yes or no so this is basically\nhuge yes or no so this is basically\nhuge yes or no so this is basically creating a condition which is called as\ncreating a condition which is called as\ncreating a condition which is called as overfitting that basically means even\noverfitting that basically means even\noverfitting that basically means even though my\nthough my\nthough my model has given or trained well with the\nmodel has given or trained well with the\nmodel has given or trained well with the training\ntraining\ntraining data or let me write it down properly\ndata or let me write it down properly\ndata or let me write it down properly over here so this condition since since\nover here so this condition since since\nover here so this condition since since you can see that over here my each and\nyou can see that over here my each and\nyou can see that over here my each and every point is basically passing through\nevery point is basically passing through\nevery point is basically passing through the best fit line so because of that\nthe best fit line so because of that\nthe best fit line so because of that what happens it causes something called\nwhat happens it causes something called\nwhat happens it causes something called as\nas\nas overfitting so you really need to\noverfitting so you really need to\noverfitting so you really need to understand what is overfitting now what\nunderstand what is overfitting now what\nunderstand what is overfitting now what does overfitting mean overfitting\ndoes overfitting mean overfitting\ndoes overfitting mean overfitting basically means my model performs well\nbasically means my model performs well\nbasically means my model performs well with training data but it fails to\nwith training data but it fails to\nwith training data but it fails to perform well with test data now what is\nperform well with test data now what is\nperform well with test data now what is the test data over here the test data is\nthe test data over here the test data is\nthe test data over here the test data is basically this points the real test data\nbasically this points the real test data\nbasically this points the real test data answer was this points but because the\nanswer was this points but because the\nanswer was this points but because the my line is like this I'm actually\nmy line is like this I'm actually\nmy line is like this I'm actually getting the predicted point over here so\ngetting the predicted point over here so\ngetting the predicted point over here so this distance if I try to calculate it\nthis distance if I try to calculate it\nthis distance if I try to calculate it is quite huge so in this scenario\nis quite huge so in this scenario\nis quite huge so in this scenario whenever I say my model performs well\nwhenever I say my model performs well\nwhenever I say my model performs well with training data and it fails to\nwith training data and it fails to\nwith training data and it fails to perform well with test data then this\nperform well with test data then this\nperform well with test data then this scenario we say it as overfitting so\nscenario we say it as overfitting so\nscenario we say it as overfitting so this scenario when the model performs\nthis scenario when the model performs\nthis scenario when the model performs well with training data I have a\nwell with training data I have a\nwell with training data I have a condition which is called as low bias\ncondition which is called as low bias\ncondition which is called as low bias and when it fails to perform with the\nand when it fails to perform with the\nand when it fails to perform with the test data then it is basically called as\ntest data then it is basically called as\ntest data then it is basically called as high High variance very important okay I\nhigh High variance very important okay I\nhigh High variance very important okay I will make each and everyone understand\nwill make each and everyone understand\nwill make each and everyone understand one by one if it is performing well with\none by one if it is performing well with\none by one if it is performing well with the training data that is basically low\nthe training data that is basically low\nthe training data that is basically low bias and whenever it performs well with\nbias and whenever it performs well with\nbias and whenever it performs well with the test sorry fails to perform well\nthe test sorry fails to perform well\nthe test sorry fails to perform well with the fails to perform well with the\nwith the fails to perform well with the\nwith the fails to perform well with the test data then it is basically High\ntest data then it is basically High\ntest data then it is basically High variance now similarly I may have\nvariance now similarly I may have\nvariance now similarly I may have another scenario which is called as\nanother scenario which is called as\nanother scenario which is called as underfitting so let's say that I have\nunderfitting so let's say that I have\nunderfitting so let's say that I have something called as\nsomething called as\nsomething called as underfitting now in this underfitting\nunderfitting now in this underfitting\nunderfitting now in this underfitting what is the scenario the\nwhat is the scenario the\nwhat is the scenario the model fails to perform it gives bad\nmodel fails to perform it gives bad\nmodel fails to perform it gives bad accuracy I say that model always\naccuracy I say that model always\naccuracy I say that model always remember whenever I talk about bias then\nremember whenever I talk about bias then\nremember whenever I talk about bias then you can understand that it is something\nyou can understand that it is something\nyou can understand that it is something related to the training data whenever I\nrelated to the training data whenever I\nrelated to the training data whenever I talk about test data at that point of\ntalk about test data at that point of\ntalk about test data at that point of time you talk about variance and that\ntime you talk about variance and that\ntime you talk about variance and that specifically whenever you talk about\nspecifically whenever you talk about\nspecifically whenever you talk about variance that basically means we are\nvariance that basically means we are\nvariance that basically means we are talking about the test data so for an\ntalking about the test data so for an\ntalking about the test data so for an overfitting you will basically have low\noverfitting you will basically have low\noverfitting you will basically have low bias and high variance low bias with\nbias and high variance low bias with\nbias and high variance low bias with respect to the training data and high\nrespect to the training data and high\nrespect to the training data and high variance with respect to the test

training data and the model accuracy is\ntraining data and the model accuracy is\ntraining data and the model accuracy is also bad with test data in this scenario\nalso bad with test data in this scenario\nalso bad with test data in this scenario we basically say it as underfitting so\nwe basically say it as underfitting so\nwe basically say it as underfitting so these are the two conditions that are\nthese are the two conditions that are\nthese are the two conditions that are with respect to underfitting that\nwith respect to underfitting that\nwith respect to underfitting that basically means that both for the\nbasically means that both for the\nbasically means that both for the training data also the model is giving\ntraining data also the model is giving\ntraining data also the model is giving bad accuracy and again for the test data\nbad accuracy and again for the test data\nbad accuracy and again for the test data also it is basically having a bad\nalso it is basically having a bad\nalso it is basically having a bad accuracy so in this particular scenario\naccuracy so in this particular scenario\naccuracy so in this particular scenario we can definitely say two things out of\nwe can definitely say two things out of\nwe can definitely say two things out of underfitting one is high bias and high\nunderfitting one is high bias and high\nunderfitting one is high

consider that I'm\nokay let's consider that I'm initializing it to one let's say my\ninitializing it to one let's say my\ninitializing it to one let's say my Lambda value is 1 now what I will do is\nLambda value is 1 now what I will do is\nLambda value is 1 now what I will do is that this l Lambda value is 1 Let's\nthat this l Lambda value is 1 Let's\nthat this l Lambda value is 1 Let's consider our slope value initially is\nconsider our slope value initially is\nconsider our slope value initially is two and because of this two I got this\ntwo and because of this two I got this\ntwo and because of this two I got this best fit line I'm just going to consider\nbest fit line I'm just going to consider\nbest fit line I'm just going to consider it so if I do the total sum over here if\nit so if I do the total sum over here if\nit so if I do the total sum over here if I'm just considering this this value is\nI'm just considering this this value is\nI'm just considering this this

again\nvalue so what it will do it will again\nvalue so what it will do it will again change the Theta 1 value and let's say\nchange the Theta 1 value and let's say\nchange the Theta 1 value and let's say that my Theta van value has changed now\nthat my Theta van value has changed now\nthat my Theta van value has changed now it got another best fit line which looks\nit got another best fit line which looks\nit got another best fit line which looks something like like this this is my next\nsomething like like this this is my next\nsomething like like this this is my next best fit line I'll talk about Lambda\nbest fit line I'll talk about Lambda\nbest fit line I'll talk about Lambda Lambda is a hyper parameter guys what\nLambda is a hyper parameter guys what\nLambda is a hyper parameter guys what exactly is Lambda I'll just talk about\nexactly is Lambda I'll just talk about\nexactly is Lambda I'll just talk about it now when I basically change this line\nit now when I basically

changed my Theta 1 value\nconsider I have changed my Theta 1 value\nconsider I have changed my Theta 1 value since we need to minimize now when we\nsince we need to minimize now when we\nsince we need to minimize now when we need to minimize what it will do we'll\nneed to minimize what it will do we'll\nneed to minimize what it will do we'll again calculate the slope of this\nagain calculate the slope of this\nagain calculate the slope of this particular line and then we will try to\nparticular line and then we will try to\nparticular line and then we will try to create a new line when we sorry it is\ncreate a new line when we sorry it is\ncreate a new line when we sorry it is two two not three just a second guys 0 +\ntwo two not three just a second guys 0 +\ntwo two not three just a

definitely get a kind of\nline we will definitely get a kind of\nline we will definitely get a kind of small difference so now if I go ahead\nsmall difference so now if I go ahead\nsmall difference so now if I go ahead and consider the new equation my y hat I\nand consider the new equation my y hat I\nand consider the new equation my y hat I minus y\nminus y\nminus y i² + Lambda of slope squar this

because I have some difference and then plus again 1\nsome difference and then plus again 1\nsome difference and then plus again 1 multiplied by now understand whether the\nmultiplied by now understand whether the\nmultiplied by now understand whether the slope will increase in this particular\nslope will increase in this particular\nslope will increase in this particular case or whether it will decrease in this\ncase or whether it will decrease in this\ncase or whether it will decrease in this particular case there will be some slope\nparticular case there will be some slope\nparticular case there will be some slope value let's say that I have got some\nvalue let's say that I have got some\nvalue let's say that I have got some slope of this particular line in this\nslope of this particular line in this\nslope of this particular line in this particular scenario again your slope\nparticular scenario again your slope\nparticular scenario again your slope will definitely decrease so let's say in\nwill definitely decrease so let's say in\nwill definitely decrease so let's say in the case of two initially it was now it\nthe case of two initially it was now it\nthe case of two initially it was now it is basically\nis basically\nis basically 1.36 whole squ now this small Value\n1.36 whole squ now this small Value\n1.36 whole squ now this small Value Plus 1 + 1.3 squ or let me consider that\nPlus 1 + 1.3 squ or let me consider that\nPlus 1 + 1.3 squ or let me consider that my slope is now one simple value that is\nmy slope is now one simple value that is\nmy slope is now one simple value that is 5 so if I get this it is 2.25 2.25 plus\n5 so if I get this it is 2.25 2.25 plus\n5 so if I get this it is 2.25 2.25 plus small value it will be less than three\nsmall value it will be less than three\nsmall value it will be less than three only right it will obviously be less\nonly right it will obviously be less\nonly right it will obviously be less than three or equal to 3 but understand\nthan three or equal to 3 but understand\nthan three or equal to 3 but understand what is happening the value is getting\nwhat is happening the value is getting\nwhat is happening the value is getting reduced from 4 to 3 so this is is the\nreduced from 4 to 3 so this is is the\nreduced from 4 to 3 so this is is the importance of Ridge now what will happen\nimportance of Ridge now what will happen\nimportance of Ridge now what will happen is that you will try to get a\nis that you will try to get a\nis that you will try to get a generalized model

it may look something like this so here fail is nothing but\nlike this so here fail is nothing but\nlike this so here fail is nothing but zero pass is one the middle point is\nzero pass is one the middle point is\nzero pass is one the middle point is basically 0.5 so obviously with the help\nbasically 0.5 so obviously with the help\nbasically 0.5 so obviously with the help of linear\nof linear\nof linear regression I'm able to create this best\nregression I'm able to create this best\nregression I'm able to create this best fit line and I'll put a scenario that\nfit line and I'll put a scenario that\nfit line and I'll put a scenario that whenever the value is less\nwhenever the value is less\nwhenever the value is less than5 whenever the value is less than\nthan5 whenever the

point is this\nlet's say that new data point is this\nlet's say that new data point is this and based on this I'll try to do the\nand based on this I'll try to do the\nand based on this I'll try to do the prediction I'm actually able to get the\nprediction I'm actually able to get the\nprediction I'm actually able to get the output over here now when I'm getting\noutput over here now when I'm getting\noutput over here now when I'm getting the output over here this basically is\nthe output over here this basically is\nthe output over here this basically is 0.25 now in this particular scenario\n0.25 now in this particular scenario\n0.25 now in this particular scenario obviously I'm able to say that yes the\nobviously I'm able to say that yes the\nobviously I'm able to say that yes the person I'll write a condition over here\nperson I'll write a condition over here\nperson I'll write a condition over here saying that if my H Theta of x value is\nsaying that if my H Theta of x value is\nsaying that if my H Theta of x value is less than 0.5 then my output should be\nless than 0.5 then my output should be\nless than 0.5 then my output should be zero let's say less than 0.5 I'll say\nzero let's say less than 0.5 I'll say\nzero let's say less than 0.5 I'll say not less than or equal to less than5\nnot less than or equal to less than5\nnot less than or equal to less than5 then my output will be zero right so in\nthen my output will be zero right so in\nthen my output will be zero right so in this particular case Zero basically\nthis particular case Zero basically\nthis particular case Zero basically means fail similarly I'll have a\nmeans fail similarly I'll have a\nmeans fail similarly I'll have a scenario where I'll say that when if my\nscenario where I'll say that when if my\nscenario where I'll say that when if my S of theta of X is greater than or equal\nS of theta of X is greater than or equal\nS of theta of X is greater than or equal to 5 then this will basically be one\nto 5 then this will basically be one\nto 5 then this will basically be one which is nothing but pass so this two\nwhich is nothing but pass so this two\nwhich is nothing but pass so this two condition I can definitely write over\ncondition I can definitely write over\ncondition I can definitely write over here this is my center point so that any\nhere this is my center

let's say new data point is somewhere coming over here with this red\nsomewhere coming over here with this red\nsomewhere coming over here with this red point\npoint\npoint now what I'll do I'll basically draw a\nnow what I'll do I'll basically draw a\nnow what I'll do I'll basically draw a straight line it will come over here I\nstraight line it will come over here I\nstraight line it will

has passed obviously this is fine this is\npassed obviously this is fine this is\npassed obviously this is fine this is obviously working better this is\nobviously working better this is\nobviously working better this is obviously working better so what what is\nobviously working better so what what is\nobviously working better so what what is the problem why we are not using linear\nthe problem why we are not using linear\nthe problem why we are not using linear regression okay in order to solve this\nregression okay in order to solve this\nregression okay in order to solve this particular problem why you are\nparticular problem why you are\nparticular problem why you are specifically having logistic regression\nspecifically having logistic regression\nspecifically having logistic regression the answer is very much simple guys the\nthe answer is very much simple guys the\nthe answer is very much simple guys the answer is that whenever let's say that\nanswer is that whenever let's say that\nanswer is that whenever let's say that if I have an outlier which looks\nif I have an outlier which looks\nif I have an outlier which looks something like this suppose I have an\nsomething like this suppose I have an\nsomething like this suppose I have an outlier which comes like this over here\noutlier which comes like this over here\noutlier which comes like this over here what is this value let's say that this\nwhat is this value let's say that this\nwhat is this value let's say that this value is nothing but 7 8 9 10 let's say\nvalue is nothing but 7 8 9 10 let's say\nvalue is nothing but 7 8 9 10 let's say that the number of study hours and I'm\nthat the number of study hours and I'm\nthat the number of study hours and I'm studying for nine it is obviously pass\nstudying for nine it is obviously pass\nstudying for nine it is obviously pass now in this particular scenario when I\nnow in this particular scenario when I\nnow in this particular scenario when I have an outlier this entire line will\nhave an outlier this entire line will\nhave an outlier this entire line will change now I will probably get my line\nchange now I will probably get my line\nchange now I will probably get my line which looks something like this okay my\nwhich looks something like this okay my\nwhich looks something like this okay my line will basically move something like\nline will basically move something like\nline will basically move something like this it will now get moved something\nthis it will now get moved something\nthis it will now get moved something like this now when it gets moves\nlike this now when it gets moves\nlike this now when it gets moves completely like this now for even five\ncompletely like this now for even five\ncompletely like this now for even five or even at any point that I am actually\nor even at any point that I am actually\nor even at any point that I am actually predicting let's say that at this\npredicting let's say that at this\npredicting let's say that at this particular point if I try to find out\nparticular point if I try to find out\nparticular point if I try to find out it'll be showing less than 0. five so\nit'll be showing less than 0. five so\nit'll be showing less than 0. five so here this particular value or answer\nhere this particular value or answer\nhere this particular value or answer will be wrong right because if we are\nwill be wrong right because if we are\nwill be wrong right because if we are studying more than 5 hours OB viously B\nstudying more than 5 hours OB viously B\nstudying more than 5 hours OB viously B based on the previous line the person\nbased on the previous line the person\nbased on the previous line the person had to pass but in this scenario it is\nhad to pass but in this scenario it is\nhad to pass but in this scenario it is failing it is coming less than 0.5 but\nfailing it is coming less than 0.5 but\nfailing it is coming less than 0.5 but the real value for this is basically\nthe real value for this is basically\nthe real value for this is basically passed so I hope you are understanding\npassed so I hope you are understanding\npassed so I hope you are understanding because of the outlier the entire line\nbecause of the outlier the entire line\nbecause of the outlier the entire line is getting changed so how do we fix this\nis getting changed so how do we fix this\nis getting changed so how do we fix this particular problem now in this two\nparticular problem now in this two\nparticular problem now in this two scenarios are there first of all\nscenarios are there first of all\nscenarios are there first of all obviously because of just an outlier\nobviously because of just an outlier\nobviously because of just an outlier your entire line is getting shifted here\nyour entire line is getting shifted here\nyour entire line is getting shifted here and there the second point is that over\nand there the second point is that over\nand there the second point is that over here sometimes you're also getting\nhere sometimes you're also getting\nhere sometimes you're also getting greater than one you you're also getting\ngreater than one you you're also getting\ngreater than one you you're also getting less than one suppose if I try to\nless than one suppose if I try to\nless than one suppose if I try to calculate for this particular point if I\ncalculate for this particular point if I\ncalculate for this particular point if I project it in behind I'll be getting\nproject it in behind I'll be getting\nproject it in behind I'll be getting some negative value so we have to squash\nsome negative value so we have to squash\nsome negative value so we have to squash this function if I squash this function\nthis function if I squash this function\nthis function if I squash this function then it'll become a plain line right how\nthen it'll become a plain line right how\nthen it'll become a plain line right how do we squash it and for this we use\ndo we squash it and for this we use\ndo we squash it and for this we use something called as sigmoid activation\nsomething called as sigmoid activation\nsomething called as sigmoid activation function or sigmoid function if somebody\nfunction or sigmoid function if somebody\nfunction or sigmoid function if somebody ask you why don't you use linear\nask you why don't you use linear\nask you why don't you use linear regession in order to solve this\nregession in order to solve this\nregession in order to solve this classification problem then your answer\nclassification problem then your answer\nclassification problem then your answer should be very much simple you should\nshould be very much simple you should\nshould be very much simple you should say this to specific points so we will\nsay this to specific points so we will\nsay this to specific points so we will try to go ahead and solve some linear\ntry to go ahead and solve some linear\ntry to go ahead and solve some linear regression now with the help of cost\nregression now with the help of cost\nregression now with the help of cost function everything as such and we'll\nfunction everything as such and we'll\nfunction everything as such and we'll try to understand how the cost function\ntry to understand how the cost function\ntry to understand how the cost function will look for logistic regression second\nwill look for logistic regression second\nwill look for logistic regression second reason I told you right it is greater\nreason I told you right it is greater\nreason I told you right it is greater than zero over here the line is going\nthan zero over here the line is going\nthan zero over here the line is going greater than zero right greater than\ngreater than zero right greater than\ngreater than zero right greater than zero I have only Z and one and it is\nzero I have only Z and one and it is\nzero I have only Z and one and it is becoming greater than zero but I have\nbecoming greater than zero but I have\nbecoming greater than zero but I have already told that our maximum and\nalready told that our maximum and\nalready told that our maximum and minimum value are 1 and zero so I hope\nminimum value are 1 and zero so I hope\nminimum value are 1 and zero so I hope you have understood why linear Reg\nyou have understood why linear Reg\nyou have understood why linear Reg cannot be used okay I showed you all the\ncannot be used okay I showed you all the\ncannot be used okay I showed you all the scenarios why linear regression should\nscenarios why linear regression should\nscenarios why linear regression should not be used now we'll continue and\nnot be used now we'll continue and\nnot be used now we'll continue and probably discuss about the other things\nprobably discuss about the other things\nprobably discuss about the other things over here and uh we will now try to\nover here and uh we will now try to\nover here and uh we will now try to understand fine what exactly logistic\nunderstand fine what exactly logistic\nunderstand fine what exactly logistic regression is all about and how the\nregression is all about and how the\nregression is all about and how the decision boundaries basically created\ndecision boundaries basically created\ndecision boundaries basically created now we'll go ahead and discuss about\nnow we'll go ahead and discuss about\nnow we'll go ahead and discuss about that specific thing so let's go ahead\nthat specific thing so let's go ahead\nthat specific thing so let's go ahead our values should be always between 0 to\nour values should be always between 0 to\nour values should be always between 0 to one over here in this particular case\none over here in this particular case\none over here in this particular case because it is a binary classification\nbecause it is a binary classification\nbecause it is a binary classification problem only this should be the answer\nproblem only this should be the answer\nproblem only this should be the answer so let's go ahead and let's define our\nso let's go ahead and let's define our\nso let's go

but since we have to\nsaying okay but since we have to\nsaying okay but since we have to consider two things one is squashing the\nconsider two things one is squashing the\nconsider two things one is squashing the line okay how that squashing will\nline okay how that squashing will\nline okay how that squashing will basically happen see if I have this if I\nbasically happen see if I have this if

Theta 1 * X1 let's say now on\nTheta 0 + Theta 1 * X1 let's say now on\nTheta 0 + Theta 1 * X1 let's say now on top of this on top of this I have to\ntop of this on top of this I have to\ntop of this on top of this I have to apply something on top of this value I\napply something on top of this value I\napply something on top of this value I have to apply something so that I can\nhave to apply something so that I can\nhave to apply something so that I can make this line straight instead of just\nmake this line straight instead of just\nmake this line straight instead of just expanding in this way so my hypothesis\nexpanding in this way so my hypothesis\nexpanding in this way so my hypothesis will basically be now G of G is\nwill basically be now G of G is\nwill basically be now G of G is basically a function on Theta 0 and\nbasically a function on Theta 0 and\nbasically a function on Theta 0 and Theta 1 * X1 so here I'm trying to\nTheta 1 * X1 so here I'm trying to\nTheta 1 * X1 so here I'm trying to basically what I'm trying to do I will\nbasically what I'm trying to do I will\nbasically what I'm trying to do I will apply a mathematical formula on top of\napply a mathematical formula on top of\napply a mathematical formula on top of this linear regression to squash this\nthis linear regression to squash this\nthis linear regression to squash this line now let's go ahead and let's try to\nline now let's go ahead and let's try to\nline now let's go ahead and let's try to find out what is this G okay what is\nfind out what is this G okay what is\nfind out what is this G okay what is this G I will say let Z equal to Theta 0\nthis G I will say let Z equal to Theta 0\nthis G I will say let Z equal to Theta 0 + Theta 1 * X I'm just initializing this\n+ Theta 1 * X I'm

to understand what is this\nZ now we need to understand what is this\nZ now we need to understand what is this z g of Z and how do we basically specify\nz g of Z and how do we basically specify\nz g of Z and how do we basically specify what is the G function so my G function\nwhat is the G function so my G function\nwhat is the G function so my G function is nothing but H Theta of x equal to

obviously works\nmy hypothesis and this obviously works\nmy hypothesis and this obviously works well because it is being able to squash\nwell because it is being able to squash\nwell because it is being able to squash the function so this is basically my\nthe function so this is basically my\nthe function so this is basically my hypothesis which I am definitely trying\nhypothesis which I am definitely trying\nhypothesis which I am definitely trying to use it and this function that you are\nto use it and this function that you are\nto use it and this function that you are actually able to see is called as\nactually able to see is called as\nactually able to see is called as sigmoid or logistic function now you\nsigmoid or logistic function now you\nsigmoid or logistic function now you need to understand what does this\nneed to understand what does this\nneed to understand what does this sigmoid function look like in graph in\nsigmoid function look like in graph in\nsigmoid function look like in graph in graph it looks something like this so\ngraph it looks something like this so\ngraph it looks something like this so this this is my Zed value and this is my\nthis this is my Zed value and this is my\nthis this is my Zed value and this is my G of Z this is my 05 your sigmoid\nG of Z this is my 05 your sigmoid\nG of Z this is my 05 your sigmoid function will have this curve so

whenever your G of Z is greater\nthat is whenever your G of Z is greater\nthat is whenever your G of Z is greater than your G of Z is greater than or\nthan your G of Z is greater than or\nthan your G of Z is greater than or equal to 0.5 whenever your Zed is\nequal to 0.5 whenever your Zed is\nequal to 0.5 whenever your Zed is greater than or equal to Z so obviously\ngreater than or equal to Z so obviously\ngreater than or equal to Z so obviously whenever your Zed value is greater than\nwhenever your Zed value is greater than\nwhenever your Zed value is greater than Z it is greater than 0.5 if your Zed\nZ it is greater than 0.5 if your Zed\nZ it is greater than 0.5 if your Zed value is less than zero what it will\nvalue is less than zero what it will\nvalue is less than zero what it will become it will basically be less than\nbecome it will basically be less than\nbecome it will basically be less than 0.5 so you can write that specific\n0.5 so you can write that specific\n0.5 so you can write that specific condition also you want so this is the\ncondition also you want so this is the\ncondition also you want so this is the most important condition\nmost important condition\nmost

function now let's go ahead\nactivation function now let's go ahead and let's first of all Define our cost\nand let's first of all Define our cost\nand let's first of all Define our cost function because for this we definitely\nfunction because for this we definitely\nfunction because for this we definitely require our cost\nrequire our cost\nrequire our cost function now everything will be same\nfunction now everything will be same\nfunction now everything will be same obviously you know the cost function of\nobviously you know the cost function of\nobviously you know the cost function of linear regression because the first best\nlinear regression because the first best\nlinear regression because the first best fit line that you are probably creating\nfit line that you are probably creating\nfit line that you are probably creating is with the help of linear\nis with the help of linear\nis with the help of linear regression now in this particular case\nregression now in this particular case\nregression now in this particular case in the case of linear regression so here\nin the case of linear regression so here\nin the case of linear regression so here you can basically write J J of theta 1\nyou can basically write J J of theta 1\nyou can basically write J J of theta 1 is nothing but 1 by m summation of I = 1\nis nothing but 1 by m summation of I = 1\nis nothing but 1 by m summation of I = 1 2 m 1X 2 and here you have H Theta of x\n2 m 1X 2 and here you have H Theta of x\n2 m 1X 2 and here you have H Theta of x minus y of I I whole Square so this is\nminus y of I I whole Square so this is\nminus y of I I whole Square so this is your entire thing of if you remember\nyour entire thing of if you remember\nyour entire thing of if you remember linear regression whatever things we\nlinear regression whatever things we\nlinear regression whatever things we have discussed yesterday okay so this is\nhave discussed yesterday okay so this is\nhave discussed yesterday okay so this is the cost function let's consider that\nthe cost function let's consider that\nthe cost function let's consider that for linear regression for this is for\nfor linear

happen for\nlogistic regression what will happen for\nlogistic regression what will happen for your logistic regression I will take the\nyour logistic regression I will take the\nyour logistic

is s Theta of X it is nothing\nknow what is s Theta of X it is nothing but 1 + 1 + e ^ of minus Theta 0 + Theta\nbut 1 + 1 + e ^ of minus Theta 0 + Theta\nbut 1 + 1 + e ^ of minus Theta 0 + Theta sorry Theta 1 multiplied by X right this\nsorry Theta 1 multiplied by X right this\nsorry Theta 1 multiplied by X right this is my with respect to logistic\nis my with respect to logistic\nis my with respect to logistic regression this is my entire equation\nregression this is my entire equation\nregression this is my entire equation now similarly I will try to only put\nnow similarly I will try to only put\nnow similarly I will try to only put this H Theta of X let's consider that\nthis H Theta of X let's consider that\nthis H Theta of X let's consider that this is my cost function only only my H\nthis is my cost function only only my H\nthis is my cost function only only my H Theta of X is changing in this\nTheta of X is changing in this\nTheta of X is changing in this particular case so if I go ahead and\nparticular case so if I go ahead and\nparticular case so if I go ahead and write my cost function I can basically\nwrite my cost function I can basically\nwrite my cost function I can basically say 1x2 h Theta of X of i - y of\nsay 1x2 h Theta of X of i - y of\nsay 1x2 h Theta of X of i - y of i² and in this particular scenario what\ni² and in this particular scenario what\ni² and in this particular scenario what is h Theta of X it is nothing but 1 + 1\nis h Theta of X it is nothing but 1 + 1\nis h Theta of X it is nothing but 1 + 1 + e ^ minus Theta 1 x so this is what\n+ e ^ minus Theta 1 x so this is what\n+ e ^ minus Theta 1 x so this is what this is getting replaced and this is my\nthis is getting replaced and this is my\nthis is getting replaced and this is my logistic regression cost function I'm\nlogistic regression cost function I'm\nlogistic regression cost function I'm just considering this cost function part\njust considering this cost function

this diagram we have\nproblem you can see this diagram we have\nproblem you can see this diagram we have something called as logistic regression\nsomething called as logistic regression\nsomething called as logistic regression cost function so I can now write my\ncost function so I can now write my\ncost function so I can now write my logistic regression cost function in a\nlogistic regression cost function in a\nlogistic regression cost function in a different way so this researcher\ndifferent way so this researcher\ndifferent way so this researcher researcher thought of it and basically\nresearcher thought of it and basically\nresearcher thought of it and basically came up with this proposal that the\ncame up with this proposal that the\ncame up with this proposal that the logistic cost function should look\nlogistic cost function should look\nlogistic cost function should look something like this so the entire cost\nsomething like this so the entire cost\nsomething like this so the entire cost function of logistic regression that is\nfunction of logistic regression that is\nfunction of logistic regression that is specifically H Theta of X of I comma y\nspecifically H Theta of X of I comma y\nspecifically H Theta of X of I comma y this should be written something like\nthis should be written something like\nthis should be written something like this and it should be written like this\nthis and it should be written like this\nthis and it should be written like this see here I'm just going to write cost\nsee here I'm just going to write cost\nsee here I'm just going to write cost function of J of theta 1 let's say that\nfunction of J of theta 1 let's say that\nfunction of J of theta 1 let's say that I'm writing J of theta 1 okay so J of\nI'm writing J of theta 1 okay so J of\nI'm writing J of theta 1 okay so J of theta 1 what are the different different\ntheta 1 what are the different different\ntheta 1 what are the different different output that I'll be getting I'll be get\noutput that I'll be getting I'll be get\noutput that I'll be getting I'll be get I'll be getting yal 1 or y equal to 0 So\nI'll be getting yal 1 or y equal to 0 So\nI'll be getting yal 1 or y equal to 0 So based on this two scenarios our cost\nbased on this two scenarios our cost\nbased on this two scenarios our cost function will look something like this\nfunction will look something like this\nfunction will look something like this minus log of H of theta of X and I know\nminus log of H of theta of X and I know\nminus log of H of theta of X and I know I hope you all know what is h Theta of x\nI hope you all know what is h Theta of x\nI hope you all know what is h Theta of x h Theta of X is nothing but 1 + 1 ^ of -\nh Theta of X is nothing but 1 + 1 ^ of -\nh Theta of X is nothing but 1 + 1 ^ of - Theta 1 x so this is what is my H Theta\nTheta 1 x so this is what is my H Theta\nTheta 1 x so this is what is my H Theta of X and whenever Y is Zer then you\nof X and whenever Y is Zer then you\nof X and whenever Y is Zer then you basically have minus log * 1 - H Theta\nbasically have minus log * 1 - H Theta\nbasically have minus log * 1 - H Theta of X of I of I okay so this is how you\nof X of I of I okay so this is how you\nof X of I of I okay so this is how you basically write your cost function in\nbasically write your cost function in\nbasically write your cost function in this particular scenario now with the\nthis particular scenario now with the\nthis particular scenario now with the help of this cost function it is always\nhelp of this cost function it is always\nhelp of this cost function it is always possible since it is getting log log is\npossible since it is getting log log is\npossible since it is getting log log is basically getting used in this scenario\nbasically getting used in this scenario\nbasically getting used in this scenario you'll always get a global Minima that\nyou'll always get a global Minima that\nyou'll always get a global Minima that is the reason why they have completely\nis the reason why they have completely\nis the reason why they have completely neglected this cost function and utiliz\nneglected this cost function and utiliz\nneglected this cost function and utiliz this cost function now what does this\nthis cost function now what does this\nthis cost function now what does this cost function basically mean two\ncost function basically mean two\ncost function basically mean two scenarios if Y is equal to 1 Let's\nscenarios if Y is equal to 1 Let's\nscenarios if Y is equal to 1 Let's consider this is my cost function\nconsider this is my cost function\nconsider this is my cost function graph I have H Theta of X and you know\ngraph I have H Theta of X and you know\ngraph I have H Theta of X and you know that H Theta of x value will be ranging\nthat H Theta of x value will be ranging\nthat H Theta of x value will be ranging between 0 to 1 since it is a\nbetween 0 to 1 since it is a\nbetween 0 to 1 since it is a classification problem so it will be\nclassification problem so it will be\nclassification problem so it will be ranging between 0 to 1 and this is\nranging between 0 to 1 and this is\nranging between 0 to 1 and this is basically of J of theta 1 which is my\nbasically of J of theta 1 which is my\nbasically of J of theta 1 which is my cost function so if Y is equal to 1 this\ncost function so if Y is equal to 1 this\ncost function so if Y is equal to 1 this specific equation will be used and\nspecific equation will be used and\nspecific equation will be used and whenever this equation is is basically\nwhenever this equation is is basically\nwhenever this equation is is basically used you get a you get a curve see minus\nused you get a you get a curve see minus\nused you get a you get a curve see minus log s of X of I you get a curve which\nlog s of X of I you get a curve which\nlog s of X of I you get a curve which looks something like this okay which\nlooks something like this okay which\nlooks something like this okay which you'll get a curve which looks like this\nyou'll get a curve which looks like this\nyou'll get a curve which looks like this now what does this curve basically\nnow what does this curve basically\nnow what does this curve basically specify the curve come up with two\nspecify the curve come up with two\nspecify the curve come up with two assumptions the cost will be zero if Y\nassumptions the cost will be zero if Y\nassumptions the cost will be zero if Y is = 1 and H Theta of x equal to 1 that\nis = 1 and H Theta of x equal to 1 that\nis = 1 and H Theta of x equal to 1 that basically when your s Theta of X is 1\nbasically when your s Theta of X is 1\nbasically when your s Theta of X is 1 and the Y is output is one that\nand the Y is output is one that\nand the Y is output is one that basically means you're going to assign\nbasically means you're going to assign\nbasically means you're going to assign over here one right so in this\nover here one right so in this\nover here one right so in this particular case you will be seeing that\nparticular case you will be seeing that\nparticular case you will be seeing that your cost function will be zero cost is\nyour cost function will be zero cost is\nyour cost function will be zero cost is zero so here is my zero it is meeting\nzero so here is my zero it is meeting\nzero so here is my zero it is meeting over here if you of x equal to 1 and Y\nover here if you of x equal to 1 and Y\nover here if you of x equal to 1 and Y is equal to 1 so this is this is again a\nis equal to 1 so this is this is again a\nis equal to 1 so this is this is again a convex function only then the next point\nconvex function only then the next point\nconvex function only then the next point that you can probably discuss over here\nthat you can probably discuss over here\nthat you can probably discuss over here is with respect to Y is equal to 0 if\nis with respect to Y is equal to 0 if\nis with respect to Y is equal to 0 if your Y is Z then what kind of curve you\nyour Y is Z then what kind of curve you\nyour Y is Z then what kind of curve you will be getting you'll get a different\nwill be getting you'll get a different\nwill be getting you'll get a different kind of curve which will look like this\nkind of curve which will look like this\nkind of curve which will look like this H Theta of x here your value will be 0\nH Theta of x here your value will be 0\nH Theta of x here your value will be 0 to one and here you'll be having a curve\nto one and here you'll be having a curve\nto one and here you'll be having a curve which looks like this so when you\nwhich looks like this so when you\nwhich looks like this so when you combine this two you'll be able to see\ncombine this two you'll be able to see\ncombine this two you'll be able to see that you are able to get a kind of\nthat you are able to get a kind of\nthat you are able to get a kind of gradient descent so this will definitely\ngradient descent so this will definitely\ngradient descent so this will definitely help us to create a cost function so I\nhelp us to create a cost function so I\nhelp us to create a cost function so I hope everybody is able to understand\nhope everybody is able to understand\nhope everybody is able to understand till here with respect to this and this\ntill here with respect to this and this\ntill here with respect to this and this will definitely work so finally I can\nwill definitely work so finally I can\nwill definitely work so finally I can also write my cost function in a\nalso write my cost function in a\nalso write my cost function in a different way the cost function that I\ndifferent way the cost function that I\ndifferent way the cost function that I will probably write over here so this\nwill probably write over here so this\nwill probably write over here so this will be my J of theta 1\nwill be my J of theta 1\nwill be my J of theta 1 so I can come up with a cost function\nso I can come up with a cost function\nso I can come up with a cost function which looks like this\nwhich looks like this\nwhich looks like this cost of H of theta of X of I comma Yus\ncost of H of theta of X of I comma Yus\ncost of H of theta of X of I comma Yus log of H Theta of x if Y is equal\nlog of H Theta of x if Y is equal\nlog of H Theta of x if Y is equal 1 and then minus\n1 and then minus\n1 and then minus log 1 - H Theta of x if Y is equal\nlog 1 - H Theta of x if Y is equal\nlog 1 - H Theta of x if Y is equal 0 now I can combine this both and\n0 now I can combine this both and\n0 now I can combine this both and probably write something like like this\nprobably write something like like this\nprobably write something like like this I can combine this both and I can\nI can combine this both and I can\nI can combine this both and I can basically write cost of H Theta of X of\nbasically write cost of H Theta of X of\nbasically write cost of H Theta of X of IA Y is equal to - y log H Theta of X of\nIA Y is equal to - y log H Theta of X of\nIA Y is equal to - y log H Theta of X of I minus log 1 -\nI minus log 1 -\nI minus log 1 - y okay 1 - y log of 1 - H Theta of X so\ny okay 1 - y log of 1 - H Theta of X so\ny okay 1 - y log of 1 - H Theta of X so this will be my final cost\nthis will be my final cost\nthis will be my final cost function and here also you can see that\nfunction and here also you can see that\nfunction and here also you can see that if I\nif I\nif I replace if I replace y with one then\nreplace if I replace y with one then\nreplace if I replace y with one then what will remain only this particular\nwhat will remain only this particular\nwhat will remain only this particular value will remain right this value when\nvalue will remain right this value when\nvalue will remain right this value when Y is equal to 1 this thing only will\nY is equal to 1 this thing only will\nY is equal to 1 this thing only will come you see over here replace y with\ncome you see over here replace y with\ncome you see over here replace y with one probably replace y with one and then\none probably replace y with one and then\none probably replace y with one and then you'll be able to see so here I can now\nyou'll be able to see so here I can now\nyou'll be able to see so here I can now write if Y is equal to 1 my cost\nwrite if Y is equal to 1 my cost\nwrite if Y is equal to 1 my cost function will Rook something like this\nfunction will Rook something like this\nfunction will Rook something like this which is nothing\nwhich is nothing\nwhich is nothing but see Y is 1 then what will happen my\nbut see Y is 1 then what will happen my\nbut see Y is 1 then what will happen my log of H Theta of X of I will come and\nlog of H Theta of X of I will come and\nlog of H Theta of X of I will come and this 1 - 1 is 0 so 0 multili by anything\nthis 1 - 1 is 0 so 0 multili by anything\nthis 1 - 1 is 0 so 0 multili by anything will be 0 if Y is equal to 0 then what\nwill be 0 if Y is equal to 0 then what\nwill be 0 if Y is equal to

will\nwhen it is zero this will - y will become 0 0 multili by anything is z so\nbecome 0 0 multili by anything is z so\nbecome 0 0 multili by anything is z so here you'll be able to see that I am\nhere you'll be able to see that I am\nhere you'll be able to see that I am I'll be having minus log 1 - H Theta of\nI'll be having minus log 1 - H Theta of\nI'll be having minus log 1 - H Theta of x i so this both the condition has been\nx i so this both the condition has been\nx i so this both the condition has been proved by this cost function\nproved by this cost function\nproved by this cost function so this is my cost function yes cost\nso this is my cost function yes cost\nso this is my cost function yes cost function and loss function with respect\nfunction and loss function with

write\nalmost same so finally if I try to write\nalmost same so finally if I try to write J of theta because I have that 1X 2 m\nJ of theta because I have that 1X 2 m\nJ of theta because I have that 1X 2 m also right so 1X 2 m also I have so what\nalso right so 1X 2 m also I have so what\nalso right so 1X 2 m also I have so what I'm actually going to do here you will\nI'm actually going to do here you will\nI'm actually going to do here you will be able to see that I can write J of\nbe able to see that I can write J of\nbe able to see that I can write J of theta 1 is equal to 1 by 2 m summation\ntheta 1 is equal to 1 by 2 m summation\ntheta 1 is equal to 1 by 2 m summation of IAL 1 to M and then write down the\nof IAL 1 to M and then write down the\nof IAL 1 to M and then write down the entire equation that you have probably\nentire equation that you have probably\nentire equation that you have probably over here so here you have minus y or I\nover here so here you have

discuss about\nlikelihood if now I will discuss about performance metrics and this is specific\nperformance metrics and this is specific\nperformance metrics and this is specific to classification problem and binary\nto classification problem and binary\nto classification problem and binary classification I'm talking let's\nclassification I'm talking let's\nclassification I'm talking let's consider let's consider I have a data\nconsider let's consider I have a data\nconsider let's consider I have a data set which has X1 X2 and this is y and\nset which has X1 X2 and this is y and\nset which has X1 X2 and this is y and obviously in logistic uh classification\nobviously in logistic uh classification\nobviously in logistic uh classification you have outputs like 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 and\nyou have outputs like 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 and\nyou have outputs like 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 and your y hat y hat is basically the output\nyour y hat y hat is basically the output\nyour y hat y hat is basically the output of the predicted model now in this\nof the predicted model now in this\nof the predicted model now in this particular scenario my y hat will\nparticular scenario my y hat will\nparticular scenario my y hat will probably be 1 1 0 uh 1 1 1 Z so in this\nprobably be 1 1 0 uh 1 1 1 Z so in this\nprobably be 1 1 0 uh 1 1 1 Z so in this particular scenario this is my predicted\nparticular

come to some kind of conclusions\ncan we come to some kind of conclusions\ncan we come to some kind of conclusions wherein probably we will be able to\nwherein probably we will be able to\nwherein probably we will be able to identify what may be the accuracy of\nidentify what may be the accuracy of\nidentify what may be the accuracy of this specific model with respect to this\nthis specific model with respect to this\nthis specific model with respect to this many data points because confusion\nmany data points because confusion\nmany data points because confusion Matrix is all dealt with this is called\nMatrix is all dealt with this is called\nMatrix is all dealt with this is called as we will first of all have to create a\nas we will first of all have to create a\nas we will first of all have to create a confusion Matrix now for a binary\nconfusion Matrix now for a binary\nconfusion Matrix now for a binary classification problem the confusion\nclassification problem the confusion\nclassification problem the confusion Matrix will look like this so here you\nMatrix will look like this so here you\nMatrix will look like this so here you have 1 0 1 0 Let's say that this is\nhave 1 0 1 0 Let's say that this is\nhave 1 0 1 0 Let's say that this is prediction let's say that these are my\nprediction let's say that these are my\nprediction let's say that these are my actual value and these are my prediction\nactual value and these are my prediction\nactual value and these are my prediction value okay these both are prediction\nvalue okay these both are prediction\nvalue okay these both are prediction value these are my output value when my\nvalue these are my output value when my\nvalue these are my output value when my actual value is zero my predicted value\nactual value is zero my predicted value\nactual value is zero my predicted value is one does this what does this mean\nis one does this what does this mean\nis one does this what does this mean wrong prediction right so when my actual\nwrong prediction right so when my actual\nwrong prediction right so when my actual value is zero my predicted value is 1 so\nvalue is zero my predicted value is 1 so\nvalue is zero my predicted value is 1 so here my count will increase to one let's\nhere my count will increase to one let's\nhere my count will increase to one let's go to the second scenario when the\ngo to the second scenario when the\ngo to the second scenario when the actual value is one and my predicted\nactual value is one and my predicted\nactual value is one and my predicted value is one that basically means one\nvalue is one that basically means one\nvalue is one that basically means one and one so here I'm going to increase my\nand one so here I'm going to increase my\nand one so here I'm going to increase my count similarly when my actual value is\ncount similarly when my actual value is\ncount similarly when my actual value is zero my predicted value is zero so that\nzero my predicted value is zero so that\nzero my predicted value is zero so that basically mean when my actual value is z\nbasically mean when my actual value is z\nbasically mean when my actual value is z my predicted value is zero I'm going to\nmy predicted value is zero I'm going to\nmy predicted value is zero I'm going to increase the count by one if I go over\nincrease the count by one if I go over\nincrease the count by one if I go over here 1 one again it is so instead of\nhere 1 one again it is so instead of\nhere 1 one again it is so instead of writing one now this will become two I'm\nwriting one now this will become two I'm\nwriting one now this will become two I'm going to increase the count similarly\ngoing to increase the count similarly\ngoing to increase the count similarly I'll go over here one more one is there\nI'll go over here one more one is there\nI'll go over here one more one is there so I'm going to increase the count three\nso I'm going to increase the count three\nso I'm going to increase the count three then I have 01 01 basically means when\nthen I have 01 01 basically means when\nthen I have 01 01 basically means when my actual value is zero I'm actually\nmy actual value is zero I'm actually\nmy actual value is zero I'm actually getting it as one so I'm also going to\ngetting it as one so I'm also going to\ngetting it as one so I'm also going to increase this particular value as two\nincrease this particular value as two\nincrease this particular value as two and then finally I have 1 and zero where\nand then finally I have 1 and zero where\nand then finally I have 1 and zero where I'm going to increase like this now what\nI'm going to increase like this now what\nI'm going to increase like this now what does this basically mean now what does\ndoes this basically mean now what does\ndoes this basically mean now what does this basically mean see with respect to\nthis basically mean see with respect to\nthis basically mean see with respect to this kind of predictions whenever we are\nthis kind of predictions whenever we are\nthis kind of predictions whenever we are discussing this basically basically says\ndiscussing this basically basically says\ndiscussing this basically basically says so this is my actual values and I have Z\nso this is my actual values and I have Z\nso this is my actual values and I have Z 1 and zero and this is my predicted\n1 and zero and this is my predicted\n1 and zero and this is my predicted values I also have 1 and zero this value\nvalues I also have 1 and zero this

when\ncalled as true positive this value when\ncalled as true positive this value when 0 and Zer are there this is called as\n0 and Zer are there this is called as\n0 and Zer are there this is called as false negative whenever your actual\nfalse negative whenever your actual\nfalse negative whenever your actual value is zero and you have predicted one\nvalue is zero and you have predicted one\nvalue is zero and you have predicted one this becomes false positive and whenever\nthis becomes false positive and whenever\nthis becomes false positive and whenever your actual value is one you have\nyour actual value is one you have\nyour actual value is one you have predicted zero this becomes false\npredicted zero this becomes false\npredicted zero this becomes false negative now coming to this I really\nnegative now coming to this I really\nnegative now coming to this I really need to find out the accuracy of this\nneed to find out the accuracy of this\nneed to find out the accuracy of this model now if I really want to find out\nmodel now if I really want to find out\nmodel now if I really want to find out and this is what is called as confusion\nand this is what is called as

the accuracy the\nreally want to find out the accuracy the\nreally want to find out the accuracy the accuracy of this model it is very much\naccuracy of this model it is very much\naccuracy of this model it is very much simple this middle elements that you are\nsimple this middle elements that you are\nsimple this middle elements that you are able to see will basically give us the\nable to see will basically give us the\nable to see will basically give us the right output so this and this if I add\nright output so this and this if I add\nright output so this and this if I add it up it will give us the right output\nit up it will give us the right output\nit up it will give us the right output so here I'm going to get TP + TN divided\nso here I'm going to get TP + TN divided\nso here I'm going to get TP + TN divided by TP + FP + FN + TN so once I calculate\nby TP + FP + FN + TN so once I calculate\nby TP + FP + FN + TN so once I calculate this so I have 3 + 1\nthis so I have 3 + 1\nthis so I have 3 + 1 / 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 so this is nothing but 4\n/ 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 so this is nothing but 4\n/ 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 so this is nothing but 4 by 7 what is 4 by\nby 7 what is 4 by\nby 7 what is 4 by 757 so am I getting 57 percentage\n757 so am I getting 57 percentage\n757 so am I getting 57 percentage accuracy so I'm actually getting 57%\naccuracy so I'm actually getting 57%\naccuracy so I'm actually getting 57% accuracy over here with respect to the\naccuracy over here with respect to the\naccuracy over here with respect to the accuracy so this is how we basically\naccuracy so this is

in our data\ntopics what one is suppose in our data set I have zeros and one category let's\nset I have zeros and one category let's\nset I have zeros and one category let's say in my output if I say Zer are 900\nsay in my output if I say Zer are 900\nsay in my output if I say Zer are 900 and ones are 100 this becomes an\nand ones are 100 this becomes an\nand ones are 100 this becomes an imbalanced data very clear right so this\nimbalanced data very clear right so this\nimbalanced data very clear right so this become an imbalanced data set it is a\nbecome an imbalanced data set it is a\nbecome an imbalanced data set it is a biased data suppose if I say zeros are\nbiased data suppose if I say zeros are\nbiased data suppose if I say zeros are probab\nprobab\nprobab 600 and ones are probably 400 in this\n600 and ones are probably 400 in this\n600 and ones are probably 400 in this particular scenario I will say that this\nparticular scenario I will say that this\nparticular scenario I will say that this is the balance data because yes you have\nis the balance data because yes you have\nis the balance data because yes you have 100 less but it's okay the it may not\n100 less but it's okay the it may not\n100 less but it's okay the it may not impact many of the algorithm now see\nimpact many of the algorithm now see\nimpact many of the algorithm now see guys most of the algorithm that we will\nguys most of the algorithm that we will\nguys most of the algorithm that we will be probably discussing imbalanced if we\nbe probably discussing imbalanced if we\nbe probably discussing imbalanced if we have an imbalanced data set it will\nhave an imbalanced data set it will\nhave an imbalanced data set it will obviously affect the algorithms let me\nobviously affect the algorithms let me\nobviously affect the algorithms let me talk about this let's say that I have\ntalk about this let's say that I have\ntalk about this let's say that I have number of zeros as 900 and number of\nnumber of zeros as 900 and number of\nnumber of zeros as 900 and number of ones is 100 now let's say that my model\nones is 100 now let's say that my model\nones is 100 now let's say that my model I have created which will directly\nI have created which will directly\nI have created which will directly predict\npredict\npredict zero it'll I'll just say that all my\nzero it'll I'll just say that all my\nzero it'll I'll just say that all my inputs that it is probably getting with\ninputs that it is probably getting with\ninputs that it is probably getting with respect to this training data it'll just\nrespect to this training data it'll just\nrespect to this training data it'll just output zero now in this particular\noutput zero now in this particular\noutput zero now in this particular scenario what will be my accuracy my\nscenario what will be my accuracy my\nscenario what will be my accuracy my accuracy will be 900 divid by 1,000\naccuracy will be 900 divid by 1,000\naccuracy will be 900 divid by 1,000 right so this is nothing but 90% so is\nright so this is nothing but 90% so is\nright so this is nothing but 90% so is this a good\nthis a good\nthis a good accuracy obviously it is a good accuracy\naccuracy obviously it is a good accuracy\naccuracy obviously it is a good accuracy but this is a biased data if my model is\nbut this is a biased data if my model is\nbut this is a biased data if my model is basically just outputting 00000000 0 if\nbasically just outputting 00000000 0 if\nbasically just outputting 00000000 0 if it is outputting 00 00 0 obviously most\nit is outputting 00 00 0 obviously most\nit is outputting 00 00 0 obviously most of the answer will be zeros but this\nof the answer will be zeros but this\nof the answer will be zeros but this will be a scenario like you know where\nwill be a scenario like you know where\nwill be a scenario like you know where it is just outputting one thing then\nit is just outputting one thing then\nit is just outputting one thing then also it is able to get 90% accuracy so\nalso it is able to get 90% accuracy so\nalso it is able to get 90% accuracy so you should only not be dependent on\nyou should only not be dependent on\nyou should only not be dependent on accuracy so there are lot of\naccuracy so there are lot of\naccuracy so there are lot of terminologies that we will basically use\nterminologies that we will basically use\nterminologies that we will basically use one terminology that we specifically use\none terminology that we specifically use\none terminology that we specifically use is something called as Precision then\nis something called as Precision then\nis something called as Precision then we'll also use recall what is precision\nwe'll also use recall what is precision\nwe'll also use recall what is precision what is recall I'll write the formula\nwhat is recall I'll write the formula\nwhat is recall I'll write the formula over here in Precision what do we need\nover here in Precision what do we need\nover here in Precision what do we need to focus and then finally we will\nto focus and then finally we will\nto focus and then finally we will discuss about f score so we have to use\ndiscuss about f score so we have to use\ndiscuss about f score so we have to use different kind of parametrics of sorry\ndifferent kind of parametrics of sorry\ndifferent kind of parametrics of sorry different kind of formulas whenever you\ndifferent kind of formulas whenever you\ndifferent kind of formulas whenever you have an imbalanced data set you can also\nhave an imbalanced data set you can also\nhave an imbalanced data set you can also do oversampling but again understand in\ndo oversampling but again understand in\ndo oversampling but again understand in most of the scenarios in some of the\nmost of the scenarios in some of the\nmost of the scenarios in some of the scenarios oversampling may work but we\nscenarios oversampling may work but we\nscenarios oversampling may work but we have to focus on the type of performance\nhave to focus on the type of performance\nhave to focus on the type of performance metrics that we are focusing on right\nmetrics that we are focusing on right\nmetrics that we are focusing on right now I'll not say F1 score I'll say F\nnow I'll not say F1 score I'll say F\nnow I'll not say F1 score I'll say F score the reason why I'm saying I'll\nscore the reason why I'm saying I'll\nscore the reason why I'm saying I'll just let you know so let's talk about\njust let you know so let's talk about\njust let you know so let's talk about recall recall formula is basically given\nrecall recall formula is basically given\nrecall recall formula is basically given by true positive divided by true\nby true positive divided by true\nby true positive divided by true positive plus false negative\npositive plus false negative\npositive plus false negative Precision is given

positive and then I will probably\npositive and then I will probably\npositive and then I will probably discuss about F sore also or we\ndiscuss about F sore also or we\ndiscuss about F sore also or we basically say fbaa also now I'll just\nbasically say fbaa also now I'll just\nbasically say fbaa also now I'll just draw this confusion Matrix again okay\ndraw this confusion Matrix again okay\ndraw this confusion Matrix again okay which is having true positive true\nwhich is having true positive true\nwhich is having true positive true negative so let me draw it over here so\nnegative so let me draw it over here so\nnegative so let me draw it over here so this is my ones and zeros these are my\nthis is my ones and zeros these are my\nthis is my ones and zeros these are my actual

now in this particular scenario\nnegative now in this particular scenario when I'm actually discussing understand\nwhen I'm actually discussing understand\nwhen I'm actually discussing understand what is recall and what focus it is\nwhat is recall and what focus it is\nwhat is recall and what focus it is basically given on so here whenever I\nbasically given on so here whenever I\nbasically given on so here whenever I talk about recall recall basically says\ntalk about recall recall basically says\ntalk about recall recall basically says that TP TP divided by TP plus FN so I'm\nthat TP TP divided by TP plus FN so I'm\nthat TP TP divided by TP plus FN so I'm actually focusing on this so what does\nactually focusing on this so what does\nactually focusing on this so what does this basically say true uh recall out of\nthis basically say true uh recall out of\nthis basically say true uh recall out of all the actual true positives how many\nall the actual true positives how many\nall the actual true positives how many have been predicted correctly that is\nhave been predicted correctly that is\nhave been predicted correctly that is basically mentioned by TP out of all the\nbasically mentioned by TP out of all the\nbasically mentioned by TP out of all the positive values how many of them have\npositive values how many of them have\npositive values how many of them have predicted as positive so this is what it\npredicted as positive so this is what it\npredicted as positive so this is what it is basically saying and this scenario is\nis basically saying and this scenario is\nis basically saying and this scenario is called as recall in this the false\ncalled as recall in this the false\ncalled as recall in this the false negative is basically given more\nnegative is basically given more\nnegative is basically given more priority and our focus should be that we\npriority and our focus should be that we\npriority and our focus should be that we should try to reduce false positive\nshould try to reduce false positive\nshould try to reduce false positive false negative sorry we should try to\nfalse negative sorry we should try to\nfalse negative sorry we should try to reduce this now let's go ahead and let's\nreduce this now let's go ahead and let's\nreduce this now let's go ahead and let's discuss about Precision in Precision\ndiscuss about Precision in Precision\ndiscuss about Precision in Precision what we are doing we are basically\nwhat we are doing we are basically\nwhat we are doing we are basically taking out of all the predicted values\ntaking out of all the predicted values\ntaking out of all the predicted values out of all the predicted positive values\nout of all the predicted positive values\nout of all the predicted positive values how many of them are actual true or\nhow many of them are actual true or\nhow many of them are actual true or positive okay this is what Precision\npositive okay this is what Precision\npositive okay this is what Precision basically means now suppose if I\nbasically means now suppose if I\nbasically means now suppose if I consider spam classification suppose\nconsider spam classification suppose\nconsider spam classification suppose this is my task tell me in this\nthis is my task tell me in this\nthis is my task tell me in this particular case should we use Precision\nparticular case should we use Precision\nparticular case should we use Precision or recall and one more use case I'm\nor recall and one more use case I'm\nor recall and one more use case I'm saying that whether the person has\nsaying that whether the person has\nsaying that whether the person has cancer or not in which case we have to\ncancer or not in which case we have to\ncancer or not in which case we have to support recall and in which case we have\nsupport recall and in which case we have\nsupport recall and in which case we have to go ahead with Precision has cancer or\nto go ahead with Precision has cancer or\nto go ahead with Precision has cancer or not in spam what is important okay guys\nnot in spam what is important okay guys\nnot in spam what is important okay guys the recall is also called as true\nthe recall is also called as true\nthe recall is also called as true positive rate I can also say recall as\npositive rate I can also say recall as\npositive rate I can also say recall as sensitivity so if I go with Spam\nsensitivity so if I go with Spam\nsensitivity so if I go with Spam classification it should definitely go\nclassification it should definitely go\nclassification it should definitely go with Precision why it should go with\nwith Precision why it should go with\nwith Precision why it should go with Precision if I probably get a Spam ma\nPrecision if I probably get a Spam ma\nPrecision if I probably get a Spam ma the main aim should be that whenever I\nthe main aim should be that whenever I\nthe main aim should be that whenever I get a Spam Mill it should be identified\nget a Spam Mill it should be identified\nget a Spam Mill it should be identified as spam okay in that specific scenario\nas spam okay in that specific scenario\nas spam okay in that specific scenario my positive false positive we should try\nmy positive false positive we should try\nmy positive false positive we should try to reduce and in this scenario my false\nto reduce and in this scenario my false\nto reduce and in this scenario my false pository talks about the spam\npository talks about the spam\npository talks about the spam classification a lot in a better way in\nclassification a lot in a better way in\nclassification a lot in a better way in the case of cancer I should definitely\nthe case of cancer I should definitely\nthe case of cancer I should definitely use recall let's let's focus on the\nuse recall let's let's focus on the\nuse recall let's let's focus on the recall formula tp/ by TP plus FN if a\nrecall formula tp/ by TP plus FN if a\nrecall formula tp/ by TP plus FN if a person has a cancer see one actually he\nperson has a cancer see one actually he\nperson has a cancer see one actually he has a cancer it should be predicted as\nhas a cancer it should be predicted as\nhas a cancer it should be predicted as one otherwise if we have FN it is\none otherwise if we have FN it is\none otherwise if we have FN it is basically predicting it does not have a\nbasically predicting it does not have a\nbasically predicting it does not have a cancer that is really a big situation in\ncancer that is really a big situation in\ncancer that is really a big situation in this case if a person does not have a\nthis case if a person does not have a\nthis case if a person does not have a Cancer and if he's predict if the model\nCancer and if he's predict if the model\nCancer and if he's predict if the model predicts okay fine he has a cancer he\npredicts okay fine he has a cancer he\npredicts okay fine he has a cancer he may go and further do the test and then\nmay go and further do the test and then\nmay go and further do the test and then he'll come to know whether he has a\nhe'll come to know whether he has a\nhe'll come to know whether he has a cancer or not but this scenario is very\ncancer or not but this scenario is very\ncancer or not but this scenario is very dangerous if a person has a cancer but\ndangerous if a person has a cancer but\ndangerous if a person has a cancer but he is being indicated that he does not\nhe is being indicated that he does

scenarios at that\nconsider for both the scenarios at that\nconsider for both the scenarios at that point of time I will definitely use\npoint of time I will definitely use\npoint of time I will definitely use something called as F score F score or\nsomething called as F score F score or\nsomething called as F score F score or I'll also say it as F beta now how is\nI'll also say it as F beta now how is\nI'll also say it as F beta now how is fbaa Formula given as I will talk about\nfbaa Formula given as I will talk about\nfbaa Formula given as I will talk about it and here in the F score you have\nit and here in the F score you have\nit and here in the F score you have three different formulas the first\nthree different formulas the first\nthree different formulas the first Formula I will say basically as when\nFormula I will say basically as when\nFormula I will say basically as when your beta value is 1 okay first of all\nyour beta value is 1 okay first of all\nyour beta value is 1 okay first of all I'll just give a generic definition of f\nI'll just give a generic definition of f\nI'll just give a generic definition of f s or F beta here you are basically going\ns or F beta here you are basically going\ns or F beta here you are basically going to consider 1 + beta squ Precision\nto consider 1 + beta squ Precision\nto consider 1 + beta squ Precision multiplied by recall divided beta Square\nmultiplied by recall divided beta Square\nmultiplied by recall divided beta Square * Precision plus recall whenever your\n* Precision plus recall whenever your\n* Precision plus recall whenever your both false positive and false negative\nboth false positive and false negative\nboth false positive and false negative are important we select beta as one so\nare important we select beta as one so\nare important we select beta as one so if I select beta as 1 it becomes 1 + 4\nif I select beta as 1 it becomes 1 + 4\nif I select beta as 1 it becomes 1 + 4 Precision multiplied by recall then you\nPrecision multiplied by recall then you\nPrecision multiplied by recall then you have Precision plus recall so here sorry\nhave Precision plus recall so here sorry\nhave Precision plus recall so here sorry 1 + 1 so this becomes 2 multiplied by\n1 + 1 so this becomes 2 multiplied by\n1 + 1 so this becomes 2 multiplied by Precision into recall divided by\nPrecision into recall divided by\nPrecision into recall divided by Precision plus recall so here you have\nPrecision plus recall so here you have\nPrecision plus recall so here you have this is basically called as harmonic\nthis is basically called as harmonic\nthis is basically called as harmonic mean harmonic mean probably you have\nmean harmonic mean probably you have\nmean harmonic mean probably you have seen this kind of equation where you\nseen this kind of equation where you\nseen this kind of equation where you have written 2x y / x + y same type you\nhave written 2x y / x + y same type you\nhave written 2x y / x + y same type you are able to see this this is called as\nare able to see this this is called as\nare able to see this this is called as harmonic mean here the focus is on both\nharmonic mean here the focus is on both\nharmonic mean here the focus is on both false positive and false negative let's\nfalse positive and false negative let's\nfalse positive and false negative let's say that your false positive is more\nsay that your false positive is more\nsay that your false positive is more important than false negative at that\nimportant than false negative at that\nimportant than false negative at that point of time you will try to decrease\npoint of time you will try to decrease\npoint of time you will try to decrease or you will try to decrease your beta\nor you will try to decrease your beta\nor you will try to decrease your beta value let's say that I'm decreasing my\nvalue let's say that I'm decreasing my\nvalue let's say that I'm decreasing my Beta value to 0.5 then what will happen\nBeta value to 0.5 then what will happen\nBeta value to 0.5 then what will happen 1 +5 whole\n1 +5 whole\n1 +5 whole s and then you have P * R Precision\ns and then you have P * R Precision\ns and then you have P * R Precision recall and here also you have 25 p + r\nrecall and here also you have 25 p + r\nrecall and here also you have 25 p + r now in this particular scenario I'm\nnow in this particular scenario I'm\nnow in this particular scenario I'm decreasing my Beta decreasing the beta\ndecreasing my Beta decreasing the beta\ndecreasing my Beta decreasing the beta basically means that you are providing\nbasically means that you are providing\nbasically means that you are providing more importance to false positive than\nmore importance to false positive than\nmore importance to false positive than false negative and finally you'll be\nfalse negative and finally you'll be\nfalse negative and finally you'll be able to see that if I consider beta\nable to see that if I consider beta\nable to see that if I consider beta value as let me just say my notes if I\nvalue as let me just say my notes if I\nvalue as let me just say my notes if I consider beta value as two that\nconsider beta value as two that\nconsider beta value as two that basically means you are giving more\nbasically means you are giving more\nbasically means you are giving more importance to false negative than false\nimportance to false negative than false\nimportance to false negative than false positive so with this specific case you\npositive so with this specific case you\npositive so with this specific case you can come up to a conclusion what value\ncan come up to a conclusion what value\ncan come up to a conclusion what value you basically want to use now whenever I\nyou basically want to use now whenever I\nyou basically want to use now whenever I use beta is equal to 1 it becomes fub1\nuse beta is equal to 1 it becomes fub1\nuse beta is equal to 1 it becomes fub1 score if I use beta as .5 then this\nscore if I use beta as .5 then this\nscore if I use beta as .5 then this basically becomes f.5 score and this\nbasically becomes f.5 score and this\nbasically becomes f.5 score and this becomes your F2 score So based on which\nbecomes your F2 score So based on which\nbecomes your F2 score So based on which is important okay which is important\nis important okay which is important\nis important okay which is important whether your Precision or false positive\nwhether your Precision or false positive\nwhether your Precision or false positive or false negative is important you can\nor false negative is important you can\nor false negative is important you can consider those things F score will have\nconsider those things F score will have\nconsider those things F score will have different values if you're using beta is\ndifferent values if you're using beta is\ndifferent values if you're using beta is equal to 1 that basically means you are\nequal to 1 that basically means you are\nequal to 1 that basically means you are giving importance to both precision and\ngiving importance to both precision and\ngiving importance to both precision and recall if your false positive is more\nrecall if your false positive is more\nrecall if your false positive is more important then at that point of time you\nimportant then at that point of time you\nimportant then at that point of time you reduce beta value if false negative is\nreduce beta value if false negative is\nreduce beta value if false negative is greater than false bet uh false positive\ngreater than false bet uh false positive\ngreater than false bet uh false positive then your beta value is\nthen your beta value is\nthen your beta value is increasing beta is a deciding parameter\nincreasing beta is a deciding parameter\nincreasing beta is a deciding parameter to decide your F1 score or F2 score or F\nto decide your F1 score or F2 score or F\nto decide your F1 score or F2 score or F Point score now first thing first what\nPoint score now first thing first what\nPoint score now first thing first what is the agenda of today's session

to\nto solve linear regression I have to\nto solve linear regression I have to divide my independent and dependent\ndivide my independent and dependent\ndivide my independent and dependent features properly now let's go to the\nfeatures properly now let's go to the\nfeatures properly now let's go to the next step that\nnext step that\nnext step that is\nis\nis dividing the data\ndividing the

go to the first algorithm that is called as linear regression\nis called as linear regression\nis called as linear regression always remember whenever I definitely\nalways remember whenever I definitely\nalways remember whenever I definitely start with linear regression I'll\nstart with linear regression I'll\nstart with linear regression I'll definitely not go directly with linear\ndefinitely not go directly with linear\ndefinitely not go directly with linear regression instead what I will do is\nregression instead what I will do is\nregression instead what I will do is that I'll try to go with Ridge\nthat I'll try to go with Ridge\nthat I'll try to go with Ridge regression and uh lasso regression\nregression and uh lasso regression\nregression and uh lasso regression because there you are lot of options\nbecause there you are lot of options\nbecause there you are lot of options with respect to hyper pment T but I'll\nwith respect to hyper pment T but I'll\nwith respect to hyper pment T but I'll just show you how linear regression is\njust show you how linear regression is\njust show you how linear regression is done so basically you really really need\ndone so basically you really really need\ndone so basically you really really need to use a lot of libraries okay over here\nto use a lot of libraries okay over here\nto use a lot of libraries okay over here and based on this libraries this\nand based on this libraries this\nand based on this libraries this libraries will try to install okay and\nlibraries will try to install okay and\nlibraries will try to install okay and what are these libraries these are\nwhat are these libraries these are\nwhat are these libraries these are basically the linear regression Library\nbasically the linear regression Library\nbasically the linear regression Library so here I'm basically going to use two\nso here I'm basically going to use two\nso here I'm basically going to use two specific thing one is linear regression\nspecific thing one is linear regression\nspecific thing one is linear regression Library so I will just use from SK learn\nLibrary so I will just use from SK learn\nLibrary so I will just use from SK learn do linear uncore model import linear\ndo linear uncore model import linear\ndo linear uncore model import linear regression do you need to remember this\nregression do you need to remember this\nregression do you need to remember this the answer is no because I also do the\nthe answer is no because I also do the\nthe answer is no because I also do the Google and I try to find out where in\nGoogle and I try to find out where in\nGoogle and I try to find out where in escal and it is present okay so here is\nescal and it is present okay so here is\nescal and it is present okay so here is my linear regression so I will try to\nmy linear regression so I will try to\nmy linear regression so I will try to initialize linear reg is equal to\ninitialize linear reg is equal to\ninitialize linear reg is equal to initialize with linear regression and\ninitialize with linear regression and\ninitialize with linear regression and then here what I'm actually going to do\nthen here what I'm actually going to do\nthen here what I'm actually going to do I'm going to basically apply something\nI'm going to basically apply something\nI'm going to basically apply something called as cross validation cross\ncalled as cross validation cross\ncalled as cross validation cross validation is very much important\nvalidation is very much important\nvalidation is very much important because in Cross validation we divide\nbecause in Cross validation we divide\nbecause in Cross validation we divide out train and test data in such a

I have\nit is only 37.1 3 okay so this I have\nit is only 37.1 3 okay so this I have actually shown you how to do cross\nactually shown you how to do cross\nactually shown you how to do cross validation see with respect to linear\nvalidation see with respect to linear\nvalidation see with respect to linear regression you can't modify much with\nregression you can't modify much with\nregression you can't modify much with the parameter so that is the reason why\nthe parameter so that is the reason why\nthe parameter so that is the reason why specifically in order to overcome\nspecifically in order to overcome\nspecifically in order to overcome overfitting and do the feature selection\noverfitting and do the feature selection\noverfitting and do the feature

now because I I want to\nregression right now because I I want to show how hyperparameter tuning is done\nshow how hyperparameter tuning is done\nshow how hyperparameter tuning is done in R regression so for R regression the\nin R regression so for R regression the\nin R regression so for R regression the simple thing is that I'll be using two\nsimple thing is that I'll be using two\nsimple thing is that I'll be using two different libraries from skarn do\ndifferent libraries from skarn do\ndifferent libraries from skarn do linear linear uncore model I'm going to\nlinear linear uncore model I'm going to\nlinear linear uncore model I'm going to import Ridge so for the ridge it is also\nimport Ridge so for the ridge it is also\nimport Ridge so for the ridge it is also present in linear underscore model for\npresent in linear underscore model for\npresent in linear underscore model for doing the hyperparameter tuning I will\ndoing the hyperparameter tuning I will\ndoing the

between MSE and\nthat uh difference between MSE and negative MSE not big thing guys if you\nnegative MSE not big thing guys if you\nnegative MSE not big thing guys if you use MSE here mean squ error you'll be\nuse MSE here mean squ error you'll be\nuse MSE here mean squ error you'll be getting 37 I've just used negation of\ngetting 37 I've just used negation of\ngetting 37 I've just used negation of MSE it's okay anything is fine you can\nMSE it's okay anything is fine you can\nMSE it's okay anything is fine you can go with MSE also means square error\ngo with MSE also means square error\ngo with MSE also means square error there is also another uh another scoring\nthere is also another uh another scoring\nthere is also another uh another scoring area which is like which focuses on\narea which is like which focuses on\narea which is like which focuses on square root square mean Square uh sorry\nsquare root square mean Square uh sorry\nsquare root square mean Square uh sorry root means Square eror okay so there are\nroot means Square eror okay so there are\nroot means Square eror okay so there are different different things which you can\ndifferent different things which you

for\nalgorithm which is specifically used for classification and this specifically\nclassification and this specifically\nclassification and this specifically works on something called as base\nworks on something called as base\nworks on something called as base theorem now what exactly is base theorem\ntheorem now what exactly is base theorem\ntheorem now what exactly is base theorem first of all we need to understand about\nfirst of all we need to understand about\nfirst of all we need to understand about base theorem let's say that guys I have\nbase theorem let's say that guys I have\nbase theorem let's say that guys I have base theorem let's say that I have an\nbase theorem let's say that I have an\nbase theorem let's say that I have an experiment which is called as rolling a\nexperiment which is called as rolling a\nexperiment which is called as rolling a dis now in rolling a dis how many number\ndis now in rolling a dis how many number\ndis now in rolling a dis how many number of elements I have have so if I say what\nof elements I have have so if I say what\nof elements I have have so if I say what is the probability of 1 then obviously\nis the probability of 1 then obviously\nis the probability of 1 then obviously you'll be saying 1X 6 if I say\nyou'll be saying 1X 6 if I say\nyou'll be saying 1X 6 if I say probability of two then also here you'll\nprobability of two then also here you'll\nprobability of two then also here you'll say 1X 6 if I say probability of three\nsay 1X 6 if I say probability of three\nsay 1X 6 if I say probability of three then I will definitely say it is 1x 6 so\nthen I will definitely say it is 1x 6 so\nthen I will definitely say it is 1x 6 so here you know that this kind of events\nhere you know that this kind of events\nhere you know that this kind of events are basically called as independent\nare basically called as independent\nare basically called as independent events now rolling a dice why it is\nevents now rolling a dice why it is\nevents now rolling a dice why it is called as an independent event because\ncalled as an independent event because\ncalled as an independent event because getting one or two in every experiment\ngetting one or two in every experiment\ngetting one or two in every experiment one is not dependent on two two is not\none is not dependent on two two is not\none is not dependent on two two is not dependent on three so they are all\ndependent on three so they are all\ndependent on three so they are all independent that is the reason why we\nindependent that is the reason why we\nindependent that is the reason why we specifically say is an independent event\nspecifically say is an independent event\nspecifically say is an independent event but if I take an example of dependent\nbut if I take an example of dependent\nbut if I take an example of dependent events let's consider that I have a bag\nevents let's consider that I have a bag\nevents let's consider that I have a bag of marbles okay in this marble I\nof marbles okay in this marble I\nof marbles okay in this marble I basically have three red marbles and I\nbasically have three red marbles and I\nbasically have three red marbles and I have two green marbles now tell me what\nhave two green marbles now tell me what\nhave two green marbles now tell me what is the probability of suppose I have a\nis the probability of suppose I have a\nis the probability of suppose I have a event in the first event I take out a\nevent in the first event I take out a\nevent in the first event I take out a red marble so what is the probability of\nred marble so what is the probability of\nred marble so what is the probability of taking out a red marble so here you can\ntaking out a red marble so here you can\ntaking out a red marble so here you can definitely say that it is\ndefinitely say that it is\ndefinitely say that it is 3x5 okay so this is my first event now\n3x5 okay so this is my first event now\n3x5 okay so this is my first event now in the second event let's say that in\nin the second event let's say that in\nin the second event let's say that in this you have taken out the red marble\nthis you have taken out the red marble\nthis you have taken out the red marble now what is the second second time again\nnow what is the second second time again\nnow what is the second second time again you are taking out the second red marble\nyou are taking out the second red marble\nyou are taking out the second red marble or forget about second Rand marble now\nor forget about second Rand marble now\nor forget about second Rand marble now you want to take out the green marble\nyou want to take out the green marble\nyou want to take out the green marble now what is the probability with respect\nnow what is the probability with respect\nnow what is the probability with respect to taking out a green marble so here\nto taking out a green marble so here\nto taking out a green marble so here you'll be definitely saying that okay\nyou'll be definitely saying that okay\nyou'll be definitely saying that okay one red marble has been removed then the\none red marble has been removed then the\none red marble has been removed then the total number of marbles that are left\ntotal number of marbles that are left\ntotal number of marbles that are left are four so here you can definitely\nare four so here you can definitely\nare four so here you can definitely write that probability of getting a\nwrite that probability of getting a\nwrite that probability of getting a green marble is nothing but 2x4 which is\ngreen marble is nothing but 2x4 which is\ngreen marble is nothing but 2x4 which is nothing but 1x2 so here what is\nnothing but 1x2 so here what is\nnothing but 1x2 so here what is happening first first element you took\nhappening first first element you took\nhappening first first element you took out first marble that you took out first\nout first marble that you took out first\nout first marble that you took out first event from from the first event you took\nevent from from the first event you took\nevent from from the first event you took out red marble from the second event you\nout red marble from the second event you\nout red marble from the second event you took out green marble this two are in\ntook out green marble this two are in\ntook out green marble this two are in these two are dependent events because\nthese two are dependent events because\nthese two are dependent events because the number of marbles are getting\nthe number of marbles are getting\nthe number of marbles are getting reduced as you take out from them so if\nreduced as you take out from them so if\nreduced as you take out from them so if I tell you what is the probability of\nI tell you what is the probability of\nI tell you what is the probability of taking out a red marble and then a green\ntaking out a red marble and then a green\ntaking out a red marble and then a green marble so it's the simple the formula\nmarble so it's the simple the formula\nmarble so it's the simple the formula will be very much simple right which we\nwill be very much simple right which we\nwill be very much simple right which we have already discussed in stats it is\nhave already discussed in stats it is\nhave already discussed in

Outlook my day outlook temperature humidity wind are\noutlook temperature humidity wind are\noutlook temperature humidity wind are the input features independent feature\nthe input features independent feature\nthe input features independent feature this is my output feature this one that\nthis is my output feature this one that\nthis is my output feature this one that you are probably seeing play tennis is\nyou are probably seeing play tennis is\nyou are probably seeing play tennis is my output feature which is specifically\nmy output feature which is specifically\nmy output feature which is specifically a binary\na binary\na binary classification so what I'm actually\nclassification so what I'm actually\nclassification so what I'm actually going to do I'm basically going to take\ngoing to do I'm basically going to take\ngoing to do I'm basically going to take my Outlook feature and based on this\nmy Outlook feature and based on this\nmy Outlook feature and based on this Outlook feature I will just try to\nOutlook feature I will just try to\nOutlook feature I will just try to create a smaller table which will give\ncreate a smaller table which will give\ncreate a smaller table which will give some information now based on Outlook\nsome information now based on Outlook\nsome information now based on Outlook first of all try to find out how many\nfirst of all try to find out how many\nfirst of all try to find out how many categories are there in Outlook one is\ncategories are there in Outlook one is\ncategories are there in Outlook one is sunny one is\nsunny one is\nsunny one is overcast and one is rain right three\novercast and one is rain right three\novercast and one is rain right three categories are there so I'm going to\ncategories are there so I'm going to\ncategories are there so I'm going to write it down over here Sunny overcast\nwrite it down over here Sunny overcast\nwrite it down over here Sunny overcast and rain so these three are my features\nand rain so these three are my features\nand rain so these three are my features with respect to Sunny uh with Outlook I\nwith respect to Sunny uh with Outlook I\nwith respect to Sunny uh with Outlook I have three categories one is sunny one\nhave three categories one is sunny one\nhave three categories one is sunny one is overcast and one is RA here I'm going\nis overcast and one is RA here I'm going\nis overcast and one is RA here I'm going to basically say with respect to Sunny\nto basically say with respect to Sunny\nto basically say with respect to Sunny how many yes are there and how many no\nhow many yes are there and how many no\nhow many yes are there and how many no are there and what is the probability of\nare there and what is the probability of\nare there and what is the probability of yes and probability of no so I'm going\nyes and probability of no so I'm going\nyes and probability of no so I'm going to again write it over here so this is\nto again write it over here so this is\nto again write it over here so this is my Outlook feature\nmy Outlook feature\nmy Outlook feature and then I have categories first yes no\nand then I have categories first yes no\nand then I have categories first yes no Sunny overcast rain yes no then\nSunny overcast rain yes no then\nSunny overcast rain yes no then probability of yes and probability of no\nprobability of yes and probability of no\nprobability of yes and probability of no now the next thing that we need to find\nnow the next thing that we need to find\nnow the next thing that we need to find out is that with respect to Sunny how\nout is that with respect to Sunny how\nout is that with respect to Sunny how many of them are yes see yes we have so\nmany of them are yes see yes we have so\nmany of them are yes see yes we have so when we have sunny over here the answer\nwhen we have sunny over here the answer\nwhen we have sunny over here the answer is no so I will increase the count over\nis no so I will increase the count over\nis no so I will increase the count over here one then again I have sunny again\nhere one then again I have sunny again\nhere one then again I have sunny again answer is no so I'm going to increase\nanswer is no so I'm going to increase\nanswer is no so I'm going to increase the count to two with this sunny this is\nthe count to two with this sunny this is\nthe count to two with this sunny this is basically no okay so again I'm going to\nbasically no okay so again I'm going to\nbasically no okay so again I'm going to increase the count to three now with\nincrease the count to three now with\nincrease the count to three now with sunny how many of them are yes one and\nsunny how many of them are yes one and\nsunny how many of them are yes one and two so I have this one and this one so I\ntwo so I have this one and this one so I\ntwo so I have this one and this one so I have two so I'm going to say with\nhave two so I'm going to say with\nhave two so I'm going to say with respect to Sunny I have two\nrespect to Sunny I have two\nrespect to Sunny I have two yes understand Outlook is my X1 X1\nyes understand Outlook is my X1

we calculate we\nthis is the distance we calculate we\nthis is the distance we calculate we don't calculate the hypothenuse distance\ndon't calculate the hypothenuse distance\ndon't calculate the hypothenuse distance so this is the basic difference between\nso this is the basic difference between\nso this is the basic difference between ukan and magetan distance now you may be\nukan and magetan distance now you may be\nukan and magetan distance now you may be thinking Chris then fine that is for\nthinking Chris then fine that is for\nthinking Chris then fine that is for classification problem for regression\nclassification problem for regression\nclassification problem for regression what do we do for regression also it is\nwhat do we do for regression also it is\nwhat do we do for regression also it is very much simple suppose I have all the\nvery much simple suppose I have all the\nvery much simple suppose I have all the data points which looks like this now\ndata points which looks like this now\ndata points which looks like this now for a new data point like this if I want\nfor a new data point like this if I want\nfor a new data point like this if I want to calculate then we basically take up\nto calculate then we basically take up\nto calculate then we basically take up the nearest Five Points let's say my K\nthe nearest Five Points let's say my K\nthe nearest Five Points let's say my K is five k is a hyper parameter which we\nis five k is a hyper parameter which we\nis five k is a hyper parameter which we play now suppose let's say that K it\nplay now suppose let's say that K it\nplay now suppose let's say that K it finds the nearest point over here here\nfinds the nearest point over here here\nfinds the nearest point over here here here here and here so if we need to find\nhere here and here so if we need to find\nhere here and here so if we need to find out the point for this particular output\nout the point for this particular output\nout the point for this particular output with respect to the K is equal to 5 it\nwith respect to the K is equal to 5 it\nwith respect to the K is equal to 5 it will try to calculate the average of all\nwill try to calculate the average of all\nwill try to calculate the average of all the points once it calculates the\nthe points once it calculates the\nthe points once it calculates the average of all the points that becomes\naverage of all the points that becomes\naverage of all the points that becomes your output so regression and\nyour output so regression and\nyour output so regression and classification that is the only\nclassification that is the only\nclassification that is the only difference because this K is actually an\ndifference because this K is actually an\ndifference because this K is actually an hyper parameter we try with K is equal\nhyper parameter we try with K is equal\nhyper parameter we try with K is equal to 1 to 50 and then we probably try to\nto 1 to 50 and then we probably try to\nto 1 to 50 and then we probably try to check the error rate and if the error\ncheck the error rate and if the error\ncheck the error rate and if the error rate is less then only we select the\nrate is less then only we select the\nrate is less then only we select the model now two more things with respect\nmodel now two more things with respect\nmodel now two more things with respect to K nearish neighbor K nearest neighbor\nto K nearish neighbor K nearest neighbor\nto K nearish neighbor K nearest neighbor works very bad with respect to two\nworks very bad with respect to two\nworks very bad with respect to two things one is outliers and and one is\nthings one is outliers and and one is\nthings one is outliers and and one is imbalanced data set now if I have an\nimbalanced data set now if I have an\nimbalanced data set now if I have an outlier let's say I have an outlier over\noutlier let's say I have an outlier over\noutlier let's say I have an outlier over here this is one of my categories like\nhere this is one of my categories like\nhere this is one of my categories like this and this is my another category\nthis and this is my another category\nthis and this is my another category let's consider that I have some outliers\nlet's consider that I have some outliers\nlet's consider that I have some outliers which looks like this now if I'm trying\nwhich looks like this now if I'm trying\nwhich looks like this now if I'm trying to find out the point for this you can\nto find out the point for this you can\nto find out the point for this you can see that the nearest point is basically\nsee that the nearest point is basically\nsee that the nearest point is basically blue only and it belongs to the blue\nblue only and it belongs to the blue\nblue only and it belongs to the blue category but because this outlier you\ncategory but because this outlier you\ncategory but because this outlier you know it'll consider that the nearest\nknow it'll consider that the nearest\nknow it'll consider that the nearest neighbor is this so then this will be\nneighbor is this so then this will be\nneighbor is this so then this will

consider\nthis age else I'm just going to consider\nthis age else I'm just going to consider print retire so here is my ifls\nprint retire so here is my ifls\nprint retire so here is my ifls condition over here now whenever we have\ncondition over here now whenever we have\ncondition over here now whenever we have this kind of nested if Els condition\nthis kind of nested if Els condition\nthis kind of nested if Els condition what we can do is that we can also\nwhat we can do is that we can also\nwhat we can do is that we can also represent this in the form of decision\nrepresent this in the form of decision\nrepresent this in the form of decision trees we'll also we can actually form\ntrees we'll also we can actually form\ntrees we'll also we can actually form this in the form of decision and the\nthis in the form of decision and the\nthis in the form of decision and the decision tree here first of all we will\ndecision tree here first of all we will\ndecision tree here first of all we will have a specific root node let's say this\nhave a specific root node let's say this\nhave a specific root node let's say this is my root node now in this root node\nis my root node now in this root node\nis my root node now in this root node the first condition is less than or\nthe first condition is less than or\nthe first condition is less than or equal to 18 so here obviously I will be\nequal to 18 so here obviously I will be\nequal to 18 so here obviously I will be having two conditions saying that if it\nhaving two conditions saying that if it\nhaving two conditions saying that if it is less than or equal to 18 and one\nis less than or equal to 18 and one\nis less than or equal to 18 and one condition will be yes one condition will\ncondition will be yes one condition will\ncondition will be yes one condition will be no so if this is yes and if this is\nbe no so if this is yes and if this is\nbe no so if this is yes and if this is no right if this condition is true that\nno right if this condition is true that\nno right if this condition is true that basically means we'll go in this side if\nbasically means we'll go in this side if\nbasically means we'll go in this side if it is true then here we will basically\nit is true then here we will basically\nit is true then here we will basically have something like college so this is\nhave something like college so this is\nhave something like college so this is your Leaf node similarly when I have no\nyour Leaf node similarly when I have no\nyour Leaf node similarly when I have no okay no no in this particular case we\nokay no no in this particular case we\nokay no no in this particular case we will go to the next condition in this\nwill go to the next condition in this\nwill go to the next condition in this next condition I will again create a\nnext condition I will again create a\nnext condition I will again create a node and I'll say that okay this is less\nnode and I'll say that okay this is less\nnode and I'll say that okay this is less than 18 and greater than sorry less than\nthan 18 and greater than sorry less than\nthan 18 and greater than sorry less than or equal to 35 so if this is also there\nor equal to 35 so if this is also there\nor equal to 35 so if this is also there then again I'll have two conditions\nthen again I'll have two conditions\nthen again I'll have two conditions which is basically yes or no now when I\nwhich is basically yes or no now when I\nwhich is basically yes or no now when I create this yes or no over here you'll\ncreate this yes or no over here you'll\ncreate this yes or no over here you'll be able to see that basically means here\nbe able to see that basically means here\nbe able to see that basically means here again two condition will be there if it\nagain two condition will be there if it\nagain two condition will be there if it is yes I will say print work so this\nis yes I will say print work so this\nis yes I will say print work so this will again be my leaf\nwill again be my leaf\nwill again be my leaf node and again for no again I will do\nnode and again for no again I will do\nnode and again for no again I will do the further splitting which is retire so\nthe further splitting which is retire so\nthe further splitting which is retire so here you can see that this entire\nhere you can see that this entire\nhere you can see that this entire algorithm this entire code that I have\nalgorithm this entire code that I have\nalgorithm this entire code that I have actually written you can see that it has\nactually written you can see that it has\nactually written you can see that it has got converted to this kind of\ngot converted to this kind of\ngot converted to this kind of trees where you specifically able to\ntrees where you specifically able to\ntrees where you specifically able to take decisions yes or no so can we solve\ntake decisions yes or no so can we solve\ntake decisions yes or no so can we solve a classification\na classification\na classification problem sorry this is greater than 18\nproblem sorry this is greater than 18\nproblem sorry this is greater than 18 again if it is greater than 18 and less\nagain if it is greater than 18 and less\nagain if it is greater than 18 and less than or 35 so can we solve a\nthan or 35 so can we solve a\nthan or 35 so can we solve

called as pure\nand this node is called as pure\nand this node is called as pure node understand this why it is called as\nnode understand this why it is called as\nnode understand this why it is called as pure node because either you have all\npure node because either you have all\npure node because either you have all Yes or zeros NOS or zero yes or all NOS\nYes or zeros NOS or zero yes or all NOS\nYes or zeros NOS or zero yes or all NOS like that in this particular case I have\nlike that in this particular case I have\nlike that in this particular case I have all yes so if I take this

so from here I will probably not\nfurther so from here I will probably not\nfurther so from here I will probably not split I will definitely not split more\nsplit I will definitely not split more\nsplit I will definitely not split more because I don't require it because I\nbecause I don't require it because I\nbecause I don't require it because I have it is a pure leaf node okay you can\nhave it is a pure leaf node okay you can\nhave it is a pure leaf node okay you can also say that this is a pure leaf node\nalso say that this is a pure leaf node\nalso say that this is a pure

to find out the probability of\nyou want to find out the probability of\nyou want to find out the probability of yes out of this see when I say plus that\nyes out of this see when I say plus that\nyes out of this see when I say plus that basically means yes when I say minus\nbasically means yes when I say minus\nbasically means yes when I say minus that basically means no so what is the\nthat basically means no so what is the\nthat basically means no so what is the probability of yes so it is be nothing\nprobability of yes so it is be nothing\nprobability of yes so it is be nothing but yes plus and minus are specifically\nbut yes plus and minus are specifically\nbut yes plus and minus are specifically for binary\nfor binary\nfor binary class this can be positive negative so\nclass this

here log to the base 2 p+ p+ is again\nhere log to the base 2 p+ p+ is again\nhere log to the base 2 p+ p+ is again 3x3 so then again we have minus and this\n3x3 so then again we have minus and this\n3x3 so then again we have minus and this is now P minus what is p minus 0 by 3\nis now P minus what is p minus 0 by 3\nis now P minus what is p minus 0 by 3 log base 2 0 by 3 this obviously will\nlog base 2 0 by 3 this obviously will\nlog base 2 0 by 3 this obviously will become zero this will obviously become 0\nbecome zero this will obviously become 0\nbecome zero this will obviously become 0 because 0 divid by anything is zero what\nbecause 0 divid by anything is zero what\nbecause 0 divid by anything is zero what will this be 1 log to the base 1 what is\nwill this be 1 log to the base 1 what is\nwill this be 1 log to the base 1 what is this this is nothing but zero log to the\nthis this is nothing but zero log to the\nthis this is nothing but zero log to the base 1 is nothing but zero tell me\nbase 1 is nothing but zero tell me\nbase 1 is nothing but zero tell me whether this is a pure split or impure\nwhether this is a pure split or impure\nwhether this is a pure

answer of the\nwe have a pure split the answer of the entropy is going to come to zero so here\nentropy is going to come to zero so here\nentropy is going to come to zero so here I'm going to Define one graph\nI'm going to Define one graph\nI'm going to Define one graph this is H of s and let's say this is p+\nthis is H of s and let's say this is p+\nthis is H of s and let's say this is p+ or P minus if my probability of plus see\nor P minus if my probability of plus see\nor P minus if my probability of plus see when I say probability of plus is 0.5\nwhen I say probability of plus is 0.5\nwhen I say probability of plus is 0.5 what will be probability of minus it\nwhat will be probability of minus it\nwhat will be probability of minus it will also be 0. five right because it's\nwill also be 0. five right because it's\nwill also be 0. five right because it's just like P is equal to 1 - Q right if p\njust like P is equal to 1 - Q right if p\njust like P is equal to 1 - Q right if p is .5 then Q will be 1 - P same thing\nis .5 then Q will be 1 - P same thing\nis .5 then Q will be 1 - P same thing right so when it\nright so when it\nright so when it is5 obviously my h of s will be 1 let's\nis5 obviously my h of s will be 1 let's\nis5 obviously my h of s will be 1 let's say so this is this is the graph that\nsay so this is this is the graph that\nsay so this is this is the graph that will basically get formed let's go ahead\nwill basically get formed let's go ahead\nwill basically get formed let's go ahead and try to calculate the entropy of this\nand try to calculate the entropy of this\nand try to calculate the entropy of this guys what will be the entropy of this\nguys what will be the entropy of this\nguys what will be the entropy of this node so here I'm going to just make a\nnode so here I'm going to just make a\nnode so here I'm going to just make a graph h of s minus what is p+ p+ is\ngraph h of s minus what is p+ p+ is\ngraph h of s minus what is p+ p+ is nothing but 3x 6 log base 2 3x 6\nnothing but 3x 6 log base 2 3x 6\nnothing but 3x 6 log base 2 3x 6 minus three no are there 3x 6 log base 2\nminus three no are there 3x 6 log base 2\nminus three no are there 3x 6 log base 2 3x 6 so if you compute this\n3x 6 so if you compute this\n3x 6 so if you compute this log base 2 to the^ of 1 if you do the\nlog base 2 to the^ of 1 if you do the\nlog base 2 to the^ of 1 if you do the calculation here I'm actually going to\ncalculation here I'm actually going to\ncalculation here I'm actually going to get one so when I'm getting one when I'm\nget one so when I'm getting one when I'm\nget one so when I'm getting one when I'm actually getting one when you have three\nactually getting one when you have three\nactually getting one when you have three yes and three NOS what is the\nyes and three NOS what is the\nyes and three NOS what is the probability it is 50/50% right so when\nprobability it is 50/50% right so when\nprobability it is 50/50% right so when your p+ is5 that basically means your h\nyour p+ is5 that basically means your h\nyour p+ is5 that basically means your h of s is coming as one so from this graph\nof s is coming as one so from this graph\nof s is coming as one so from this graph you can see that I'm getting one if this\nyou can see that I'm getting one if this\nyou can see that I'm getting one if this is zero this is one this is zero and\nis zero this is one this is zero and\nis zero this is one this is zero and this is one I hope everybody is able to\nthis is one I hope everybody is able to\nthis is one I hope everybody is able to to understand guys 0o and one if your p+\nto understand guys 0o and one if your p+\nto understand guys 0o and one if your p+ is\nis\nis zero or if your p+ is one that basically\nzero or if your p+ is one that basically\nzero or if your p+ is one that basically means it becomes a pure split so in h of\nmeans it becomes a pure split so in h of\nmeans it becomes a pure split so in h of s you are going to get\ns you are going to get\ns you are going to get zero so always understand your entropy\nzero so always understand your entropy\nzero so always understand your entropy will be between 0 to\nwill be between 0 to\nwill be between 0 to 1 if I have a impure this is a\n1 if I have a impure this is a\n1 if I have a impure this is a completely impure split because here you\ncompletely impure split because here you\ncompletely impure split because here you have 50% probability of getting yes 50%\nhave 50% probability of getting yes 50%\nhave 50% probability of getting yes 50% probability of getting no h ofs is\nprobability of getting no h ofs is\nprobability of getting no h ofs is entropy this is entropy for the sample H\nentropy this is entropy for the sample H\nentropy this is entropy for the sample H ofs notation that I'm using is H ofs so\nofs notation that I'm using is H ofs so\nofs notation that I'm using is H ofs so if whenever the split is happening the\nif whenever the split is happening the\nif whenever the split is happening the first thing is done the purity test the\nfirst thing is done the purity test the\nfirst thing is done the purity test the purity test is done with the help of\npurity test is done with the help of\npurity test is done with the help of entropy right now I'll also show guinea\nentropy right now I'll also show guinea\nentropy right now I'll also show guinea guinea impurity don't worry so with the\nguinea impurity don't worry so with the\nguinea impurity don't worry so with the entropy you'll be able to find if I am\nentropy you'll be able to find if I am\nentropy you'll be able to find if I am getting one that basically means it is a\ngetting one that basically means it is a\ngetting one that basically means it is a impure split and if I'm getting zero it\nimpure split and if I'm getting zero it\nimpure split and if I'm getting zero it is pure split so this is the graph okay\nis pure split so this is the graph okay\nis pure split so this is the graph okay this is the graph and this graph is\nthis is the graph and this graph is\nthis is the graph and this graph is basically the entropy graph again\nbasically the entropy graph again\nbasically the entropy graph again understand if your probability of\nunderstand if your probability of\nunderstand if your probability of getting yes or no is 0.5 that basically\ngetting yes or no is 0.5 that basically\ngetting yes or no is 0.5 that basically means 50/50 is there 3s and three NOS\nmeans 50/50 is there 3s and three NOS\nmeans 50/50 is there 3s and three NOS then your entropy is going to be 1 h of\nthen your entropy is going to be 1 h of\nthen your entropy is going to be 1 h of s if your probability is completely one\ns if your probability is completely one\ns if your probability is completely one that basically means either you're\nthat basically means either you're\nthat basically means either you're getting completely yes or completely no\ngetting completely yes or completely no\ngetting completely yes or completely no so your your entropy will be zero that\nso your your entropy will be zero that\nso your your entropy will be zero that basically means it is pure split so in\nbasically means it is pure split so in\nbasically means it is pure split so in the case of probability .5 you're\nthe case of probability .5 you're\nthe case of probability .5 you're getting plus one then it'll keep on\ngetting plus one then it'll keep on\ngetting plus one then it'll keep on reducing now let's go ahead and let's\nreducing now let's go ahead and let's\nreducing now let's go ahead and let's try to understand so here you have\ntry to understand so here you have\ntry to understand so here you have understood about purity test definitely\nunderstood about purity test definitely\nunderstood about purity test definitely you'll use entropy try to find out\nyou'll use entropy try to find out\nyou'll use entropy try to find out whether it is pure or impure if it is\nwhether it is pure or impure if it is\nwhether it is pure or impure if it is impure you go ahead with the further\nimpure you go ahead with the further\nimpure you go ahead with the further shift further division of the categories\nshift further division of the categories\nshift further division of the categories again you take another feature divide it\nagain you take another feature divide it\nagain you take another feature divide it because here from this two which

have five and then you have six now whenever you have\nthen you have six now whenever you have\nthen you have six now whenever you have a continuous feature so how the\na continuous feature so how the\na continuous feature so how the continuous feature will basically work\ncontinuous feature will basically work\ncontinuous feature will basically work in this case first of all your decision\nin this case first of all your decision\nin this case first of all your decision tree node will say\ntree node will say\ntree node will say that we'll take this one only one first\nthat we'll take this one only one first\nthat we'll take this one only one first record and say that if it is less than\nrecord and say that if it is less than\nrecord and say that if it is less than or equal to 1.3\nor equal to 1.3\nor equal to 1.3 okay if it is less than or equal to 1.3\nokay if it is less than or equal to 1.3\nokay if it is less than or equal to 1.3 so you here you'll be getting two\nso you here you'll be getting two\nso you here you'll be getting two branches yes or no so yes and no\nbranches yes or no so yes and no\nbranches yes or no so yes and no definitely your output over here will be\ndefinitely your output over here will be\ndefinitely your output over here will be put over here right and then for the no\nput over here right and then for the no\nput over here right and then for the no here you'll be having another node over\nhere you'll be having another node over\nhere you'll be having another node over here how many number of Records you'll\nhere how many number of Records you'll\nhere how many number of Records you'll be having in this particular case you'll\nbe having in this particular case you'll\nbe having in this particular case you'll be having one record in this particular\nbe having one record in this particular\nbe having one record in this particular case you will be having around five to\ncase you will be having around five to\ncase you will be having around five to six records and here also you'll be able\nsix records and here also you'll be able\nsix records and here also you'll be able to see right how many yes and NOS are\nto see right how many yes and NOS are\nto see right how many yes and NOS are there definitely this will be a leaf\nthere definitely this will be a leaf\nthere definitely this will be a leaf node so in the first instance they will\nnode so in the first instance they will\nnode so in the first instance they will go ahead and calculate the information\ngo ahead and calculate the information\ngo ahead and calculate the information gain of this then probably once the\ngain of this then probably once the\ngain of this then probably once the Information Gain Is got then what\nInformation Gain Is got then what\nInformation Gain Is got then what they'll do they will take the first two\nthey'll do they will take the first two\nthey'll do they will take the first two records and again create a new decision\nrecords and again create a new decision\nrecords and again create a new decision tree let's say that this will be my\ntree let's say that this will be my\ntree let's say that this will be my suggestion where they'll say it is less\nsuggestion where they'll say it is less\nsuggestion where they'll say it is less than or equal to 2.3 so I will get one\nthan or equal to 2.3 so I will get one\nthan or equal to 2.3 so I will get one and one over here so in this now you'll\nand one over here so in this now you'll\nand one over here so in this now you'll be having two records which will\nbe having two records which will\nbe having two records which will basically say how many yes and no are\nbasically say how many yes and no are\nbasically say how many yes and no are there and remaining all records will\nthere and remaining all records will\nthere and remaining all records will come over here then again Information\ncome over here then again Information\ncome over here then again Information Gain will be computed here then again\nGain will be computed here then again\nGain will be computed here then again what will happen they'll go to the next\nwhat will happen they'll go to the next\nwhat will happen they'll go to the next record then then again they'll create\nrecord then then again they'll create\nrecord then then again they'll create another feature where they'll say less\nanother feature where they'll say less\nanother feature where they'll say less than or equal to three and they will\nthan or equal to three and they will\nthan or equal to three and they will create this many nodes again they'll try\ncreate this many nodes again they'll try\ncreate this many nodes again they'll try to understand that how many yes or no\nto understand that how many yes or no\nto understand that how many yes or no are there and then they'll again compute\nare there and then they'll again compute\nare there and then they'll again compute The Information Gain like this they'll\nThe Information Gain like this they'll\nThe Information Gain like this they'll do it for each and every record and\ndo it for each and every record and\ndo it for each and every record and finally whichever Information Gain is\nfinally whichever Information Gain is\nfinally whichever Information Gain is higher they will select that specific\nhigher they will select that specific\nhigher they will select that specific value in that feature and they'll split\nvalue in that feature and they'll split\nvalue in that feature and they'll split the node so in a continuous feature\nthe node so in a continuous feature\nthe node so in a continuous feature whenever you have a continuous feature\nwhenever you have a continuous feature\nwhenever you have a continuous feature this is how it will basically have and\nthis is how it will basically have and\nthis is how it will basically have and then it will try to compute who is\nthen it will try to compute who is\nthen it will try to compute who is having the highest Information Gain the\nhaving the highest Information Gain the\nhaving the highest Information Gain the best Information Gain will get selected\nbest Information Gain will get selected\nbest Information Gain will get selected and from there the splitting will\nand from there the splitting will\nand from there the splitting will happen now let's go ahead and understand\nhappen now let's go ahead and understand\nhappen now let's go ahead and understand about the next topic is that how this\nabout the next topic is that how this\nabout the next topic is that how this entirely things work in decision tree\nentirely things work in decision tree\nentirely things work in decision tree regressor because in decision tree\nregressor because in decision tree\nregressor because in decision tree regressor my output is an continuous\nregressor my output is an continuous\nregressor my output is an continuous variable so suppose if I have one\nvariable so suppose if I have one\nvariable so suppose if I have one feature one feature two and this output\nfeature one feature two and this output\nfeature one feature two and this output is a continuous feature it will be\nis a continuous feature it will be\nis a continuous feature it will be continuous any value can be there so in\ncontinuous any value can be there so in\ncontinuous any value can be there so in this particular case how do I split it\nthis particular case how do I split it\nthis particular case how do I split it so let's say that f1c feature is getting\nso let's say that f1c feature is getting\nso let's say that f1c feature is getting selected now in this f1c feature what\nselected now in this f1c feature what\nselected now in this f1c feature what value will come when it is getting\nvalue will come when it is getting\nvalue will come when it is getting selected first of all the entire mean\nselected first of all the entire mean\nselected first of all the entire mean will get calculated of the output mean\nwill get calculated of the output mean\nwill get calculated of the output mean will get calculated so here I will have\nwill get calculated so here I will have\nwill get calculated so here I will have the mean and here here the cost function\nthe mean and here here the cost function\nthe mean and here here the cost function that is used is not Guinea coefficient\nthat is used is not Guinea coefficient\nthat is used is not Guinea coefficient or guinea impurity or entropy here we\nor guinea impurity or entropy here we\nor guinea impurity or entropy here we use mean squared\nuse mean squared\nuse mean squared error or you can also use mean absolute\nerror or you can also use mean absolute\nerror or you can also use mean absolute error now what is mean squared error if\nerror now what is mean squared error if\nerror now what is mean squared error if you remember from our logistic linear\nyou remember from our logistic linear\nyou remember from our logistic linear regression how do we calculate 1 by 2 m\nregression how do we calculate 1 by 2 m\nregression how do we calculate 1 by 2 m summation of I = 1 to n y hat minus y\nsummation of I = 1 to n y hat minus y\nsummation of I = 1 to n y hat minus y whole Square y hat of i y - y whole\nwhole Square y hat of i y - y whole\nwhole Square y hat of i y - y whole Square this is what is mean square error\nSquare this is what is mean square error\nSquare this is what is mean square error so what it will do first based on F1\nso what it will do first based on F1\nso what it will do first based on F1 feature it will try to assign a mean\nfeature it will try to assign a mean\nfeature it will try to assign a mean value and then it will compute the MSE\nvalue and then it will compute the MSE\nvalue and then it will compute the MSE value and then it'll go ahead and do the\nvalue and then it'll go ahead and do the\nvalue and then it'll go ahead and do the splitting now when it is doing splitting\nsplitting now when it is doing splitting\nsplitting now when it is doing splitting based on categories of continuous\nbased on categories of continuous\nbased on categories of continuous variable I will be having different\nvariable I will be having different\nvariable I will be having different different categories now in this\ndifferent categories now in this\ndifferent categories now in this categories what will happen after split\ncategories what will happen after split\ncategories what will happen after split some records will go over\nsome records will go over\nsome records will go over here then I will be having a mean value\nhere then I will be having a mean value\nhere then I will be having a mean value of this over here\nof this over here\nof this over here that will be my output and then again\nthat will be my output and then again\nthat will be my output and then again the MSC will get calculated over here as\nthe MSC will get calculated over here as\nthe MSC will get calculated over here as the msse gets reduced that basically\nthe msse gets reduced that basically\nthe msse gets reduced that basically means we are reaching near the leaf\nmeans we are reaching near the leaf\nmeans we are reaching near the leaf note and the same thing will happen over\nnote and the same thing will happen over\nnote and the same thing will happen over here so finally when you follow this\nhere so finally when you follow this\nhere so finally when you follow this path whatever mean value is present over\npath whatever mean value is present over\npath whatever mean value is present over here that will be your output this is\nhere that will be your output this is\nhere that will be your output this is the difference between the decision tree\nthe difference between the decision tree\nthe difference between the decision tree regressor and the classifier here\nregressor and the classifier here\nregressor and the classifier here instead of using entropy and all you use\ninstead of using entropy and all you use\ninstead of using entropy and all you use mean squar error or mean absolute error\nmean squar error or mean

based on one feature here\non one feature based on one feature here\non one feature based on one feature here you'll be able to see that you are\nyou'll be able to see that you are\nyou'll be able to see that you are getting a leaf node based on another\ngetting a leaf node based on another\ngetting a leaf node based on another Branch here you are getting\nBranch here you are getting\nBranch here you are getting 05050 so again you have two more\n05050 so again you have two more\n05050 so again you have two more features getting splitted over here so\nfeatures getting splitted over here so\nfeatures getting splitted over here so here you have 495 here you have\nhere you have 495 here you have\nhere you have 495 here you have 471 do we require this split anybody\n471 do we require this split anybody\n471 do we require this split anybody tell me from here do we require any any\ntell me from here do we require any any\ntell me from here do we require any any more split just try to think this is\nmore split just try to think this is\nmore split just try to think this is after post pruning I want to find out\nafter post pruning I want to find out\nafter post pruning I want to find out whether more splits are required or not\nwhether more splits are required or not\nwhether more splits are required or not now in this particular case you see this\nnow in this particular case you see this\nnow in this particular case you see this after this do you require any\nafter this do you require any\nafter this do you require any split you do not require right here you\nsplit you do not require right here you\nsplit you do not require right here you are basically getting 47 and one I guess\nare basically getting 47 and one I guess\nare basically getting 47 and one I guess after this also you require no split\nafter this also you require no split\nafter this also you require no split understand this so this is basically\nunderstand this so this is basically\nunderstand this so this is basically post pruning so you can then decide your\npost pruning so you can then decide your\npost pruning so you can then decide your level and probably do it gu value is\nlevel and probably do it gu value is\nlevel and probably do it gu value is more than\nmore than\nmore than 0.5 okay this side H this is coming as\n0.5 okay this side H this is coming as\n0.5 okay this side H this is coming as 0.5 greater than 0.5 it should not had\n0.5 greater than 0.5 it should not had\n0.5 greater than 0.5 it should not had here it is\nhere it is\nhere it is 0.5 no maximum .5 can come 0 to.5 only\n0.5 no maximum .5 can come 0 to.5 only\n0.5 no maximum .5 can come 0 to.5 only should come I don't know why this is\nshould come I don't know why this is\nshould come I don't know why this is coming as 667\nI'll have a look onto this guys but\nI'll have a look onto this guys but anywhere you see other than that you're\nanywhere you see other than that you're\nanywhere you see other than

okay so emble\nemble techniques is okay so emble\nemble techniques is okay so emble techniques in emble techniques we\ntechniques in emble techniques we\ntechniques in emble techniques we specifically use two different ways one\nspecifically use two different ways one\nspecifically use two different ways one is one one way is that we specifically\nis one one way is that we specifically\nis one one way is that we specifically use and the other one I'll just go to\nuse and the other one I'll just go to\nuse and the other one I'll just go to write it over here so one that we\nwrite it over here so one that we\nwrite it over here so one that we basically use is something called as\nbasically use is something called as\nbasically use is something called as bagging technique and the other one we\nbagging technique and the other one we\nbagging technique and the other one we specifically use is something called as\nspecifically use is something called as\nspecifically use is something called as boosting technique so in bagging\nboosting technique so in bagging\nboosting technique so in bagging Technique we what exactly we can do and\nTechnique we what exactly we can do and\nTechnique we what exactly we can do and in boosting technique what we can\nin boosting technique what we can\nin boosting technique what we can actually do and how we are combining\nactually do and how we are combining\nactually do and how we are combining multiple models to solve a problem so\nmultiple models to solve a problem so\nmultiple models to solve a problem so let's first of all discuss about bagging\nlet's first of all discuss about bagging\nlet's first of all discuss about bagging now how does bagging work let's say that\nnow how does bagging work let's say that\nnow how does bagging work let's say that I have a specific data set so this is my\nI have a specific data set so this is my\nI have a specific data set so this is my data set with uh with features rows\ndata set with uh with features rows\ndata set with uh with features rows columns everything like this I have this\ncolumns everything like this I have this\ncolumns everything like this I have this specific data set just imagine I have\nspecific data set just imagine I have\nspecific data set just imagine I have many many features over here like this\nmany many features over here like this\nmany many features over here like this fub1 F2 F3 and probably I have my output\nfub1 F2 F3 and probably I have my output\nfub1 F2 F3 and probably I have my output so this is my data set D let's consider\nso this is my data set D let's consider\nso this is my data set D let's consider it now what we do in bagging is that we\nit now what we do in bagging is that we\nit now what we do in bagging is that we create models and this model can be\ncreate models and this model can be\ncreate models and this model can be anything it can be logistic it can be\nanything it can be logistic it can be\nanything it can be logistic it can be linear for a classification problem\nlinear for a classification problem\nlinear for a classification problem let's say that this is logistic model so\nlet's say that this is logistic model so\nlet's say that this is logistic model so this is my model M1 let's say I have\nthis is my model M1 let's say I have\nthis is my model M1 let's say I have another model M2 then I may have another\nanother model M2 then I may have another\nanother model M2 then I may have another model M3 let's say that this is\nmodel M3 let's say that this is\nmodel M3 let's say that this is logistic and this is probably the other\nlogistic and this is probably the other\nlogistic and this is probably the other model which is like decision tree and\nmodel which is like decision tree and\nmodel which is like decision tree and then probably we use this model as KNN\nthen probably we use this model as KNN\nthen probably we use this model as KNN classification and this model can again\nclassification and this model can again\nclassification and this model can again be decision tree it's fine let's use\nbe decision tree it's fine let's use\nbe decision tree it's fine let's use another decision tree so now here you\nanother decision tree so now here you\nanother decision tree so now here you can see that we have used so many models\ncan see that we have used so many models\ncan see that we have used so many models okay so many models are there now with\nokay so many models are there now with\nokay so many models are there now with respect to this particular model what I\nrespect to this particular model what I\nrespect to this particular model what I will do is that the first step that I\nwill do is that the first step that I\nwill do is that the first step that I will do from this particular data set I\nwill do from this particular data set I\nwill do from this particular data set I will just take up some rows so I'll\nwill just take up some rows so I'll\nwill just take up some rows so I'll basically do row\nbasically do row\nbasically do row sampling and I'll take a row sampling of\nsampling and I'll take a row sampling of\nsampling and I'll take a row sampling of D Dash D Das basically means this D Das\nD Dash D Das basically means this D Das\nD Dash D Das basically means this D Das is always less than D some of the rows\nis always less than D some of the rows\nis always less than D some of the rows I'll push it to M1 okay I can also use n\nI'll push it to M1 okay I can also use n\nI'll push it to M1 okay I can also use n fine so what I'll do is that some of the\nfine so what I'll do is that some of the\nfine so what I'll do is that some of the rows I'll push it to model one this\nrows I'll push it to model one this\nrows I'll push it to model one this model one will be training let's say\nmodel one will be training let's say\nmodel one will be training let's say that for out of this 10,000 record th000\nthat for out of this 10,000 record th000\nthat for out of this 10,000 record th000 rows I'm actually doing a row sampling\nrows I'm actually doing a row sampling\nrows I'm actually doing a row sampling of th rows and giving it to M1 to train\nof th rows and giving it to M1 to train\nof th rows and giving it to M1 to train it then what I'm actually going to do\nit then what I'm actually going to do\nit then what I'm actually going to do over here I'm basically going to give\nover here I'm basically going to give\nover here I'm basically going to give this specific model M2 and again I'm\nthis specific model M2 and again I'm\nthis specific model M2 and again I'm going to do row row sampling and I'm\ngoing to do row row sampling and I'm\ngoing to do row row sampling and I'm again going to sample some of the rows\nagain going to sample some of the rows\nagain going to sample some of the rows and give it to model two and again\nand give it to model two and again\nand give it to model two and again remember some of the rows may get\nremember some of the rows may get\nremember some of the rows may get repeated from this D Dash to next dble\nrepeated from this D Dash to next dble\nrepeated from this D Dash to next dble Dash similarly I will do row sampling\nDash similarly I will do row sampling\nDash similarly I will do row sampling and give it to this and again I may have\nand give it to this and again I may have\nand give it to this and again I may have d triple Dash and D4 Dash so different\nd triple Dash and D4 Dash so different\nd triple Dash and D4 Dash so different different different different rows data\ndifferent different different rows data\ndifferent different different rows data points when I say row sampling basically\npoints when I say row sampling basically\npoints when I say row sampling basically I'm talking about data points different\nI'm talking about data points different\nI'm talking about data points different different data points I will give it to\ndifferent data points I will give it to\ndifferent data points I will give it to separate separate model and this model\nseparate separate model and this model\nseparate separate model and this model will specifically train when I say D\nwill specifically train when I say D\nwill specifically train when I say D Dash that basically means uh suppose I\nDash that basically means uh suppose I\nDash that basically means uh suppose I say th 10,000 are my total number of\nsay th 10,000 are my total number of\nsay th 10,000 are my total number of data points when I say D Dash This D\ndata points when I say D Dash This D\ndata points when I say D Dash This D Dash may be th000 points then D Double\nDash may be th000 points then D Double\nDash may be th000 points then D Double Dash may be another th000 points and\nDash may be another th000 points and\nDash may be another th000 points and some of the rows may get repeated over\nsome of the rows may get repeated over\nsome of the rows may get repeated over here dle Dash here also I can basically\nhere dle Dash here also I can basically\nhere dle Dash here also I can basically use so here specifically row sampling\nuse so here specifically row sampling\nuse so here specifically row sampling will be used now when I have this many\nwill be used now when I have this many\nwill be used now when I have this many specific each and every model will be\nspecific each and every model will be\nspecific each and every model will be trained with different kind of data now\ntrained with different kind of data now\ntrained with different kind of data now how the inferencing will happen for the\nhow the inferencing will happen for the\nhow the inferencing will happen for the test data so first thing first let's say\ntest data so first thing first let's say\ntest data so first thing first let's say that I'm going to get a new test data\nthat I'm going to get a new test data\nthat I'm going to get a new test data over here now new test data will be\nover here now new test data will be\nover here now new test data will be passed to M1 and this M1 suppose it\npassed to M1 and this M1 suppose it\npassed to M1 and this M1 suppose it gives zero as my output suppose let's\ngives zero as my output suppose let's\ngives zero as my output suppose let's say that I'm doing a binary\nsay that I'm doing a binary\nsay that I'm doing a binary classification it gives a Zer as an\nclassification it gives a Zer as an\nclassification it gives a Zer as an output so this is my output of zero next\noutput so this is my output of zero next\noutput so this is my output of zero next M2 for the new test data gives one M3\nM2 for the new test data gives one M3\nM2 for the new test data gives one M3 gives one and M4 also gives one as the\ngives one and M4 also gives one as the\ngives one and M4 also gives one as the the output now in this particular case\nthe output now in this particular case\nthe output now in this particular case in this particular case what will happen\nin this particular case what will happen\nin this particular case what will happen now you can see over here it's simple\nnow you can see over here it's simple\nnow you can see over here it's simple what what do you think the output may be\nwhat what do you think the output may be\nwhat what do you think the output may be in this particular case now M1 has\nin this particular case now M1 has\nin this particular case now M1 has predicted for this particular test data\npredicted for this particular test data\npredicted for this particular test data as zero the model M2 has predicted 1 M3\nas zero the model M2 has predicted 1 M3\nas zero the model M2 has predicted 1 M3 has predicted 1 and M4 has predicted one\nhas predicted 1 and M4 has predicted one\nhas predicted 1 and M4 has predicted one so finally all these outputs are going\nso finally all these outputs are going\nso finally all these outputs are going to get\nto get\nto get aggregated are going to get aggregated\naggregated are going to get aggregated\naggregated are going to get aggregated and a simple thing that gets applied is\nand a simple thing that gets applied is\nand a simple thing that gets applied is majority voting majority voting so tell\nmajority voting majority voting so tell\nmajority voting majority voting so tell me what will be the output for with\nme what will be the output for with\nme what will be the output for with respect to this the output will\nrespect to this the output will\nrespect to this the output will obviously be one because the majority\nobviously be one because the majority\nobviously be one because the majority voting that you can see three people are\nvoting that you can see three people are\nvoting that you can see three people are basically saying it as one so my output\nbasically saying it as one so my output\nbasically saying it as one so my output over here will be one okay this is the\nover here will be one okay this is the\nover here will be one okay this is the concept of bagging wherein you are\nconcept of bagging wherein you are\nconcept of bagging wherein you are providing different different rows with\nproviding different different rows with\nproviding different different rows with probably all the features in this case\nprobably all the features in this case\nprobably all the features in this case and giving it to different different\nand giving it to different different\nand giving it to different different model again which is a classification\nmodel again which is a classification\nmodel again which is a classification model and then finally you are combining\nmodel and then finally you are combining\nmodel and then finally you are combining them based on majority voting and you're\nthem based on majority voting and you're\nthem based on majority voting and you're getting the answer as one so this step\ngetting the answer as one so this step\ngetting the answer as one so this step is called as bootstrap aggregator that\nis called as bootstrap aggregator that\nis called as bootstrap aggregator that basically means you're aggregating all\nbasically means you're aggregating all\nbasically means you're aggregating all the output that is basically coming from\nthe output that is basically coming from\nthe output that is basically coming from all the specific models all the specific\nall the specific models all the specific\nall the specific models all the specific models now many people will say Krish\nmodels now many people will say Krish\nmodels now many people will say Krish what about Tai guys like this kind of\nwhat about Tai guys like this kind of\nwhat about Tai guys like this kind of situation you know we will be having\nsituation you know we will be having\nsituation you know we will be having more than 100 to 200 models so it is\nmore than 100 to 200 models so it is\nmore than 100 to 200 models so it is very very difficult that it will be a\nvery very difficult that it will be a\nvery very difficult that it will be a tie who are repeating questions they\ntie who are repeating questions they\ntie who are repeating questions they will be put up in time out so what if\nwill be put up in time out so what if\nwill be put up in time out so what if you're saying that if the 50% of model\nyou're saying that if the 50% of model\nyou're saying that if the 50% of model says yes 50% of our models says no\nsays yes 50% of our models says no\nsays yes 50% of our models says no always understand guys we will be having\nalways understand guys we will be having\nalways understand guys we will be having more than 100 to 200 plus models so in\nmore than 100 to 200 plus models so in\nmore than 100 to 200 plus models so in this particular case there will be high\nthis particular case there will be high\nthis particular case there will be high probability that always there will be a\nprobability that always there will be a\nprobability that always there will be a majority voting available it will always\nmajority voting available it will always\nmajority voting available it will always not be in that specific scenario so this\nnot be in that specific scenario so this\nnot be in that specific scenario so this was the concept about bagging now some\nwas the concept about bagging now some\nwas the concept about bagging now some people will be saying that Krish why are\npeople will be saying that Krish why are\npeople will be saying that Krish why are you using different different models\nyou using different different models\nyou using different different models guys I'm not discussing about random\nguys I'm not discussing about random\nguys I'm not discussing about random Forest over here random Forest uses only\nForest over here random Forest uses only\nForest over here random Forest uses only one type of model that is decision tree\none type of model that is decision tree\none type of model that is decision tree but if we think as an concept of bagging\nbut if we think as an concept of bagging\nbut if we think as an concept of bagging you can have different different models\nyou can have different different models\nyou can have different different models over here and you can basically combine\nover here and you can basically combine\nover here and you can basically combine them so this is a technique of emble\nthem so this is a technique of emble\nthem so this is a technique of emble techniques and this is basically called\ntechniques and this is basically called\ntechniques and this is basically called as bagging okay now tell me one point I\nas bagging okay now tell me one point I\nas bagging okay now tell me one point I missed out fine this is with respect to\nmissed out fine this is with respect to\nmissed out fine this is with respect to the classification problem with respect\nthe classification problem with respect\nthe classification problem with respect to the regression problem what will\nto the regression problem what will\nto the regression problem what will happen in case of a regression problem\nhappen in case of a regression problem\nhappen in case of a regression problem let's say that I got here 120 here 140\nlet's say that I got here 120 here 140\nlet's say that I got here 120 here 140 here 122 here 148 as my output so in\nhere 122 here 148 as my output so in\nhere 122 here 148 as my output so in regression what will happen is that the\nregression what will happen is that the\nregression what will happen is that the entire mean will be taken mean will be\nentire mean will be taken mean will be\nentire mean will be taken mean will be taken the output mean will be basically\ntaken the output mean will be basically\ntaken the output mean will be basically taken and that will be your output of\ntaken and that will be your output of\ntaken and that will be your output of the model average or mean very simple\nthe model average or mean very simple\nthe model average or mean very simple right so average or mean will be\nright so average or mean will be\nright so average or mean will be basically taken up and here based on the\nbasically taken up and here based on the\nbasically taken up and here based on the average you'll be able to solve the\naverage you'll be able to solve the\naverage you'll be able to solve the regression problem great now let's go\nregression problem great now let's go\nregression problem great now let's go ahead and try to understand with respect\nahead and try to understand with respect\nahead and try to understand with respect to bagging and boosting how many\nto bagging and boosting how many\nto bagging and boosting how many different types of algorithm are but\ndifferent types of algorithm are but\ndifferent types of algorithm are but before that I need to make you\nbefore that I need to make you\nbefore that I need to make you understand what exactly is boosting now\nunderstand what exactly is boosting now\nunderstand what exactly is boosting now here in bagging you have seen that you\nhere in bagging you have seen that you\nhere in bagging you have seen that you have parallel models right one one one\nhave parallel models right one one one\nhave parallel models right one one one independent you have parallel models\nindependent you have parallel models\nindependent you have parallel models you're giving some row samples in\nyou're giving some row samples in\nyou're giving some row samples in different different models and basically\ndifferent different models and basically\ndifferent different models and basically are able to find out the output now in\nare able to find out the output now in\nare able to find out the output now in case of boosting boosting is a\ncase of boosting boosting is a\ncase of boosting boosting is a sequential combination of models like\nsequential combination of models like\nsequential combination of models like this you have lot of sequential models\nthis you have lot of sequential models\nthis you have lot of sequential models like this and one after the model like\nlike this and one after the model like\nlike this and one after the model like first I'll give my training data to this\nfirst I'll give my training data to this\nfirst I'll give my training data to this particular model then it will go to this\nparticular model then it will go to this\nparticular model then it will go to this data then this model then this model so\ndata then this model then this model so\ndata then this model then this model so this will be my M1 M2 M3 M4 and finally\nthis will be my M1 M2 M3 M4 and finally\nthis will be my M1 M2 M3 M4 and finally I will be getting my output so here you\nI will be getting my output so here you\nI will be getting my output so here you can basically say that boosting is all\ncan basically say that boosting is all\ncan basically say that boosting is all about and this M1 M2 M3 we basically\nabout and this M1 M2 M3 we basically\nabout and this M1 M2 M3 we basically mention it as weak Learners so this will\nmention it as weak Learners so this will\nmention it as weak Learners so this will be weak learner weak learner weak\nbe weak learner weak learner weak\nbe weak learner weak learner weak learner weak learner and finally when we\nlearner weak learner and finally when we\nlearner weak learner and finally when we go till here it it'll if I combine all\ngo till here it it'll if I combine all\ngo till here it it'll if I combine all these weak ners weak\nthese weak ners weak\nthese weak ners weak learner weak learner okay once I combine\nlearner weak learner okay once I combine\nlearner weak learner okay once I combine all this weak learner it becomes a it\nall this weak learner it becomes a it\nall this weak learner it becomes a it becomes a strong learner finally if I\nbecomes a strong learner finally if I\nbecomes a strong learner finally if I try to combine this this will basically\ntry to combine this this will basically\ntry to combine this this will basically become a strong learner so here you have\nbecome a strong learner so here you have\nbecome a strong learner so here you have all the models sequentially one after\nall the models sequentially one after\nall the models

the data also that split won't be that much important but if I talk\nbe that much important but if I talk\nbe that much important but if I talk about KNN whether standardization\nabout KNN whether standardization\nabout KNN whether standardization normalization required over here the\nnormalization required over here the\nnormalization required over here the answer is yes because here we use two\nanswer is yes because here we use two\nanswer is yes because here we use two things one is ukan distance and\nthings one is ukan distance and\nthings one is ukan distance and Manhattan distance because of this you\nManhattan distance because of this you\nManhattan distance because of this you definitely have to apply standardization\ndefinitely have to apply standardization\ndefinitely have to apply standardization so that the computation or distance\nso that the computation or distance\nso that the computation or distance becomes easy so this is one of the most\nbecomes easy so this is

there is a lot\nat least you know I know there is a lot\nat least you know I know there is a lot of confusion within you all but we'll\nof confusion within you all but we'll\nof confusion within you all but we'll try to solve a problem let's say so\ntry to solve a problem let's say so\ntry to solve a problem let's say so suppose I have a data set which looks\nsuppose I have a data set which looks\nsuppose I have a data set which looks like this fub1 F2 F3 F4 so these are my\nlike this fub1 F2 F3 F4 so these are my\nlike this fub1 F2 F3 F4 so these are my features and probably these are my\nfeatures and probably these are my\nfeatures and probably these are my output okay so let's say that I'm having\noutput okay so let's say that I'm having\noutput okay so let's say that I'm having this features like this and this is my\nthis features like this and this is my\nthis features like this and this is my output like yes or no like this so let's\noutput like yes or no like this so let's\noutput like yes or no like this so let's say that how many records I have over\nsay that how many records I have over\nsay that how many records I have over here three\nhere three\nhere three 4 5 6 and one more is there 7 so this\n4 5 6 and one more is there 7 so this\n4 5 6 and one more is there 7 so this seven records are there now in adab\nseven records are there now in adab\nseven records are there now in adab boost the first thing is that\nboost the first thing is that\nboost the first thing is that specifically with adab Boost uh you\nspecifically with adab Boost uh you\nspecifically with adab Boost uh you really need to understand that what all\nreally need to understand that what all\nreally need to understand that what all things we can basically do how do we\nthings we can basically do how do we\nthings we can basically do how do we solve this classification problem that\nsolve this classification problem that\nsolve this classification problem that we are going to understand the first\nwe are going to understand the first\nwe are going to understand the first thing first is that we Define a weight\nthing first is that we Define a weight\nthing first is that we Define a weight and the weight is very much simple\nand the weight is very much simple\nand the weight is very much simple initially to all the records to all this\ninitially to all the records to all this\ninitially to all the records to all this input records we provide an equal weight\ninput records we provide an equal weight\ninput records we provide an equal weight now how do we provide an equal weight we\nnow how do we provide an equal weight we\nnow how do we provide an equal weight we just go and count how many number of\njust go and count how many number of\njust go and count how many number of records are there now in this particular\nrecords are there now in this particular\nrecords are there now in this particular case the total number of records are one\ncase the total number of records are one\ncase the total number of records are one 2 3 4 5 6 7 now every record I have to\n2 3 4 5 6 7 now every record I have to\n2 3 4 5 6 7 now every record I have to provide an equal weight that is between\nprovide an equal weight that is between\nprovide an equal weight that is between 0 to 1 so the overall sum should be one\n0 to 1 so the overall sum should be one\n0 to 1 so the overall sum should be one so in this particular case what I can do\nso in this particular case what I can do\nso in this particular case what I can do if I make 1X 7 1X 7 1X 7 to everyone\nif I make 1X 7 1X 7 1X 7 to everyone\nif I make 1X 7 1X 7 1X 7 to everyone this will definitely become\nthis will definitely become\nthis will definitely become a equal weights to all right and if I do\na equal weights to all right and if I do\na equal weights to all right and if I do the total sum it will obviously be one\nthe total sum it will obviously be one\nthe total sum it will obviously be one let's go to the next one now after this\nlet's go to the next one now after this\nlet's go to the next one now after this what do we do okay after this in adab\nwhat do we do okay after this in adab\nwhat do we do okay after this in adab the first thing that we do is that we\nthe first thing that we do is that we\nthe first thing that we do is that we take any of this feature how do you\ntake any of this feature how do you\ntake any of this feature how do you decide which feature to take whether we\ndecide which feature to take whether we\ndecide which feature to take whether we should go with F1 or whether we should\nshould go with F1 or whether we should\nshould go with F1 or whether we should go with FS2 or whether we should go with\ngo with FS2 or whether we should go with\ngo with FS2 or whether we should go with F3 this we can do it with the help of\nF3 this we can do it with the help of\nF3 this we can do it with the help of Information Gain and Information Gain\nInformation Gain and Information Gain\nInformation Gain and Information Gain and entropy or guinea right based on\nand entropy or guinea right based on\nand entropy or guinea right based on this we can definitely understand\nthis we can definitely understand\nthis we can definitely understand whether we should start making decision\nwhether we should start making decision\nwhether we should start making decision here also you specifically make decision\nhere also you specifically make decision\nhere also you specifically make decision trees so here what you do is that you\ntrees so here what you do is that you\ntrees so here what you do is that you probably have to determine by using\nprobably have to determine by using\nprobably have to determine by using which feature I have to start my\nwhich feature I have to start my\nwhich feature I have to start my decision tree so suppose out of all this\ndecision tree so suppose out of all this\ndecision tree so suppose out of all this feature one feature two feature three\nfeature one feature two feature three\nfeature one feature two feature three you have selected that okay the\nyou have selected that okay the\nyou have selected that okay the information gain and entropy of feature\ninformation gain and entropy of feature\ninformation gain and entropy of feature one is higher so I'm going to use\none is higher so I'm going to use\none is higher so I'm going to use feature one and probably divide this\nfeature one and probably divide this\nfeature one and probably divide this into decision trees now when I divide\ninto decision trees now when I divide\ninto decision trees now when I divide this into decision tree let's say that\nthis into decision tree let's say that\nthis into decision tree let's say that I'm dividing like this into decision\nI'm dividing like this into decision\nI'm dividing like this into decision tree this decision tree depth will be\ntree this decision tree depth will be\ntree this decision tree depth will be only one one depth and this depth since\nonly one one depth and this depth since\nonly one one depth and this depth since it has only one depth we basically call\nit has only one depth we basically call\nit has only one depth we basically call it as stumps so what we do over here\nit as stumps so what we do over here\nit as stumps so what we do over here specifically we will create a decision\nspecifically we will create a decision\nspecifically we will create a decision Tre by taking only one feature and we\nTre by taking only one feature and we\nTre by taking only one feature and we will only divide it to one level okay\nwill only divide it to one level okay\nwill only divide it to one level okay one level or one depth that's\none level or one depth that's\none level or one depth that's and this is specifically called as stump\nand this is specifically called as stump\nand this is specifically called as stump what we are going to do next is that\nwhat we are going to do next is that\nwhat we are going to do next is that from this particular stump okay the\nfrom this particular stump okay the\nfrom this particular stump okay the stump is basically getting created only\nstump is basically getting created only\nstump is basically getting created only one so that is adab Boost right we say\none so that is adab Boost right we say\none so that is adab Boost right we say it as weak Learners because this is weak\nit as weak Learners because this is weak\nit as weak Learners because this is weak learner weak learner why there is a\nlearner weak learner why there is a\nlearner weak learner why there is a reason we say this as weak learner so\nreason we say this as weak learner so\nreason we say this as weak learner so only weak learner so that is the first\nonly weak learner so that is the first\nonly weak learner so that is the first thing with respect to uh this particular\nthing with respect to uh this particular\nthing with respect to uh this particular adab boost so the first step is that\nadab boost so the first step is that\nadab boost so the first step is that this is a weak learner so for the weak\nthis is a weak learner so for the weak\nthis is a weak learner so for the weak learner we basically create a stump\nlearner we basically create a stump\nlearner we basically create a stump stump basically means one level decision\nstump basically means one level decision\nstump basically means one level decision tree that's it based on the information\ntree that's it based on the information\ntree that's it based on the information gain and entropy I have selected the\ngain and entropy I have selected the\ngain and entropy I have selected the feature and then I just made a decision\nfeature and then I just made a decision\nfeature and then I just made a decision tree with only one level why it is\ntree with only one level why it is\ntree with only one level why it is called as it is called as weak learner\ncalled as it is called as weak learner\ncalled as it is called as weak learner okay so that is the reason we use only\nokay so that is the reason we use only\nokay so that is the reason we use only stum that is just a one level decision\nstum that is just a one level decision\nstum that is just a one level decision tree now the next step happens is that\ntree now the next step happens is that\ntree now the next step happens is that we provide all the specific records to\nwe provide all the specific records to\nwe provide all the specific records to this F1 and we train this specific model\nthis F1 and we train this specific model\nthis F1 and we train this specific model only with one level decision tree we\nonly with one level decision tree we\nonly with one level decision tree we train them\ntrain them\ntrain them now after we train them let's say that\nnow after we train them let's say that\nnow after we train them let's say that we are going to pass all these\nwe are going to pass all these\nwe are going to pass all these particular records to find out how many\nparticular records to find out how many\nparticular records to find out how many are correct and how many are wrong this\nare correct and how many are wrong this\nare correct and how many are wrong this decision this decision tree is basically\ndecision this decision tree is basically\ndecision this decision tree is basically giving so let's say that out of this\ngiving so let's say that out of this\ngiving so let's say that out of this entire records one\nentire

that this is the this is\nwrong let's say that this is the this is the record which was given as wrong okay\nthe record which was given as wrong okay\nthe record which was given as wrong okay so let's say that this record output was\nso let's say that this record output was\nso let's say that this record output was predicted wrong from this particular\npredicted wrong from this particular\npredicted wrong from this particular model only one wrong was there after\nmodel only one wrong was there after\nmodel only one wrong was there after training the model now what we need to\ntraining the model now what we need to\ntraining the model now what we need to do in this specific case understand a\ndo in this specific case understand a\ndo in this specific case understand a very important thing so let's say that\nvery important thing so let's say that\nvery important thing so let's say that we have done this and probably after\nwe have done this and probably after\nwe have done this and probably after this what we are actually going to do we\nthis what we are actually going to do we\nthis what we are actually going to do we are going to calculate the total

particular model made let's say that in this particular\nmade let's say that in this particular\nmade let's say that in this particular case only one was wrong so this was only\ncase only one was wrong so this was only\ncase only one was wrong so this was only wrong right one was wrong so if I want\nwrong right one was wrong so if I want\nwrong right one was wrong so if I want to calculate the total error how will I\nto calculate the total error how will I\nto calculate the total error how will I calculate how many how many of them are\ncalculate how many how many of them are\ncalculate how many how many of them are wrong how many of them are wrong only\nwrong how many of them are wrong only\nwrong how many of them are wrong only one is wrong what is the weight of this\none is wrong what

is the next step out of this now\nwhat is the next step out of this now\nwhat is the next step out of this now what what will be my third step\nwhat what will be my third step\nwhat what will be my third step understand over here my third step will\nunderstand over here my third step will\nunderstand over here my third step will be to update all these weights and that\nbe to update all these

performance of Step so\ntotal error and performance of Step so\ntotal error and performance of Step so my third step will basically be new\nmy third step will basically be new\nmy third step will basically be new sample weight from the decision tree one\nsample weight from the decision tree one\nsample weight from the decision tree one which is my stump so I'll say new sample\nwhich is my

I'll\nthese weights again understand I'll I'll talk about it just a second so if I want\ntalk about it just a second so if I want\ntalk about it just a second so if I want to up update the sample weights first\nto up update the sample weights first\nto up update the sample weights first update I will do it for correct records\nupdate I will do it for correct records\nupdate I will do it for correct records see for correct records whichever are\nsee for correct records whichever are\nsee for correct records whichever are correct like these all records are\ncorrect like these all records are\ncorrect like these all records are correct these all records are correct\ncorrect these all records are correct\ncorrect these all records are correct now when I update the weights of this\nnow when I update the weights of this\nnow when I update the weights of this update the weights of this particular\nupdate the weights of this particular\nupdate the weights of this particular record it should reduce and when the the\nrecord it should reduce and when the the\nrecord it should reduce and when the the the wrong records that I have this\nthe wrong records that I have this\nthe wrong records that I have this update should increase why because\nupdate should increase why because\nupdate should increase why because because if I increase this weights then\nbecause if I increase this weights then\nbecause if I increase this weights then the wrong records that are there that\nthe wrong records that are there that\nthe wrong records that are there that record should go to the next week\nrecord should go to the next week\nrecord should go to the next week learner that is the reason why I'm doing\nlearner that is the reason why I'm doing\nlearner that is the reason why I'm doing it now how to update this particular\nit now how to update this particular\nit now how to update this particular weights for correct records for correct\nweights for correct records for correct\nweights for correct records for correct records the formula looks something like\nrecords the formula looks something like\nrecords the formula looks something like this weight multiplied by

okay\nminus this specific performance okay\nminus this specific performance okay this specific performance so e to the\nthis specific performance so e to the\nthis specific performance so e to the power of PS I'll write performance of\npower of PS I'll write performance of\npower of PS I'll write performance of stump and then I will basically be able\nstump and then I will basically be able\nstump and then I will basically be able to write 1X 7 * e to the^ of minus\nto write 1X 7 * e to the^ of minus\nto write 1X 7 * e to the^ of minus 895 if I do the calculation everybody\n895 if I do the calculation everybody\n895 if I do the calculation everybody try to do it the answer will be\ntry to do it the answer will be\ntry to do it the answer will be 05 now this is for correct records what\n05 now this is for correct records what\n05 now this is for correct records what about incorrect records for the\nabout incorrect records for the\nabout incorrect records for the incorrect\nincorrect\nincorrect records the the weights that is going to\nrecords the the weights that is going to\nrecords the the weights that is going to the formula that we going to apply is\nthe formula that we going to apply is\nthe formula that we going to apply is multiplied by E to the^ of plus PS not\nmultiplied by E to the^ of plus PS not\nmultiplied by E to the^ of plus PS not minus PS plus PS so here I'll write 1 by\nminus PS plus PS so here I'll write 1 by\nminus PS plus PS so here I'll write 1 by 7 multiplied e to the^ of\n7 multiplied e to the^ of\n7 multiplied e to the^ of 895 so if I go and probably calcul this\n895 so if I go and probably calcul this\n895 so if I go and probably calcul this I'm going to get it\nI'm going to get it\nI'm going to get it as 349 so this two are the weights that\nas 349 so this two are the weights that\nas 349 so this two are the weights that I have got that basically means all\nI have got that basically means all\nI have got that basically means all these records now which are correct 1X 7\nthese records now which are correct 1X 7\nthese records now which are correct 1X 7 the new updated weights will be 05 05\nthe new updated weights will be 05 05\nthe new updated weights will be 05 05 05\n05\n05 05 sorry not for the wrong\n05 sorry not for the wrong\n05 sorry not for the wrong records then this will be 05 then 05 and\nrecords then this will be 05 then 05 and\nrecords then this will be 05 then 05 and 05 so let me just see what is 1x 7 so\n05 so let me just see what is 1x 7 so\n05 so let me just see what is 1x 7 so here you can see initially it was. 142\nhere you can see initially it was. 142\nhere you can see initially it was. 142 now it has got reduced to 05 because all\nnow it has got reduced to 05 because all\nnow it has got reduced to 05 because all these records are correct but the wrong\nthese records are correct but the wrong\nthese records are correct but the wrong record value is 349 so my

record is here fourth record is there 1\nrecord is here fourth record is there 1\nrecord is here fourth record is there 1 2 3 4 05 05 okay how many records are\n2 3 4 05 05 okay how many records are\n2 3 4 05 05 okay how many records are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so my fourth record\nthere 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so my fourth record\nthere 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so my fourth record will basically become the new value that\nwill basically become the new value that\nwill basically become the new value that I'm having is something called as\nI'm having is something called as\nI'm having is something called as 349 now tell me guys if I do the\n349 now tell me guys if I do the\n349 now tell me guys if I do the summation of all these weights is this\nsummation of all these weights is this\nsummation of all these weights is this is it one so prob\nis it one so prob\nis it one so prob no I don't think so it is one because if\nno I don't think so it is one because if\nno I don't think so it is one because if I try to add it up it is not one but if\nI try to add it up it is not one but if\nI try to add it up it is not one but if I go and see over here these all are one\nI go and see over here these all are

be one so we have to\nshould be one so we have to normalize now in order to normalize all\nnormalize now in order to normalize all\nnormalize now in order to normalize all you have to do is that go and find out\nyou have to do is that go and find out\nyou have to do is that go and find out what is the sum of all this things the\nwhat is the sum of all this things the\nwhat is the sum of all this

now what I\nmodel is giving one wrong now what I have to do is that whatever is wrong\nhave to do is that whatever is wrong\nhave to do is that whatever is wrong along with other data points I need to\nalong with other data points I need to\nalong with other data points I need to provide this specific model with those\nprovide this specific model with those\nprovide this specific model with those records so that this model will be able\nrecords so that this model will be able\nrecords so that this model will be able to train on this and probably be able to\nto train on this and probably be able to\nto train on this and probably be able to get the output now let's create buckets\nget the output now let's create buckets\nget the output now let's create buckets now based on buckets how the buckets\nnow based on buckets how the buckets\nnow based on buckets how the buckets will be created over here I will take 07\nwill be created over here I will take 07\nwill be created over here I will take 07 until\nuntil\nuntil sorry whatever is the value over here\nsorry whatever is the value over here\nsorry whatever is the value over here normal we value okay so I will start\nnormal we value okay so I will start\nnormal we value okay so I will start creating my buckets buckets basically\ncreating my buckets buckets basically\ncreating my buckets buckets basically from 0 to\nfrom 0 to\nfrom 0 to 07 what did I say now for this decision\n07 what did I say now for this decision\n07 what did I say now for this decision tree or stump I need to provide some\ntree or stump I need to provide some\ntree or stump I need to provide some records so the maximum number of record\nrecords so the maximum number of record\nrecords so the maximum number of record that should be going should be the wrong\nthat should be going should be the wrong\nthat should be going should be the wrong records that should go over here now how\nrecords that should go over here now how\nrecords that should go over here now how do we decide that okay there should be a\ndo we decide that okay there should be a\ndo we decide that okay there should be a way that we should be able to say that\nway that we should be able to say that\nway that we should be able to say that that specific wrong number of Records\nthat specific wrong number of Records\nthat specific wrong number of Records should go to that decision tree so for\nshould go to that decision tree so for\nshould go to that decision tree so for that purpose what we do is that this\nthat purpose what we do is that this\nthat purpose what we do is that this decision tree will randomly create some\ndecision tree will randomly create some\ndecision tree will randomly create some numbers between 0 to 1 randomly create\nnumbers between 0 to 1 randomly create\nnumbers between 0 to 1 randomly create those numbers between 0 to 1 and\nthose numbers between 0 to 1 and\nthose numbers between 0 to 1 and whichever bucket it will come in like 07\nwhichever bucket it will come in like 07\nwhichever bucket it will come in like 07 to 014 014 to 07 basically means 0 2 1\nto 014 014 to 07 basically means 0 2 1\nto 014 014 to 07 basically means 0 2 1 then 0 2 1 2 see how the bucket is\nthen 0 2 1 2 see how the bucket is\nthen 0 2 1 2 see how the bucket is getting cre this value is getting added\ngetting cre this value is getting added\ngetting cre this value is getting added to this so that becomes this bucket 021\nto this so that becomes this bucket 021\nto this so that becomes this bucket 021 +3 537 how much it is it is nothing but\n+3 537 how much it is it is nothing but\n+3 537 how much it is it is nothing but 470 747 then 747\n470 747 then 747\n470 747 then 747 to\nto\nto 751 like this you create all the buckets\n751 like this you create all the buckets\n751 like this you create all the buckets okay you can create all the buckets now\nokay you can create all the buckets now\nokay you can create all the buckets now tell me which record is basically having\ntell me which record is basically having\ntell me which record is basically having the biggest bucket size obviously this\nthe biggest bucket size obviously this\nthe biggest bucket size obviously this record so if I randomly create a number\nrecord so if I randomly create a number\nrecord so if I randomly create a number between 0 to one what is the highest\nbetween 0 to one what is the highest\nbetween 0 to one what is the highest probability that the values will be\nprobability that the values will be\nprobability that the values will be going in so in this particular case most\ngoing in so in this particular case most\ngoing in so in this particular case most of the wrong records will be passed\nof the wrong records will be passed\nof the wrong records will be passed along with the other records obviously\nalong with the other records obviously\nalong with the other records obviously other records there are chances that\nother records there are chances that\nother records there are chances that other records will go to the next\nother records will go to the next\nother records will go to the next decision tree but understand maximum\ndecision tree but understand maximum\ndecision tree but understand maximum number will go with the wrong records\nnumber will go with the wrong records\nnumber will go with the wrong records because the bucket is high over here so\nbecause the bucket is high over here so\nbecause the bucket is high over here so the bucket is high over here so most of\nthe bucket is high over here so most of\nthe bucket is high over here so most of the time this specific record will get\nthe time this specific record will get\nthe time this specific record will get create selected and then it will be gone\ncreate selected and then it will be gone\ncreate selected and then it will be gone to the second tree now suppose I have\nto the second tree now suppose I have\nto the second tree now

you think\nwhat are the possible groups you think definitely you'll be saying K is equal\ndefinitely you'll be saying K is equal\ndefinitely you'll be saying K is equal to 2 So when you say k is equal to two\nto 2 So when you say k is equal to two\nto 2 So when you say k is equal to two that basically means you will be able to\nthat basically means you will be able to\nthat basically means you will be able to get two groups like this and each and\nget two groups like this and each and\nget two groups like this and each and every group will be having a centroid a\nevery group will be having a

you can\nover here so over here here you can definitely say that fine this is two\ndefinitely say that fine this is two\ndefinitely say that fine this is two groups but but how do we come to a\ngroups but but how do we come to a\ngroups but but how do we come to a conclusion that there is only two groups\nconclusion that there is only two groups\nconclusion that there is only two groups okay we cannot just directly say that\nokay we cannot just directly say that\nokay we cannot just directly say that okay we'll try to just by seeing the\nokay we'll try to just by seeing the\nokay we'll try to just by seeing the data because your data will be having a\ndata because your data will be having a\ndata because your data will be having a high dimension data right right now I'm\nhigh dimension data right right now I'm\nhigh dimension data right right now I'm just showing your two Dimension data but\njust showing your two Dimension data but\njust showing your two Dimension data but for a high dimension data definitely\nfor a high dimension data definitely\nfor a high dimension data definitely you'll not be able to see the data\nyou'll not be able to see the data\nyou'll not be able to see the data points how it is plotted so how do you\npoints how it is plotted so how do you\npoints how it is plotted so how do you come to a conclusion that only two\ncome to a conclusion that only

in\nsome steps that we basically perform in\nsome steps that we basically perform in K mins the first step is that we try\nK mins the first step is that we try\nK mins the first step is that we try with different K values we try with\nwith different K values we try with\nwith different K values we try with different K values and which is the\ndifferent K values and which is the\ndifferent K values and which is the suitable K value K is nothing but\nsuitable K value K is nothing but\nsuitable K value K is nothing but centroids okay it is nothing but\ncentroids okay it is nothing but\ncentroids okay it is nothing but centroids we try with different\ncentroids we try with different\ncentroids we try with different different centroids in this particular\ndifferent centroids in this particular\ndifferent centroids in this particular case let's say that I have this\ncase let's say that I have this\ncase let's say that I have this particular data point and I actually\nparticular data point and I actually\nparticular data point and I actually start with k is equal 1 or 2 or 3 any\nstart with k is equal 1 or 2 or 3 any\nstart with k is equal 1 or 2 or 3 any one you want let's say that I'm going to\none you want let's say that I'm going to\none you want let's say that I'm going to start with k is equal 2 how to come up\nstart with k is equal 2 how to come up\nstart with k is equal 2 how to come up with this K is equal to 2 as a perfect\nwith this K is equal to 2 as a perfect\nwith this K is equal to 2 as a perfect value that I'll talk about it we need to\nvalue that I'll talk about it we need to\nvalue that I'll talk about it we need to know there is a concept which is called\nknow there is a concept which is called\nknow there is a concept which is called as within cluster sum of square so when\nas within cluster sum of square so when\nas within cluster sum of square so when we try different K values let's say that\nwe try different K values let's say that\nwe try different K values let's say that for K is equal to 2 what will happen the\nfor K is equal to 2 what will happen the\nfor K is equal to 2 what will happen the first step we select a we try K values\nfirst step we select a we try K values\nfirst step we select a we try K values so let's say that we are considering K\nso let's say that we are considering K\nso let's say that we are considering K is equal to 2 the second step is that we\nis equal to 2 the second step is that we\nis equal to 2 the second step is that we initialize K number of centroids now in\ninitialize K number of centroids now in\ninitialize K number of centroids now in this particular case I know my K value\nthis particular case I know my K value\nthis particular case I know my K value is 2 so we will be initializing randomly\nis 2 so we will be initializing randomly\nis 2 so we will be initializing randomly let's say that K is equal to 2 so what\nlet's say that K is equal to 2 so what\nlet's say that K is equal to 2 so what we can actually do let's say that this\nwe can actually do let's say that this\nwe can actually do let's say that this is this is my one centroid I will I'll\nis this is my one centroid I will I'll\nis this is my one centroid I will I'll put it in another color so this will be\nput it in another color so this will be\nput it in another color so this will be my one centroid and let's say that this\nmy one centroid and let's say that this\nmy one centroid and let's say that this is my another centroid so I have\nis my another centroid so I have\nis my another centroid so I have initialized two centroids randomly in\ninitialized two centroids randomly in\ninitialized two centroids randomly in this space now after this particular\nthis space now after this particular\nthis space now after this particular centroid what we have to do is that\ncentroid what we have to do is that\ncentroid what we have to do is that after initializing this centroid what we\nafter initializing this centroid what we\nafter initializing this centroid what we have to do is that we have to basically\nhave to do is that we have to basically\nhave to do is that we have to basically find out which points are near to the\nfind out which points are near to the\nfind out which points are near to the centroid and which points are near to\ncentroid and which points are near to\ncentroid and which points are near to this centroid now in order to find out\nthis centroid now in order to find out\nthis centroid now in order to find out it is a very easy step we can basically\nit is a very easy step we can basically\nit is a very easy step we can basically use ukan distance to find out the\nuse ukan distance to find out the\nuse ukan distance to find out the distance between the points in an easy\ndistance between the points in an easy\ndistance between the points in an easy way if I really want to show you that\nway if I really want to show you that\nway if I really want to show you that you know like how many points I want to\nyou know like how many points I want to\nyou know like how many points I want to in an easy way what I can do I can\nin an easy way what I can do I can\nin an easy way what I can do I can basically draw a straight line over here\nbasically draw a straight line over here\nbasically draw a straight line over here let's say that I'm drawing a straight\nlet's say that I'm drawing a straight\nlet's say that I'm drawing a straight line over here in another color I can\nline over here in another color I can\nline over here in another color I can draw a straight line and I can also draw\ndraw a straight line and I can also draw\ndraw a straight line and I can also draw one parallel line like this so This\none parallel line like this so This\none parallel line like this so This basically indicates that whichever\nbasically indicates that whichever\nbasically indicates that whichever points you see over here suppose if I\npoints you see over here suppose if I\npoints you see over here suppose if I draw a straight line in between all\ndraw a straight line in between all\ndraw a straight line in between all these points you will be able to see\nthese points you will be able to see\nthese points you will be able to see that let's say that I'm drawing one more\nthat let's say that I'm drawing one more\nthat let's say that I'm drawing one more parallel line\nparallel line\nparallel line which is intersecting together so from\nwhich is intersecting together so from\nwhich is intersecting

do\nPoint so what I'm actually going to do\nPoint so what I'm actually going to do in this particular case all these points\nin this particular case all these points\nin this particular case all these points that you are seeing near the green it\nthat you are seeing near the green it\nthat you are seeing near the green it will become green color so that\nwill become green color so that\nwill become green color so that basically means this is basically nearer\nbasically means this is basically nearer\nbasically means this is basically nearer to this centroid and whichever points\nto this centroid and whichever points\nto this centroid and whichever points are nearer to this particular point that\nare nearer to this particular point that\nare nearer to this particular point that will become red

till here then what\neverybody's clear till here then what will happen is that this summation of\nwill happen is that this summation of\nwill happen is that this summation of all the values then we initialize the K\nall the values then we initialize the K\nall the values then we initialize the K number of centroids that is done then we\nnumber of centroids that is done then we\nnumber of

we have seen that okay these all points belong to this centroid it near\npoints belong to this centroid it near\npoints belong to this centroid it near to this particular centroid so this is\nto this

going to\ngoing to write here we are going to compute the average the reason we\ncompute the average the reason we\ncompute the average the reason we compute the average is that because we\ncompute the average is that because we\ncompute the average is that because we need to update the centroid so compute\nneed to update the centroid so compute\nneed to update the centroid so compute the average to update centroid to update\nthe average to update centroid to update\nthe average to update centroid to update centroids so here you'll be able to see\ncentroids so here you'll be able to see\ncentroids so here you'll be able to see that what I'm actually doing as soon as\nthat what I'm actually doing as soon as\nthat what I'm actually doing as soon as we compute the average this

we are having okay this will probably be\nhaving okay this will probably be\nhaving okay this will probably be distance 1 2 3 this is distance okay 4 5\ndistance 1 2 3 this is distance okay 4 5\ndistance 1 2 3 this is distance okay 4 5 6 like this we have lot of distance so\n6 like this we have lot of distance so\n6 like this we have lot of distance so hierle clustering will first of all find\nhierle clustering will first of all find\nhierle clustering will first of all find out the nearest point and try to compute\nout the nearest point and try to compute\nout the nearest point and try to compute the distance between them and just try\nthe distance between them and just try\nthe distance between them and just try to combine them together into one what\nto combine them together into one what\nto combine them together into one what do we do we basically combine them into\ndo we do we basically combine them into\ndo we do we basically combine them into one group okay so P1 and P2 has been\none group okay so P1 and P2 has been\none group okay so P1 and P2 has been combined let's say then it'll go and\ncombined let's say then it'll go and\ncombined let's say then it'll go and find out the other nearest point so\nfind out the other nearest point so\nfind out the other nearest point so let's say P6 and p7 are near so they are\nlet's say P6 and p7 are near so they are\nlet's say P6 and p7 are near so they are also going to combine into one group so\nalso going to combine into one group so\nalso going to combine into one group so once they combine into one group then we\nonce they combine into one group then we\nonce they combine into one group then we have P6 and p7 which will be obviously L\nhave P6 and p7 which will be obviously L\nhave P6 and p7 which will be obviously L greater than the previous distance and\ngreater than the previous distance and\ngreater than the previous distance and we may get this kind of computation and\nwe may get this kind of computation and\nwe may get this kind of computation and another combination or cluster will form\nanother combination or cluster will form\nanother combination or cluster will form get formed over here then you have seen\nget formed over here then you have seen\nget formed over here then you have seen that okay P3 and P5 are nearer to each\nthat okay P3 and P5 are nearer to each\nthat okay P3 and P5 are nearer to each other so we are going to combine this so\nother so we are going to combine this so\nother so we are going to combine this so I'm going to basically combine P3 and\nI'm going to basically combine P3 and\nI'm going to basically combine P3 and P5 okay and let's say that this distance\nP5 okay and let's say that this distance\nP5 okay and let's say that this distance is greater than the previous one because\nis greater than the previous one because\nis greater than the previous one because we are basically going to sh start with\nwe are basically going to sh start with\nwe are basically going to sh start with the shortest distance and then we are\nthe shortest distance and then we are\nthe shortest distance and then we are going to capture the longest distance\ngoing to capture the longest distance\ngoing to capture the longest distance now this is done now you can see that\nnow this is done now you can see that\nnow this is done now you can see that the next point that is near right to\nthe next point that is near right to\nthe next point that is near right to this particular group is P4 so we are\nthis particular group is P4 so we are\nthis particular group is P4 so we are going to combine this together into one\ngoing to combine this together into one\ngoing to combine this together into one group so once we combine this into one\ngroup so once we combine this into one\ngroup so once we combine this into one group this P4 will get connected like\ngroup this P4 will get connected like\ngroup this P4 will get connected like this let's say it is getting connected\nthis let's say it is getting connected\nthis let's say it is getting connected like this P4 has got connected then what\nlike this P4 has got connected then what\nlike this P4 has got connected then what is the nearest Point whether it is P6 p7\nis the nearest Point whether it is P6 p7\nis the nearest Point whether it is P6 p7 group or P1 P2 obviously here you can\ngroup or P1 P2 obviously here you can\ngroup or P1 P2 obviously here you can see that P1 P2 is there so I am probably\nsee that P1 P2 is there so I am probably\nsee that P1 P2 is there so I am probably going to combine this group together\ngoing to combine this group together\ngoing to combine this group together that basically means P1 P2 let's say I'm\nthat basically means P1 P2 let's say I'm\nthat basically means P1 P2 let's say I'm just going to combine this group group\njust going to combine this group group\njust going to combine this group group together again circle is coming so I\ntogether again circle is coming so I\ntogether again circle is coming so I will make a dot let's say I'm going to\nwill make a dot let's say I'm going to\nwill make a dot let's say I'm going to combine this group together because\ncombine this group together because\ncombine this group together because these are my nearest groups so what will\nthese are my nearest groups so what will\nthese are my nearest groups so what will happen P1 and P2 will get combined to P5\nhappen P1 and P2 will get combined to P5\nhappen P1 and P2 will get combined to P5 sorry P4 P5 this one so I will be\nsorry P4 P5 this one so I will be\nsorry P4 P5 this one so I will be getting another line like this and then\ngetting another line like this and then\ngetting another line like this and then finally you'll be seeing that P6 p7 is\nfinally you'll be seeing that P6 p7 is\nfinally you'll be seeing that P6 p7 is the nearest group to this so this will\nthe nearest group to this so this will\nthe nearest group to this so this will totally get combined and it may look\ntotally get combined and it may look\ntotally get combined and it may look something like this so this will become\nsomething like this so this will become\nsomething like this so this will become a total group like\na total group like\na total group like this so all the groups are combined so\nthis so all the groups are combined so\nthis so all the groups are combined so finally you'll be able to see that there\nfinally you'll be able to see that there\nfinally you'll be able to see that there will be one more line which will get\nwill be one more line which will get\nwill be one more line which will get combined like\ncombined like\ncombined like this this is basically called as\nthis this is basically called as\nthis this is basically called as dendogram dendogram okay which is like\ndendogram dendogram okay which is like\ndendogram dendogram okay which is like bottom root to top now the question\nbottom root to top now the question\nbottom root to top now the question arises is that how do you find that how\narises is that how do you find that how\narises is that how do you find that how many groups should be here how do you\nmany groups should be here how do you\nmany groups should be here how do you find out that how many groups should be\nfind out that how many groups should be\nfind out that how

line pass through it now what this is\npass through it now what this is\npass through it now what this is basically meaning is that I will try to\nbasically meaning is that I will try to\nbasically meaning is that I will try to find out the longest line longest\nfind out the longest line longest\nfind out the longest line longest vertical line in such a way that none of\nvertical line in such a way that none of\nvertical line in such a way that none of the horizontal line passes through it\nthe horizontal line passes through it\nthe horizontal line passes through it what is horizontal line suppose if I\nwhat is horizontal line suppose if I\nwhat is horizontal line suppose if I consider this vertical line This\nconsider this vertical line This\nconsider this vertical line This vertical

be greater than b of I or\nI will be greater than b of I or will B of I will be greater than a ofi\nwill B of I will be greater than a ofi\nwill B of I will be greater than a ofi if I have a good clustering model if I\nif I have a good clustering model if I\nif I have a good clustering model if I have a good clustering model will a of I\nhave a good clustering model will a of I\nhave a good

of I will be greater than a of I in a good model that\nthan a of I in a good model that\nthan a of I in a good model that basically means if I talk about sloid\nbasically means if I talk about sloid\nbasically means if I talk about sloid clustering the values will be between -1\nclustering the values will be between -1\nclustering the values will be between -1 to +1 the more the value is towards +1\nto +1 the more the value is towards +1\nto +1 the more the value is towards +1 that basically means the good the model\nthat basically means the good the model\nthat basically means the good the model is the good the clustering model is the\nis the good the clustering model is the\nis the good the clustering model is the more the values towards negative one\nmore the values towards negative one\nmore the values towards negative one that basically means this condition is\nthat basically means this condition is\nthat basically means this condition is getting applied now what does this\ngetting applied now what does this\ngetting applied now what does this condition basically say that basically\ncondition basically say that basically\ncondition basically say that basically means that this distance is far than the\nmeans that this distance is far than the\nmeans that this distance is far than the cluster distance this is what this\ncluster distance this is what this\ncluster distance this is what this information is getting portrayed and\ninformation is getting portrayed and\ninformation is getting portrayed and this is the importance of CID\nthis is the importance of CID\nthis is the importance of CID clustering finally when we apply the\nclustering finally when we apply the\nclustering finally when we apply the formula of CID clustering you'll be able\nformula of CID clustering you'll be able\nformula of CID clustering you'll be able to see that sloid clustering is nothing\nto see that sloid clustering is nothing\nto see that sloid clustering is nothing but let me rub this everything guys for\nbut let me rub this everything guys for\nbut let me rub this everything guys for you let me just show you what is CID\nyou let me just show you what is CID\nyou let me just show you what is CID clustering CID clustering formula will\nclustering CID clustering formula will\nclustering CID clustering formula will be something like this this B of I so\nbe something like this this B of I so\nbe something like this this B of I so here you have solid clustering this is\nhere you have solid clustering this is\nhere you have solid clustering this is the formula B of I minus a of I Max of a\nthe formula B of I minus a of I Max of a\nthe formula B of I minus a of I Max of a of I comma B of I if C of I is greater\nof I comma B of I if C of I is greater\nof I comma B of I if C of I is greater than one right so by this you will be\nthan one right so by this you will be\nthan one right so by this you will be getting the value between -1 to + 1 and\ngetting the value between -1 to + 1 and\ngetting the value between -1 to + 1 and more the value is towards + one the more\nmore the value is towards + one the more\nmore the value is towards + one the more good your model is more the values\ngood your model is more the values\ngood your model is more the values towards minus1 more bad your model is\ntowards minus1 more bad your model is\ntowards minus1 more bad your model is because if it is towards minus1 that\nbecause if it is towards minus1 that\nbecause if it is towards minus1 that basically means your a of I is obviously\nbasically means your a of I is obviously\nbasically means your a of I is obviously greater than b of I so this is the\ngreater than b of I so this is the\ngreater than b of I so this is the outcome with respect to cot crust string\noutcome with respect to cot crust string\noutcome with respect to cot crust string if s is equal to zero that basically\nif s is equal to zero that basically\nif s is equal to zero that basically means still your model needs to be uh\nmeans still your model needs to be uh\nmeans still your model needs to be uh per basically the clustering needs

topic we have obviously finished up solart\nhave obviously finished up solart\nhave obviously finished up solart clustering over here let's discuss about\nclustering over here let's discuss about\nclustering over here let's discuss about something called as DB\nsomething called as DB\nsomething called as DB scan so for DB scan clustering this is\nscan so for DB scan clustering this is\nscan so for DB scan clustering this is an amazing clustering algorithm we'll\nan amazing clustering algorithm we'll\nan amazing clustering algorithm we'll try to understand how to actually do DB\ntry to understand how to actually do DB\ntry to understand how to actually do DB clustering and probably you'll be able\nclustering and probably you'll be able\nclustering and probably you'll be able to understand a lot of things from this\nto understand a lot of things from this\nto understand a lot of things from this now in DB scan clustering what are the\nnow in DB scan clustering what

something like this right but understand over here what\nthis right but understand over here what\nthis right but understand over here what what problem is basically happening with\nwhat problem is basically happening with\nwhat problem is basically happening with the second clustering this is actually\nthe second clustering this is actually\nthe second clustering this is actually an outliers let's say that let's say one\nan outliers let's say that let's say one\nan outliers let's say that let's say one thing very nicely I will put okay let's\nthing very nicely I will put okay let's\nthing very nicely I will put okay let's say I have one point over here I have\nsay I have one point over here I have\nsay I have one point over here I have one point over here here so if I do\none point

this is an outlier\noutlier even though this is an outlier with the help of K means what I'm\nwith the help of K means what I'm\nwith the help of K means what I'm actually doing I'm actually grouping\nactually doing I'm actually grouping\nactually doing I'm actually grouping this into another group so can we have a\nthis into another group so can we have a\nthis into another group so can we have a scenario wherein a kind of clustering\nscenario wherein a kind of clustering\nscenario wherein a kind of clustering algorithm is there where we can leave\nalgorithm is there where we can

this is\nin this particular algorithm and this is\nin this particular algorithm and this is B basically uh we will be using DB scan\nB basically uh we will be using DB scan\nB basically uh we will be using DB scan to relieve the outlier and this point\nto relieve the outlier and this point\nto relieve the outlier and this point will be called as a noisy Point noisy\nwill be called as a noisy Point

uh one one amazing thing\nthis session uh one one amazing thing that I want to teach you guys because\nthat I want to teach you guys because\nthat I want to teach you guys because many people ask me the definition of\nmany people ask me the definition of\nmany people ask me the definition of bias and variance so guys uh many people\nbias and variance so guys uh many people\nbias and variance so guys uh many people get confused when we talk about bias and\nget confused when we talk about bias and\nget confused when we talk about bias and variance you know because let's say that\nvariance you know because let's say that\nvariance you know because let's say that uh I have a model for the training data\nuh I have a model for the training data\nuh I have a model for the training data set it gives us somewhere around 90%\nset it gives us somewhere around 90%\nset it gives us somewhere around 90% accuracy let's say I'm getting a 90%\naccuracy let's say I'm getting a 90%\naccuracy let's say I'm getting a 90% accuracy for the test data I may\naccuracy for the test data I may\naccuracy for the test data I may probably getting somewhere around 70%\nprobably getting somewhere around 70%\nprobably getting somewhere around 70% accuracy now tell me which scenario is\naccuracy now tell me which scenario is\naccuracy now tell me which scenario is basically this most of the people will\nbasically this most of the people will\nbasically this most of the people will be saying that okay fine it is\nbe saying that okay fine it is\nbe saying that okay fine it is overfitting now when I say overfitting I\noverfitting now when I say overfitting I\noverfitting now when I say overfitting I basically mention overfitting by low\nbasically mention overfitting by low\nbasically mention overfitting by low bias and high\nbias and high\nbias and high variance right so many people get\nvariance right so many people get\nvariance right so many people get confused Krish tell me just the exact\nconfused Krish tell me just the exact\nconfused Krish tell me just the exact definition of bias and variance low bias\ndefinition of bias and variance low bias\ndefinition of bias and variance low bias obviously you are saying that because\nobviously you are saying that because\nobviously you are saying that because the training is performed like the model\nthe training is performed like the model\nthe training is performed like the model is performing well with the help of\nis performing well with the help of\nis performing well with the help of training data set but with respect to\ntraining data set but with respect to\ntraining data set but with respect to the test data set the model is not\nthe test data set the model is not\nthe test data set the model is not performing well with respect to training\nperforming well with respect to training\nperforming well with respect to training data set why do we always say bias and\ndata set why do we always say bias and\ndata

let's\nabout three scenarios over here let's\nabout three scenarios over here let's say this is my model one and this is my\nsay this is my model one and this is my\nsay this is my model one and this is my model\nmodel\nmodel two and this is my model\ntwo and this is my model\ntwo and this is my model three now in this scenario let's\nthree now in this scenario let's\nthree now in this scenario let's consider that my model one has the\nconsider that my model one has the\nconsider that my model one has the training\ntraining\ntraining accuracy of 90% and test accuracy of\naccuracy of 90% and test accuracy of\naccuracy of 90% and test accuracy of 75% similarly I have here as my train\n75% similarly I have here as my train\n75% similarly I have here as my train accuracy of 60% and my test accuracy\naccuracy of 60% and my test accuracy\naccuracy of 60% and my test accuracy of\nof\nof 55% now similarly if I have my train\n55% now similarly if I have my train\n55% now similarly if I have my train accuracy of 90% And my test accuracy of\naccuracy of 90% And my test accuracy of\naccuracy of 90% And my test accuracy of 92% now tell me what what things you\n92% now tell me what what things you\n92% now tell me what what things you will be getting here obviously you can\nwill be getting here obviously you can\nwill be getting here obviously you can directly say that fine your training\ndirectly say that fine your training\ndirectly say that fine your training accuracy is better now you're talking\naccuracy is better now you're talking\naccuracy is better now you're talking about bias so this basically indicates\nabout bias so this basically indicates\nabout bias so this basically indicates that this has low\nthat this has low\nthat this has low bias and since your test accuracy is bad\nbias and since your test accuracy is bad\nbias and since your test accuracy is bad because it is when compared to the train\nbecause it is when compared to the train\nbecause it is when compared to the train accuracy it is less so here you are\naccuracy it is less so here you are\naccuracy it is less so here you are basically going to say high\nbasically going to say

what\ndefinition similarly over here what\ndefinition similarly over here what you'll say high\nyou'll say high\nyou'll say high bias High variance because obviously it\nbias High variance because obviously it\nbias High variance because obviously it is not performing\nis not performing\nis not performing well this is another scenario last the\nwell this is another scenario last the\nwell this is another scenario last the last scenario is that this is the\nlast scenario is that this is the\nlast scenario is that this is the scenario that we want because it is low\nscenario that we want because it is low\nscenario that we want because it is low bias and low variance\nbias and low variance\nbias and low variance okay many many people have basically\nokay many many people have basically\nokay many many people have basically asked me the definition with respect to\nasked me the definition with respect to\nasked me the definition with respect to bias and variance and here I've actually\nbias and variance and here I've actually\nbias and variance and here I've actually discussed and this indicates this gives\ndiscussed and this indicates this gives\ndiscussed and this

does XG boost work suppose salary is less\nXG boost work suppose salary is less\nXG boost work suppose salary is less than or equal to 50 and the credit is\nthan or equal to 50 and the credit is\nthan or equal to 50 and the credit is bad so approval the loan approval will\nbad so approval the loan approval will\nbad so approval the loan approval will be zero that basically means he he or\nbe zero that basically means he he or\nbe zero that basically means he he or she will not get if it is less than or\nshe will not get if it is less than or\nshe will not get if it is less than or equal to 50 if the credit score is good\nequal to 50 if the credit score is good\nequal to 50 if the credit score is good then probably approval will be one if it\nthen probably approval will be one if it\nthen probably approval will be one if it is less than or equal to 50 if it is\nis less than or equal to 50 if it is\nis less than or equal to 50 if it is good\ngood\ngood again then it is going to get one if it\nagain then it is going to get one if it\nagain then it is going to get one if it is greater than\nis greater than\nis greater than 50 and if it is bad then obviously\n50 and if it is bad then obviously\n50 and if it is bad then obviously approval will be\nzero if it is greater than\nzero if it is greater than 50 if it is good we are going to get it\n50 if it is good we are going to get it\n50 if it is good we are going to get it as one if it is greater than\nas one if it is greater than\nas one if it is greater than 50k and probably if it is normal then\n50k and probably if it is

tree\nlet's try to construct the decision tree\nlet's try to construct the decision tree as I said that let's consider that I'm\nas I said that let's consider that I'm\nas I said that let's consider that I'm considering salary feature So based on\nconsidering salary feature So based on\nconsidering salary feature So based on using salary feature what I'm actually\nusing salary feature what I'm actually\nusing salary feature what I'm actually going to do I am going to take this as\ngoing to do I am going to take this as\ngoing to do I am going to take this as my node and I'm going to split this up\nmy node and I'm going to split this up\nmy node and I'm going to split this up and remember whenever we are creating\nand remember whenever we are creating\nand remember whenever we are creating decision Tree in this particular case it\ndecision Tree in this particular case it\ndecision Tree in this particular case it will be a binary decision tree let's say\nwill be a binary decision tree let's say\nwill be a binary decision tree let's say that in salary one is less than or equal\nthat in salary one is less than or equal\nthat in salary one is less than or equal to one is greater than 50 so this two\nto one is greater than 50 so this two\nto one is greater than 50 so this two you obviously have in the case of binary\nyou obviously have in the case of binary\nyou obviously have in the case of binary in case of credit where there are three\nin case of credit where there are three\nin case of credit where there are three categories I'll also show you how that\ncategories I'll also show you how that\ncategories I'll also show you how that further split will happen and how that\nfurther split will happen and how that\nfurther split will happen and how that will get converted into a binary team so\nwill get converted into a binary team so\nwill get converted into a binary team so here you have less than or equal to 50K\nhere you have less than or equal to 50K\nhere you have less than or equal to 50K and greater than 50k now let's go ahead\nand greater than 50k now let's go ahead\nand greater than 50k now let's go ahead and understand how many vales are there\nand understand how many vales are there\nand understand how many vales are there in this salary so if I see before the\nin this salary so if I see before the\nin this salary so if I see before the split you can definitely see that I'm\nsplit you can definitely see that I'm\nsplit you can definitely see that I'm going to use this residual and probably\ngoing to use this residual and probably\ngoing to use this residual and probably train this entire model now if I really\ntrain this entire model now if I really\ntrain this entire model now if I really wanted to find out the residual\nwanted to find out the residual\nwanted to find out the residual initially these are my residuals over\ninitially these are my residuals over\ninitially these are my residuals over here so one resid is -.5 then I have 0.5\nhere so one resid is -.5 then I have 0.5\nhere so one resid is -.5 then I have 0.5 over here then I have .5 then again I\nover here then I have .5 then again I\nover here then I have .5 then again I have -.5 then again I have 0.5 then\nhave -.5 then again I have 0.5 then\nhave -.5 then again I have 0.5 then again I have 0.5 and finally I have\nagain I have 0.5 and finally I have\nagain I have 0.5 and finally I have minus .5 so these are my total residuals\nminus .5 so these are my total residuals\nminus .5 so these are my total residuals that are there suppose if I make this\nthat are there suppose if I make this\nthat are there suppose if I make this split less than or equal to 50 First\nsplit less than or equal to 50 First\nsplit less than or equal to 50 First less than or equal to 50 the residuals\nless than or equal to 50 the residuals\nless than or equal to 50 the residuals what are things are there so here I'm\nwhat are things are there so here I'm\nwhat are things are there so here I'm going to have minus5 then less than or\ngoing to have minus5 then less than or\ngoing to have minus5 then less than or equal to 50 again I'm going to have 05\nequal to 50 again I'm going to have 05\nequal to 50 again I'm going to have 05 then again less than or equal to 50 I'm\nthen again less than or equal to 50 I'm\nthen again less than or equal to 50 I'm going to have 0.5 and less than or equal\ngoing to have 0.5 and less than or equal\ngoing to have 0.5 and less than or equal to again one more 0.5 is there I'm just\nto again one more 0.5 is there I'm just\nto again one more 0.5 is there I'm just going to remove this the last5 which is\ngoing to remove this the last5 which is\ngoing to remove this the last5 which is nothing but Min -.5 so I hope you\nnothing but Min -.5 so I hope you\nnothing but Min -.5 so I hope you understood this split so half of the\nunderstood this split so half of the\nunderstood this split so half of the things came over here the remaining half\nthings came over here the remaining half\nthings came over here the remaining half will be greater than or equal to greater\nwill be greater than or equal to greater\nwill be greater than or equal to greater than 50 so you have one value here one\nthan 50 so you have one value here one\nthan 50 so you have one value here one value here one value here so it will be\nvalue here one value here so it will be\nvalue here one value here so it will be Min -.5 then you have 0.5 and then\nMin -.5 then you have 0.5 and then\nMin -.5 then you have 0.5 and then finally you have 0.5 residuals how do we\nfinally you have 0.5 residuals how do we\nfinally you have 0.5 residuals how do we get it guys see from the base model\nget it guys see from the base model\nget it guys see from the base model which is by default giving 0.5 first my\nwhich is by default giving 0.5 first my\nwhich is by default giving 0.5 first my data goes over here by default\ndata goes over here by default\ndata goes over here by default probability I'm going to get 0.5 so\nprobability I'm going to get 0.5 so\nprobability I'm going to get 0.5 so residual is basically calculated from\nresidual is basically calculated from\nresidual is basically calculated from this probability and approval so this\nthis probability and approval so this\nthis probability and approval so this probability minus approval so if you\nprobability minus approval so if you\nprobability minus approval so if you subtract 0 -.5 sorry I'm just going to\nsubtract 0 -.5 sorry I'm just going to\nsubtract 0 -.5 sorry I'm just going to rub this so if you subtract 0 -.5 you're\nrub this so if you subtract 0 -.5 you're\nrub this so if you subtract 0 -.5 you're going to get -.5 1 -.5 you're going to\ngoing to get -.5 1 -.5 you're going to\ngoing to get -.5 1 -.5 you're going to get .5 1 -.5 you're going to get .5 so\nget .5 1 -.5 you're going to get .5 so\nget .5 1 -.5 you're going to get .5 so everybody I hope is very much clear with\neverybody I hope is very much clear with\neverybody I hope is very much clear with respect to this so this is the first\nrespect to this so this is the first\nrespect to this so this is the first step we constructed a binary tree now in\nstep we constructed a binary tree now in\nstep we constructed a binary tree now in the second step it says calculate the\nthe second step it says calculate the\nthe second step it says calculate the similarity weight now how to calculate\nsimilarity weight now how to calculate\nsimilarity weight now how to calculate the similarity weight similarity weight\nthe similarity weight similarity weight\nthe similarity weight similarity weight formula is sum of residual Square now\nformula is sum of residual Square now\nformula is sum of residual Square now what is residual Square let's say that\nwhat is residual Square let's say that\nwhat is residual Square let's say that I'm going to calculate the the the uh\nI'm going to calculate the the the uh\nI'm going to calculate the the the uh I'm going to calculate for this okay\nI'm going to calculate for this okay\nI'm going to calculate for this okay similarity weight now in this particular\nsimilarity weight now in this particular\nsimilarity weight now in this particular case if I go and calculate my similarity\ncase if I go and calculate my similarity\ncase if I go and calculate my similarity weight it will be summation of residual\nweight it will be summation of residual\nweight it will be summation of residual Square this is my residual values this\nSquare this is my residual values this\nSquare this is my residual values this is my residual Valu so I'm going to do\nis my residual Valu so I'm going to do\nis my residual Valu so I'm going to do the summation of this Square okay this\nthe summation of this Square okay this\nthe summation of this Square okay this value square you can see over here sum\nvalue square you can see over here sum\nvalue square you can see over here sum of residual Square everybody you can see\nof residual Square everybody you can see\nof residual Square everybody you can see sum of of residual squares so what do\nsum of of residual squares so what do\nsum of of residual squares so what do you think sum of residual squares will\nyou think sum of residual squares will\nyou think sum of residual squares will be in this particular case how I have to\nbe in this particular case how I have to\nbe in this particular case how I have to do it I will just take up this all\ndo it I will just take up this all\ndo it I will just take up this all values like\nvalues like\nvalues like -.5\n-.5\n-.5 +5\n+5\n+5 +5 and\n+5 and\n+5 and -.5 whole square right I'm just going to\n-.5 whole square right I'm just going to\n-.5 whole square right I'm just going to do the squaring of this divided by\ndo the squaring of this divided by\ndo the squaring of this divided by understand what it is divided by it is\nunderstand what it is divided by it is\nunderstand what it is divided by it is divided by probability of 1 minus\ndivided by probability of 1 minus\ndivided by probability of 1 minus probability now where do we get this\nprobability now where do we get this\nprobability now where do we get this probability value where do we get this\nprobability value where do we get this\nprobability value where do we get this probability value value we get this\nprobability value value we get this\nprobability value value we get this probability value from our base model\nprobability value from our base model\nprobability value from our base model right so here I'm basically going to say\nright so here I'm basically going to say\nright so here I'm basically going to say that we are going to do the summation of\nthat we are going to do the summation of\nthat we are going to do the summation of probability of 1 minus probability 1\nprobability of 1 minus probability 1\nprobability of 1 minus probability 1 minus probability that basically means\nminus probability that basically means\nminus probability that basically means for each and every point for each and\nfor each and every point for each and\nfor each and every point for each and every Point what is the probability see\nevery Point what is the probability see\nevery Point what is the probability see probability is basically coming from the\nprobability is basically coming from the\nprobability is basically coming from the base model so for each Pro each point\nbase model so for each Pro each point\nbase model so for each Pro each point I'm going to come compute two things one\nI'm going to come compute two things one\nI'm going to come compute two things one is the probability and then 1 minus\nis the probability and then 1 minus\nis the probability and then 1 minus probability and this I'm going to do the\nprobability and this I'm going to do the\nprobability and this I'm going to do the summ\nsumm\nsumm like this I will do it four times 1 -.5\nlike this I will do it four times 1 -.5\nlike this I will do it four times 1 -.5 then .5 * 1 -.5 and finally you'll be\nthen .5 * 1 -.5 and finally you'll be\nthen .5 * 1 -.5 and finally you'll be able to see one more will be there which\nable to see one more will be there which\nable to see one more will be there which is\nis\nis +5 1 -.5 so this will be your total\n+5 1 -.5 so this will be your total\n+5 1 -.5 so this will be your total things with respect to this so I hope\nthings with respect to this so I hope\nthings with respect to this so I hope you have understood till here uh where\nyou have understood till here uh where\nyou have understood till here uh where you are able to understand that what we\nyou are able to understand that what we\nyou are able to understand that what we have done this is summation of uh\nhave done this is summation of uh\nhave done this is summation of uh residual square and this is the\nresidual square and this is the\nresidual square and this is the remaining probability multiplied by 1\nremaining probability multiplied by 1\nremaining probability multiplied by 1 minus probability now tell me what are\nminus probability now tell me what are\nminus probability now tell me what are you able to find out from this if you\nyou able to find out from this if you\nyou able to find out from this if you cancel this and this this and this this\ncancel this and this this and this this\ncancel this and this this and this this value is going to become zero so this\nvalue is going to become zero so this\nvalue is going to become zero so this entire value is going to become Zer\nentire value is going to become Zer\nentire value is going to become Zer because 0 divided by anything is 0er so\nbecause 0 divided by anything is 0er so\nbecause 0 divided by anything is 0er so here I hope everybody is understood what\nhere I hope everybody is understood what\nhere I hope everybody is understood what is the similarity weight of this\nis the similarity weight of this\nis the similarity weight of this specific node if I want to write it is\nspecific node if I want to write it is\nspecific node if I want to write it is nothing but zero now you may be\nnothing but zero now you may be\nnothing but zero now you may be considering where is Lambda\nconsidering where is Lambda\nconsidering where is Lambda value okay we will initially initialize\nvalue okay we will initially initialize\nvalue okay we will initially initialize Lambda by 1 I'll talk about this hyper\nLambda by 1 I'll talk about this hyper\nLambda by 1 I'll talk about this hyper parameter let's consider it as 1 so here\nparameter let's consider it as 1 so here\nparameter let's consider it as 1 so here + 1 or plus 0 let's let's consider\n+ 1 or plus 0 let's let's consider\n+ 1 or plus 0 let's let's consider Lambda value 0 let's say for right now\nLambda value 0 let's say for right now\nLambda value 0 let's say for right now okay I'm just going to make it Lambda is\nokay I'm just going to make it Lambda is\nokay I'm just going to make it Lambda is equal to0 I'm just going to talk about\nequal to0 I'm just going to talk about\nequal to0 I'm just going to talk about it because it is a kind of hyper\nit because it is a kind of hyper\nit because it is a kind of hyper parameter by Z -.5 -.5 +5 +5 if I do the\nparameter by Z -.5 -.5 +5 +5 if I do the\nparameter by Z -.5 -.5 +5 +5 if I do the summation if I do the summation here you\nsummation if I do the summation here you\nsummation if I do the summation here you will be able to see that I'm going to\nwill be able to see that I'm going to\nwill be able to see that I'm going to get zero so this calculation we have\nget zero so this calculation we have\nget zero so this calculation we have done and we have got uh the sumission of\ndone and we have got uh the sumission of\ndone and we have got uh the sumission of weight is equal to Z and let's go ahead\nweight is equal to Z and let's go ahead\nweight is equal to Z and let's go ahead and calculate the sumission of the\nand calculate the sumission of the\nand calculate the sumission of the weight of the next node no no no it's\nweight of the next node no no no it's\nweight of the next node no no no it's not first Square it is whole squar so\nnot first Square it is whole squar so\nnot first Square it is whole squar so here also if I do so it is5 +5 now let's\nhere also if I do so it is5 +5 now let's\nhere also if I do so it is5 +5 now let's do it for this if I want to find out the\ndo it for this if I want to find out the\ndo it for this if I want to find out the similarity weight again see I'm going to\nsimilarity weight again see I'm going to\nsimilarity weight again see I'm going to repeat it .5 +5 whole squ and since\nrepeat it .5 +5 whole squ and since\nrepeat it .5 +5 whole squ and since there are three points so I'm going to\nthere are three points so I'm going to\nthere are three points so I'm going to basically use probability 1 minus\nbasically use probability 1 minus\nbasically use probability 1 minus probability for one point then plus\nprobability for one point then plus\nprobability for one point then plus probability 1 minus probability second\nprobability 1 minus probability second\nprobability 1 minus probability second point and then probability and 1 minus\npoint and then probability and 1 minus\npoint and then probability and 1 minus probability for the third point and\nprobability for the third point and\nprobability for the third point and Lambda is zero so I'm not going to write\nLambda is zero so I'm not going to write\nLambda is zero so I'm not going to write anything now go let's go and do the\nanything now go let's go and do the\nanything now go let's go and do the calculation for this node so - 5 - 5 it\ncalculation for this node so - 5 - 5 it\ncalculation for this node so - 5 - 5 it becomes zero then .5 whole square right\nbecomes zero then .5 whole square right\nbecomes zero then .5 whole square right so here I'm going to get 0.25 here if\nso here I'm going to get 0.25 here if\nso here I'm going to get 0.25 here if you do the calculation here you are\nyou do the calculation here you are\nyou do the calculation here you are going to get 75 so this value is going\ngoing to get 75 so this value is going\ngoing to get 75 so this value is going to be 1x3 and which is nothing at33 so\nto be 1x3 and which is nothing at33 so\nto be 1x3 and which is nothing at33 so the similarity weight for this node for\nthe similarity weight for this node for\nthe similarity weight for this node for this node\nthis node\nthis node is33 so here you can see probability of\nis33 so here you can see probability of\nis33 so here you can see probability of multiplied by 1 minus\nmultiplied by 1 minus\nmultiplied by 1 minus probability okay now the next step that\nprobability okay now the next step that\nprobability okay now the next step that we do is that calculate the information\nwe do is that calculate the information\nwe do is that calculate the information gain now you know how to calculate the\ngain now you know how to calculate the\ngain now you know how to calculate the information gain but before that let's\ninformation

go ahead and\nthis root node also go ahead and\nthis root node also go ahead and calculate the similarity weight of\ncalculate the similarity weight of\ncalculate the similarity weight of this okay they\nthis okay they\nthis okay they why the base model probability is5\nwhy the base model probability is5\nwhy the base model probability is5 because it is just understand that it is\nbecause it is

chish here are\nyou may be considering chish here are\nyou may be considering chish here are only three categories how we are going\nonly three categories how we are going\nonly three categories how we are going to basically do this particular split\nto basically do this particular split\nto basically do this particular split right because we don't know how to do\nright because we don't know how

case I will get similarity weight as I hope everybody I'm getting\nweight as I hope everybody I'm getting\nweight as I hope everybody I'm getting it as one now what about this similarity\nit as one now what about this similarity\nit as one now what about this similarity weight if you want to compute it is\nweight if you want to compute it is\nweight if you want to compute it is again very very simple this and this\nagain very very simple this and this\nagain very very simple this and this will get cancelled then again it will be\nwill get cancelled then again it will be\nwill get cancelled then again it will be 025 divided by um if I say one like this\n025 divided by um if I say one like this\n025 divided by um if I say one like this .25 then again it will be 75 then this\n.25 then again it will be 75 then this\n.25 then again it will be 75 then this will also be 1 by3 that is nothing but\nwill also be 1 by3 that is nothing but\nwill also be 1 by3 that is nothing but 33 so similarity weight will\n33 so similarity weight will\n33 so similarity weight will be33 then again I have to calculate the\nbe33 then again I have to calculate the\nbe33 then again I have to calculate the information gain of this node what I\ninformation gain of this node what I\ninformation gain of this node what I will do I will add this up see 1\nwill do I will add this up see 1\nwill do I will add this up see 1 +33 I'll add like 1\n+33 I'll add like 1\n+33 I'll add like 1 +33 minus 0 why zero because the\n+33 minus 0 why zero because the\n+33 minus 0 why zero because the information gain the similarity weight\ninformation gain the similarity weight\ninformation gain the similarity weight of this uh the up one is basically 0\nof this uh the up one is basically 0\nof this uh the up one is basically 0 right for this particular credit node\nright for this particular credit node\nright for this particular credit node similarity weight is zero so 1\nsimilarity weight is zero so 1\nsimilarity weight is zero so 1 +33 minus 0 this will be 1.33 so like\n+33 minus 0 this will be 1.33 so like\n+33 minus 0 this will be 1.33 so like this further split will again happen\nthis further split will again happen\nthis further split will again happen over here with different different node\nover here with different different node\nover here with different different node and we will only be getting a binary\nand we will only be getting a binary\nand we will only be getting a binary split but we will be comparing based on\nsplit but we will be comparing based on\nsplit but we will be comparing based on Information Gain which one is coming\nInformation Gain which one is coming\nInformation Gain which one is coming good now let's say that I have created\ngood now let's say that I

everybody what I'm going to do let's\nsee everybody what I'm going to do let's consider the inferencing part let's say\nconsider the inferencing part let's say\nconsider the inferencing part let's say this record is going to go how we are\nthis record is going to go how we are\nthis record is going to go how we are going to calculate the output so this\ngoing to calculate the output so this\ngoing to calculate the output so this first of all went to this base model now\nfirst of all went to this base model now\nfirst of all went to this base model now let's go ahead and see how the\nlet's go ahead and see how the\nlet's go ahead and see how the inferencing will happen suppose This\ninferencing will happen suppose This\ninferencing will happen suppose This Record is going right so first of all\nRecord is going right so first of all\nRecord is going right so first of all this record will go to this base model\nthis record will go to this base model\nthis record will go to this base model the base model is giving the probability\nthe base model is giving the probability\nthe base model is giving the probability as 0.5 so the first base model is\nas 0.5 so the first base model is\nas 0.5 so the first base model is basically giving 0.5 now base based on\nbasically giving 0.5 now base based on\nbasically giving 0.5 now base based on this 05 how do we calculate the real\nthis 05 how do we calculate the real\nthis 05 how do we calculate the real probability how do we calculate the real\nprobability how do we calculate the real\nprobability how do we calculate the real probability in this okay so we apply\nprobability in this okay so we apply\nprobability in this okay so we apply something called as logs so we basically\nsomething called as logs so we basically\nsomething called as logs so we basically say log of P / 1us P so this is the\nsay log of P / 1us P so this is the\nsay log of P / 1us P so this is the formula we basically apply in only the\nformula we basically apply in only the\nformula we basically apply in only the case of base model so if we try to see\ncase of base model so if we try to see\ncase of base model so if we try to see this it is nothing but log\nthis it is nothing but log\nthis it is nothing but log of5 / .5 which is nothing but zero log\nof5 / .5 which is nothing but zero log\nof5 / .5 which is nothing but zero log of one is nothing but zero so in the\nof one is nothing but zero so in the\nof one is nothing but zero so in the first case whenever any record goes I\nfirst case whenever any record goes I\nfirst case whenever any record goes I will be getting the zero value over here\nwill be getting the zero value over here\nwill be getting the zero value over here okay zero value over here then plus why\nokay zero value

binary decision Tre whatever value I'm getting from this I'm\nwhatever value I'm getting from this I'm\nwhatever value I'm getting from this I'm actually adding that up and now it will\nactually adding that up and now it will\nactually adding that up and now it will go over here now when it goes over here\ngo over here now when it goes over here\ngo over here now when it goes over here first

then this is bad it'll go and\nhere then this is bad it'll go and follow here so here I can see that the\nfollow here so here I can see that the\nfollow here so here I can see that the similarity weight is one now the\nsimilarity weight is one now the\nsimilarity weight is one now the similarity weight is basically one in\nsimilarity weight is basically one in\nsimilarity weight is basically one in this case so what we do in the case of\nthis case so what we do in the case of\nthis case so what we do in the case of this we pass it to a learning rate\nthis we pass it to a learning rate\nthis we pass it to a learning rate parameter so this specifically is my\nparameter so this specifically is my\nparameter so this specifically is my learning rate multiplied by 1 one\nlearning

to get all the\nhere I'm actually going to get all the\nhere I'm actually going to get all the other values - 9 1 9 11 now what we are\nother values - 9 1 9 11 now what we are\nother values - 9 1 9 11 now what we are going to do after this is that calculate\ngoing to do after this is that calculate\ngoing to do after this is that calculate the similarity weight now here the\nthe similarity weight now here the\nthe similarity weight now here the similarity weight will little bit the\nsimilarity weight will little bit the\nsimilarity weight will little bit the formula will change with respect to\nformula will change with respect to\nformula will change with respect to regression so similarity weight is\nregression so similarity weight is\nregression so similarity weight is nothing but summation of residual\nnothing but summation of residual\nnothing but summation of residual squares divided by number of residuals\nsquares divided by number of residuals\nsquares divided by number of residuals plus Lambda again here we are going to\nplus Lambda again here we are going to\nplus Lambda again here we are going to consider Lambda is zero because this is\nconsider Lambda is zero because this is\nconsider Lambda is zero because this is a hyper parameter tuning more the value\na hyper parameter tuning more the value\na hyper parameter tuning more the value of Lambda that basically means more more\nof Lambda that basically means more more\nof Lambda that basically means more more we are penalizing with respect to the\nwe are penalizing with respect to the\nwe are penalizing with respect to the residuals so this will be the formula\nresiduals so this will be the formula\nresiduals so this will be the formula that we are going to apply okay so let's\nthat we are going to apply okay so let's\nthat we are going to apply okay so let's see for the first number that that we\nsee for the first number that that we\nsee for the first number that that we want to apply so how this will get\nwant to apply so how this will get\nwant to apply so how this will get applied again I'm going to write this\napplied again I'm going to write this\napplied again I'm going to write this formula here it'll be better let's say\nformula here it'll be better let's say\nformula here it'll be better let's say here similarity weight is equal to\nhere similarity weight is equal to\nhere similarity weight is equal to summation of residual square and here\nsummation of residual square and here\nsummation of residual square and here you have number of residuals plus Lambda\nyou have number of residuals plus Lambda\nyou have number of residuals plus Lambda see previously we were using probability\nsee previously we were using probability\nsee previously we were using

if you want to calculate the similarity weight of this this will\nsimilarity weight of this this will\nsimilarity weight of this this will become 121 divided by number of residual\nbecome 121 divided

what will\nAlpha is equal to 1 then what will\nAlpha is equal to 1 then what will happen if you take Alpha is equal to 1\nhappen if you take Alpha is equal to 1\nhappen if you take Alpha is equal to 1 just think over here what will what may\njust think over here what will what may\njust think over here what will what may happen we may directly penalize the\nhappen we may directly penalize the\nhappen we may directly penalize the similarity weight right by just adding\nsimilarity weight right by just adding\nsimilarity weight right by just adding one okay so let's do that also suppose I\none okay so let's do that also suppose I\none okay so let's do that also suppose I say I'm going to take Alpha is equal to\nsay I'm going to take Alpha is equal to\nsay I'm going to take Alpha is

Direction\nsee it is in the negative Direction\nsee it is in the negative Direction let's say that this slope is minus one\nlet's say that this slope is minus one\nlet's say that this slope is minus one I'm just trying to prove that this slope\nI'm just trying to prove that this slope\nI'm just trying to prove that this slope is negative value let's consider this\nis negative value let's consider this\nis negative value let's consider this now suppose this is one of my point - 4a\nnow suppose this is one of my point - 4a\nnow suppose this is one of my point - 4a 0 and obviously this particular equation\n0 and obviously this particular equation\n0 and obviously this particular equation is given by this particular line is\nis given by this particular line is\nis given by this particular line is given by this equation now if I really\ngiven by this equation now if I really\ngiven by this equation now if I really want to find out the Y value let's say\nwant to find out the Y value let's say\nwant to find out the Y value let's say that this is my\nthat this is my\nthat this is my X1 this is my X1 and this is my X2 let's\nX1 this is my X1 and this is my X2 let's\nX1 this is my X1 and this is my X2 let's say that\nsay that\nsay that I want to find out I want to find out\nI want to find out I want to find out\nI want to find out I want to find out this W transpose x + b the Y value based\nthis W transpose x + b the Y value based\nthis W transpose x + b the Y value based on this line if I want to compute the y-\non this line if I want to compute the y-\non this line if I want to compute the y- value based on this line how will I\nvalue based on this line how will I\nvalue based on this line how will I compute W transpose X basically means\ncompute W transpose X basically means\ncompute W transpose X basically means what w value what all things will be\nwhat w value what all things will be\nwhat w value what all things will be there one value is B right B is\nthere one value is B right B is\nthere one value is B right B is intercept right now intercept is passing\nintercept right now intercept is passing\nintercept right now intercept is passing from origin can I say my B will be zero\nfrom origin can I say my B will be zero\nfrom origin can I say my B will be zero obviously I can assume that b will be\nobviously I can assume that b will be\nobviously I can assume that b will be zero now in this particular case if I\nzero now in this particular case if I\nzero now in this particular case if I talk about w w in this case is minus one\ntalk about w w in this case is minus one\ntalk about w w in this case is minus one which I have initialized over here so if\nwhich I have initialized over here so if\nwhich I have initialized over here so if I want to do this matrix multiplication\nI want to do this matrix multiplication\nI want to do this matrix multiplication it will be W transpose can be written as\nit will be W transpose can be written as\nit will be W transpose can be written as like this and this x value can be\nlike this and this x value can be\nlike this and this x value can be written as -4 comma - 4 and 0 -4 and 0\nwritten as -4 comma - 4 and 0 -4 and 0\nwritten as -4 comma - 4 and 0 -4 and 0 right so I can basically write like this\nright so I can basically write like this\nright so I can basically write like this now if I do this multiplication what\nnow if I do this multiplication what\nnow if I do this multiplication what will my value I get I will basically get\nwill my value I get I will basically get\nwill my value I get I will basically get four right so this is a positive\nfour right so this is a positive\nfour right so this is a positive value this is a positive value Now\nvalue this is a positive value Now\nvalue this is a positive value Now understand since this is a positive\nunderstand since this is a positive\nunderstand since this is a positive value any points that are below this\nvalue any points that are below this\nvalue any points that are below this line any points that I consider below\nline any points that I consider below\nline any points that I consider below this line and if I try to calculate the\nthis line and if I try to calculate the\nthis line and if I try to calculate the Y can I say that it will always be\nY can I say that it will always be\nY can I say that it will always be positive yes or no similarly if I could\npositive yes or no similarly if I could\npositive yes or no similarly if I could probably consider one point over here as\nprobably consider one point over here as\nprobably consider one point over here as 4A 4A 4 now tell me in this 4A 4 if I\n4A 4A 4 now tell me in this 4A 4 if I\n4A 4A 4 now tell me in this 4A 4 if I calculate the Y value what will you get\ncalculate the Y value what will you get\ncalculate the Y value what will you get whether you'll get a positive value or a\nwhether you'll get a positive value or a\nwhether you'll get a positive value or a negative value if I try to calculate the\nnegative value if I try to calculate the\nnegative value if I try to calculate the Y value in this case because here only\nY value in this case because here only\nY value in this case because here only positive values will'll be getting right\npositive values will'll be getting right\npositive values will'll be getting right so if I calculate the Y value will the Y\nso if I calculate the Y value will the Y\nso if I calculate the Y value will the Y value be negative or positive just try\nvalue be negative or positive just try\nvalue be negative or positive just try to calculate how do you calculate again\nto calculate how do you calculate again\nto calculate how do you calculate again I will use y equation this time again my\nI will use y equation this time again my\nI will use y equation this time again my slope is minus1 my intercept is zero and\nslope is minus1 my intercept is zero and\nslope is minus1 my intercept is zero and here I will have 4 comma\nhere I will have 4 comma\nhere I will have 4 comma 4 now here Min\n4 now here Min\n4 now here Min -4 and then this is + 0 this will be Min\n-4 and then this is + 0 this will be Min\n-4 and then this is + 0 this will be Min -4 right so this will be a negative\n-4 right so this will be a negative\n-4 right so this will be a negative value negative value guys negative see -\nvalue negative value guys negative see -\nvalue negative value guys negative see - 4 + 0 negative so any point that I will\n4 + 0 negative so any point that I will\n4 + 0 negative so any point that I will probably have in top of this any\nprobably have in top of this any\nprobably have in top of this any points Above This Plane right and if I\npoints Above This Plane right and if I\npoints Above This Plane right and if I try to calculate the Y value it will\ntry to calculate the Y value it will\ntry to calculate the Y value it will always be negative so what two things\nalways be negative so what two things\nalways be negative so what two things you are able to get positive and\nyou are able to get positive and\nyou are able to get positive and negative so you can consider this\nnegative so you can consider this\nnegative so you can consider this entirely one category this another\nentirely one category this another\nentirely one category this another category at least these two things you\ncategory at least these two things you\ncategory at least these two things you can basically\ncan basically\ncan basically consider guys I hope everybody is able\nconsider guys I hope everybody is able\nconsider guys I hope everybody is able to understand this so this will be my\nto understand this so this will be my\nto understand this so this will be my one\none\none category and this will be my another\ncategory and this will be my another\ncategory and this will be my another category obviously so that basically\ncategory obviously so that basically\ncategory obviously so that basically means I can definitely use a plane and\nmeans I can definitely use a plane and\nmeans I can definitely use a plane and split this point I hope everybody is\nsplit this point I hope everybody is\nsplit this point I hope everybody is able to understand now let's go ahead\nable to understand now let's go ahead\nable to understand now let's go ahead and let's see how this marginal plane\nand let's see how this marginal plane\nand let's see how this marginal plane will get created and what is the cost\nwill get created and what is the cost\nwill get

cost function in making sure that\nthe cost function in making sure that the marginal plane will definitely work\nthe marginal plane will definitely work\nthe marginal plane will definitely work right it becomes difficult right so\nright it becomes difficult right so\nright it becomes difficult right so suppose let's consider an\nsuppose let's consider an\nsuppose let's consider an example suppose I say that this is my\nexample suppose I say that this is my\nexample suppose I say that this is my lines let's say uh I want to basically\nlines let's say uh I want to basically\nlines let's say uh I

here let's\nother points I have somewhere here let's\nother points I have somewhere here let's consider I am just using directly good\nconsider I am just using directly good\nconsider I am just using

try to talk about it\nokay because I will try to talk about it what I'm actually trying to prove so\nwhat I'm actually trying to prove so\nwhat I'm actually trying to prove so obviously this is my best fit line that\nobviously this is my best fit line that\nobviously this is my best fit line that splits and apart from that what I will\nsplits and apart from that what I will\nsplits and apart from that what I will do is that I'll also create a marginal\ndo is that I'll also create a marginal\ndo is that I'll also create a marginal points so in order to create the\npoints so in order to create the\npoints so in order to create the marginal point I may use some different\nmarginal point I may use some different\nmarginal point I may use some different color let's see which color this

remember it will be to the nearest point over here and\nbe to the nearest point over here and\nbe to the nearest point over here and basically we will construct like like\nbasically we will construct

mentioned at w transpose x + B = 0 right I can\nat w transpose x + B = 0 right I can\nat w transpose x + B = 0 right I can definitely say this because ax + b y + C\ndefinitely say this because ax + b y + C\ndefinitely say this because ax + b y + C is equal to 0 so this I can also write\nis equal to 0 so this I can also write\nis equal to 0 so this I can also write it as W transpose x equal to 0 sorry\nit as W transpose x equal to 0 sorry\nit as W transpose x equal to 0 sorry plus b plus b equal to 0 so both are\nplus b plus b equal to 0 so both are\nplus b plus b equal to 0 so both are same okay this I don't have to prove it\nsame okay this I don't have to prove it\nsame okay this I don't have to prove it I hope everybody's clear with this now\nI hope everybody's clear with this now\nI

that our major\nsay that our major\nsay that our major aim our major aim is that if I multiply\naim our major aim is that if I multiply\naim our major aim is that if I multiply y i multiplied by W transpose X of I + B\ny i multiplied by W transpose X of I + B\ny i multiplied by W transpose X of I + B If I multiply this two this will always\nIf I multiply this two this will always\nIf I multiply this two this will always be able greater than or equal to 1 for\nbe able greater than or equal to 1 for\nbe able greater than or equal to 1 for correct points right for correct points\ncorrect points right for correct points\ncorrect points right for correct points because understand if it is minus one if\nbecause understand if it is minus one if\nbecause understand if it is minus one if I'm

will\ncorrect Point minus into minus will obviously be greater than or equal to\nobviously be greater than or equal to\nobviously be greater than or equal to one only right similarly for this it\none only right similarly for this it\none only right similarly for this it will be greater than 1 so I can also\nwill be greater than 1 so I can also\nwill be greater than 1 so I can also definitely say that my major M If I\ndefinitely say that my major M If I\ndefinitely say that my major M If I multiply y of I with this it will be\nmultiply y of I with this it will be\nmultiply y of I with this it will be always greater than or equal to + 1 U\nalways greater than or equal to + 1 U\nalways greater than or equal to + 1 U which is definitely saying that it will\nwhich is definitely saying that it will\nwhich is definitely saying that it will be a positive value so this is just a\nbe a positive value so this is just a\nbe a positive value so this is just a representation guys but understand what\nrepresentation guys but understand what\nrepresentation guys but understand what is the minimized cost function this is\nis the minimized cost function this is\nis the minimized cost function this is my minimized cost function maximized\nmy minimized cost function maximized\nmy minimized cost function maximized cost function now I'm going to again\ncost function now I'm going to again\ncost function now I'm going to again write it down\nwrite it down\nwrite it down maximize W comma B maximize W comma b 2\nmaximize W comma B maximize W comma b 2\nmaximize W comma B maximize W comma b 2 by magnitude of w I can also write\nby magnitude of w I can also write\nby magnitude of w I can also write something like this minimize W comma B\nsomething like this minimize W comma B\nsomething like this minimize W comma B and I can just inverse this which looks\nand I can just inverse this which looks\nand I can just inverse this which looks like this are these both are same or not\nlike this are these both are same or not\nlike this are these both are same or not because always understand in machine\nbecause always understand in machine\nbecause always understand in machine learning algorithm why do we write\nlearning algorithm why do we write\nlearning algorithm why do we write minimize things because we are trying to\nminimize things because we are trying to\nminimize things because we are trying to minimize something okay both are\nminimize something okay both are\nminimize something okay both are equivalent these both are equivalent and\nequivalent these both are equivalent and\nequivalent these both are equivalent and why we specifically write minimization\nwhy we specifically write minimization\nwhy we specifically write minimization because in the back propagation when we\nbecause in the back propagation when we\nbecause in the back propagation when we we are continuously updating the weights\nwe are continuously updating the weights\nwe are continuously updating the weights of w and B so we can definitely write\nof w and B so we can definitely write\nof w and B so we can definitely write like this so here my main target is to\nlike this so here my main target is to\nlike this so here my main target is to minimize this particular value by\nminimize this particular value by\nminimize this particular value by changing W and B and I will

development project going on in the market\nthat would be requiring machine learning co-developers\non their team.\nIt's expected that these project will generate a revenue\nof around three point nine trillion dollar,\nisn't it cute so looking at the huge?\nUpcoming demand of machine learning around the world.\nWe guys at Eureka have come up\nand designed a well-structured machine learning full course\nfor you guys.\nBut before we actually drill down over there,\nlet me just introduce myself.\nHello all I am Atul from Edureka.\nAnd today I'll be guiding you\nthrough this entire machine learning course.\nWell, this course has been designed in a way\nthat you get the most out of it.\nSo we'll slowly and gradually start\nwith a beginner level and then move towards the advanced topic.\nSo without delaying any further,\nlet's start with the agenda of today's Action\non machine learning course has been segregated\ninto six different module will start our first module\nwith introduction to machine learning here.\nWe'll discuss things.\nLike what exactly is machine learning\nhow it differs from artificial intelligence and the planning\nwhat is various types or dead space

inferential statistics to Bob.\nRarity Theory and so\non our third module is unsupervised learning.\nWell supervised learning is one of a type of machine learning\nwhich focuses mainly\non regression and classification type of problem.\nIt deals with label data sets and the algorithm\nwhich are a part of it are linear regression\nlogistic regression Napier's random Forest decision tree\nand so on.\nOur fourth module is on unsupervised learning.\nWell this module focuses mainly on dealing\nwith unlabeled data sets\nand the algorithm which are a part.\nOffered or k-means algorithm\nand a

end.\nIt's all about to make you industry ready.\nOkay.\nSo here we are going to discuss about three different projects\nwhich are based on supervised learning\nand unsupervised learning\nand reinforcement learning finally in the end.\nI tell you about some of the skills\nthat you need to become a machine learnings and Jean.\nNia okay, and also I am discussing about some\nof the important questions\nthat are asked in a machine-learning interview fine\nwith this we come to the end of this agenda\nbefore you move ahead\ndon't forget to subscribe to a dareka and press\nthe Bell icon to never miss any update from us.\nHello everyone.\nThis is a toll from Eureka\nand welcome to today's session on what is machine learning.\nAs you know,\nwe are living in a world of humans\nand machines humans have been evolving\nand learning from the past experience since millions\nof years on the other hand the era of machines\nand robots have just begun in today's world.\nThese machines are the rewards are\nlike they need to be program\nbefore they actually follow your instructions.\nBut what if the machine started to learn\non their own and this is\nwhere machine learning comes\ninto picture machine learning is the core\nof many futuristic technology advancement in our world.\nAnd today you can see various examples\nor implementation of machine learning around us\nsuch as Tesla's self-driving car Apple Siri, Sophia.\nI do bot and many more are there.\nSo what exactly is machine learning?\nWell Machine learning is a subfield\nof artificial intelligence\nthat focuses on the design of system\nthat can learn from and make decisions\nand predictions based on the experience\nwhich is data in the case of machines machine learning\nenables computer to act\nand make data-driven decisions rather than\nBeing explicitly programmed\nto carry out a certain task these programs\nare designed to learn\nand improve over time\nwhen exposed to new data.\nLet's move on and discuss one\nof the biggest confusion of the people in the world.\nThey think that all the three of them\nthe AI the machine learning and the Deep learning all are same,\nyou know, what they are wrong.\nLet me clarify things\nfor you artificial intelligence is a broader concept\nof machines being able to carry out tasks in a smarter way.\nIt covers anything which enables the computer to be.\nHave like humans think of a famous Turing test to determine\nwhether a computer is capable of thinking\nlike a human being or not.\nIf you are talking to Siri on your phone\nand you get an answer you're already very close to it.\nSo this was about the artificial intelligence now coming\nto the machine learning part.\nSo as I already said machine learning is a subset\nor a current application of AI it is based on the idea\nthat we should be able to give machine the access\nto data and let them learn from done cells.\nIt's a subset of artificial intelligence.\nIs that deals\nwith the extraction of pattern from data set?\nThis means that the machine can not only find the rules\nfor optimal Behavior,\nbut also can adapt to the changes in the world many\nof the algorithms involved have been known\nfor decades centuries even thanks to the advances\nin the computer science and parallel Computing.\nThey can now scale up to massive data volumes.\nSo this was about the machine learning part now coming over\nto deep learning deep learning is a subset of machine learning\nwhere similar machine learning.\nTamar used to train deep neural network.\nSo as to achieve better accuracy in those cases\nwhere former was not performing up to the mark, right?\nI hope now you understood that machine learning Ai\nand deep learning all three are different.\nOkay moving on ahead.\nLet's see in general how a machine learning work.\nOne of the approaches is\nwhere the machine learning algorithm is strained\nusing a labeled or unlabeled training data\nset to produce a model\nnew input data is introduced to the machine learning algorithm\nand it make prediction based on the model.\nThe prediction is evaluated for accuracy.\nAnd if the accuracy is acceptable the machine\nlearning algorithm is deployed.\nNow if the accuracy is not acceptable\nthe machine learning algorithm is strained again,\nand again with an argument a training data set.\nThis was just in high-level example\nas they are many more factor and other steps involved in it.\nNow, let's move on and subcategorize the Machine\nlearning into three different types the supervised learning\nand unsupervised learning and reinforcement\nlearning and let's see what each of them are how they work.\nWork and how each\nof them is used in the field of banking Healthcare retail\nand other domains.\nDon't worry.\nI'll make sure\nthat I use enough examples and implementation of all three\nof them to give you a proper understanding of it.\nSo starting with supervised learning.\nWhat is it?\nSo let's see a mathematical definition\nof supervised learning supervised learning is\nwhere you have input variables X and an output variable Y\nand you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function\nfrom the input to the output.\nThat is y Affects\nthe goal is to approximate the mapping function.\nSo well that whenever you have a new input data\nX you could predict the output variable.\nThat is why for that data, right?\nI think this was confusing for you.\nLet me simplify the definition of supervised learning\nso we can rephrase the understanding\nof the mathematical definition as a machine learning method\nwhere each instances of a training data set is composed\nof different input attribute\nand an expected output the input attributes\nof a training data set can be of any End of data it can be\na pixel of the image.\nIt can be a value of a data base row\nor it can even be an audio frequency histogram right\nfor each input instance\nand expected output values\nAssociated value can be discreet representing a category\nor can be a real or continuous value in either case.\nThe algorithm learns the input pattern\nthat generate the expected output now\nonce the algorithm is strain,\nit can be used to predict the correct output\nof a never seen input.\nYou can see I image on your screen right\nin this image.\nAnd see that we are feeding raw inputs as image of Apple\nto the algorithm as a part of the algorithm.\nWe have a supervisor who keeps on correcting\nthe machine or who keeps on training the machine.\nIt keeps on telling him that yes, it is a Apple.\nNo, it is not an apple things like that.\nSo this process keeps\non repeating until we get a final train model.\nOnce the model is ready.\nIt can easily predict the correct output\nof a never seen input in this slide.\nYou can see\nthat we are giving an image of a green apple to the machine\nand the Machine can easily identify it as yes,\nit is an apple and it is giving the correct result right?\nLet me make things more clearer to you.\nLet's discuss another example of it.\nSo in this Slide,\nthe image shows an example\nof a supervised learning process used to produce a model\nwhich is capable of recognizing the ducks in the image.\nThe training data set is composed of labeled picture\nof ducks and non Ducks.\nThe result of supervised learning process is\na predictor model\nwhich is capable of associating a label duck.\nOr not duck to the new image presented to the model.\nNow one strain,\nthe resulting predictive model can be deployed\nto the production environment.\nYou can see a mobile app.\nFor example once deployed it is ready to recognize\nthe new pictures right now.\nYou might be wondering why this category\nof machine learning is named as supervised learning.\nWell, it is called a supervised learning\nbecause the process of an algorithm learning\nfrom the training data set can be thought\nof as a teacher supervising the learning process\nif we know the correct answers.\nI will go Rhythm iteratively makes\nwhile predicting on the training data\nand is corrected by the teacher the learning stops\nwhen the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.\nNow, let's move on and see some\nof the popular supervised learning algorithm.\nSo we have linear regression random forest\nand support Vector machines.\nThese are just for your information.\nWe will discuss about these algorithms\nin our next video.\nNow, let's see some of the popular use cases\nof supervised learning\nso we have Donna codon or any other speech\nAutomation in your mobile phone trains using your voice\nand one strain it start working based on the training.\nThis is an application of supervised learning suppose.\nYou are telling OK Google call Sam\nor you say Hey Siri call Sam you get an answer to it\nand action is performed\nand automatically a call goes to Sam.\nSo these are just an example\nof supervised learning next comes the weather up\nbased on some of the prior knowledge\nlike when it is sunny the temperature is high.\nFire when it is cloudy humidity is higher any kind of that they\npredict the parameters for a given time.\nSo this is also an example of supervised learning\nas we are feeding the data to the machine and telling\nthat whenever it is sunny.\nThe temperature should be higher whenever it is cloudy.\nThe humidity should be higher.\nSo it's an example of supervised learning.\nAnother example is biometric attendance\nwhere you train the machine and after couple of inputs\nof your biometric identity beat your thumb your iris\nor yellow or anything\nonce trained Machine gun validate your future input\nand can identify you next comes in the field of banking sector\nin banking sector\nsupervised learning is used to predict the credit worthiness\nof a credit card holder\nby building a machine learning model to look\nfor faulty attributes by providing it\nwith a data on deliquent\nand non-delinquent customers.\nNext comes the healthcare sector in the healthcare sector.\nIt is used to predict the patient's readmission rates\nby building a regression model\nby providing data\non the patients treatment Administration and readmissions\nto show variables\nthat best correlate with readmission.\nNext comes the retail sector and Retail sector.\nIt is used to analyze the product\nthat a customer by together.\nIt does this by building a supervised model\nto identify frequent itemsets\nand Association rule from the transactional data now,\nlets learn about the next category\nof machine learning the unsupervised part mathematically\nunsupervised learning is\nwhere you only\nhave Put data X and no corresponding output variable.\nThe goal for unsupervised learning is to model\nthe underlying structure\nor distribution in the data\nin order to learn more about the data.\nSo let me rephrase you this in simple terms\nin unsupervised learning approach the data instances\nof a training data set do not have\nan expected output Associated\nto them instead unsupervised\nlearning algorithm detects pattern based\non innate characteristics\nof the input data an example of machine learning tasks.\nAsk that applies unsupervised learning is clustering\nin this task similar data instances are grouped together\nin order to identify clusters of data in this slide.\nYou can see that initially we have different varieties\nof fruits as input.\nNow these set of fruits as input X are given to the model.\nNow, what is the model is trained using\nunsupervised learning algorithm.\nThe model will create clusters on the basis of its training.\nIt will grip the similar fruits and make their cluster.\nLet me make things more clearer to you.\nLet's take another example of it.\nSo in this Slide the image below shows an example\nof unsupervised learning process this algorithm processes\nan unlabeled training data set\nand based on the characteristics.\nIt grips the picture\ninto three different clusters of data despite the ability\nof grouping similar data into clusters.\nThe algorithm is not capable to add labels to the crow.\nThe algorithm only knows which data instances are similar,\nbut it cannot identify the meaning of this group.\nSo, Now you might be wondering why this category\nof machine learning is named as unsupervised learning.\nSo these are called as\nunsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning ever.\nThere are no correct answer\nand there is no teacher algorithms are left\non their own to discover\nand present the interesting structure in the data.\nLet's move on and see some\nof the popular unsupervised learning algorithm.\nSo we have here k-means apriori algorithm\nand hierarchical clustering now,\nlet's move on and see some of the examples\nof Is learning suppose a friend invites you to his party\nand where you meet totally strangers.\nNow, you will classify them using unsupervised learning\nas you don't have any prior knowledge about them\nand this classification can be done on the basis\nof gender age group dressing education qualification\nor whatever way you might like now why\nthis learning is different from supervised learning\nsince you didn't use any pasta prior knowledge\nabout the people you kept on classifying them on the go\nas they kept on coming you kept on classifying them.\nYeah, this category of people belong to this group\nthis category of people belong to that group and so on.\nOkay, let's see one more example.\nLet's suppose you have never seen a football match before\nand by chance you watch a video on the internet.\nNow, you can easily classify the players on the basis\nof different Criterion,\nlike player wearing the same kind of Jersey are\nin one class player wearing different kind\nof Jersey aren't different class\nor you can classify them on the basis\nof their playing style like the guys are attacker.\nSo he's in one class.\nHe's a Defender he's Another class\nor you can classify them.\nWhatever Way You observe the things\nso this was also an example of unsupervised learning.\nLet's move on and see\nhow unsupervised learning is used in the sectors\nof banking Healthcare undertale.\nSo starting at banking sector.\nSo in banking sector it is used to segment customers\nby behavioral characteristic by surveying prospects\nand customers to develop multiple segments\nusing clustering and Healthcare sector.\nIt is used to categorize the MRI data by normal or abnormal.\nAges it uses deep learning techniques to build a model\nthat learns from different features of images to recognize\na different pattern.\nNext is the retail sector and Retail sector.\nIt is used to recommend the products to customer\nbased on their past purchases.\nIt does this by building a collaborative filtering model\nbased on the past purchases by them.\nI assume you guys\nnow have a proper idea of what unsupervised learning means\nif you have any slightest doubt\ndon't hesitate and add your doubt to the I'm in section.\nSo let's discuss the third\nand the last type of machine learning\nthat is reinforcement learning.\nSo what is reinforcement learning?\nWell reinforcement learning\nis a type of machine learning algorithm\nwhich allows software agents\nand machine to automatically determine the ideal Behavior\nwithin a specific context to maximize its performance.\nThe reinforcement learning is about interaction\nbetween two elements\nthe environment and the learning agent\nthe learning agent leverages to mechanism namely exploration.\nAnd exploitation when learning agent acts on trial\nand error basis,\nit is termed as exploration\nand when it acts based on the knowledge gained\nfrom the environment,\nit is referred to as exploitation.\nNow this environment rewards the agent for correct actions,\nwhich is reinforcement signal leveraging the rewards\nobtain the agent\nimproves its environment knowledge to select\nthe next action in this image.\nYou can see that the machine is confused\nwhether it is an apple or it's not an apple\nthen the Sheena's chain using reinforcement learning.\nIf it makes correct decision.\nIt get rewards point for it\nand in case of wrong it gets a penalty for that.\nOnce the training is done.\nNow.\nThe machine can easily identify which one of them is an apple.\nLet's see an example here.\nWe can see that we have an agent\nwho has to judge from the environment to find out\nwhich of the two is a duck the first task\nhe did is to observe the environment next.\nWe select some action using some policy.\nIt seems that the machine has made a wrong decision.\nBye.\nChoosing a bunny as a duck.\nSo the machine will get penalty for it.\nFor example - 50.4 a wrong answer right now.\nThe machine will update its policy\nand this will continue\ntill the machine gets an optimal policy\nfrom the next time machine will know that bunny is not a duck.\nLet's see some of the use cases of reinforcement learning\nbut before that lets see\nhow Pavlo trained his dog using reinforcement learning\nor how he applied\nthe reinforcement method to train his dog.\nBabu integrated learning\nin four stages initially Pavlo gave me to his dog\nand in response to the meet the dog started salivating next\nwhat he did he created a sound\nwith the bell for this the dog did not respond anything\nin the third part it tried to condition the dog\nby using the bell\nand then giving him the food seeing the food\nthe dog started salivating eventually a situation came\nwhen the dog started salivating just after hearing the Bell even\nif the food was not given to him as the The dog was reinforced\nthat whenever the master will ring the bell he\nwill get the food now.\nLet's move on and see\nhow reinforcement learning is applied in the field\nof banking Healthcare and Retail sector.\nSo starting with the banking sector\nin banking sector reinforcement learning is used to create\na next best offer model\nfor a call center by building a predictive model\nthat learns over time\nas user accept or reject offer made by the sales staff fine now\nin healthcare sector it is used to allocate the scars.\nResources to handle different type of er\ncases by building a Markov decision process\nthat learns treatment strategies for each type of er case next\nand the last comes in retail sector.\nSo let's see\nhow reinforcement learning is applied to retail sector\nand Retail sector.\nIt can be used to reduce excess stock\nwith Dynamic pricing by building a dynamic pricing model\nthat are just the price based\non customer response to the offers.\nI hope by now you have attained some understanding of\nwhat is machine learning and you are ready to move.\nMove ahead.\nWelcome to today's topic of discussion on AI\nversus machine learning versus deep learning.\nThese are the term which have confused a lot\nof people and if you two are one among them,\nlet me resolve it for you.\nWell artificial intelligence is a broader umbrella\nunder which machine learning\nand deep learning come you can also see in the diagram\nthat even deep learning\nis a subset of machine learning so you can say\nthat all three of them The AI and machine learning\nand deep learning are just the subset of each other.\nSo let's move on and understand\nhow exactly the differ from each other.\nSo let's start with artificial intelligence.\nThe term artificial intelligence\nwas first coined in the year 1956.\nThe concept is pretty old,\nbut it has gained its popularity recently.\nBut why well,\nthe reason is earlier we had very small amount of data\nthe data we had was not enough to predict the Turret result\nbut now there's a tremendous increase\nin the amount of data statistics\nsuggest that by 2020 the accumulated volume\nof data will increase\nfrom 4.4 zettabyte stew roughly around 44 zettabytes\nor 44 trillion jeebies\nof data along with such enormous amount of data.\nNow, we have more advanced algorithm\nand high-end computing power and storage\nthat can deal with such large amount of data as a result.\nIt is expected\nthat 70% of The price will Implement a i\nover the next 12 months\nwhich is up from 40 percent in 2016 and 51 percent in 2017.\nJust for your understanding.\nWhat does AI well,\nit's nothing but a technique\nthat enables the machine to act like humans\nby replicating the behavior and nature with AI\nit is possible\nfor machine to learn from the experience.\nThe machines are just their responses based\non new input there\nby performing human-like tasks artificial intelligence can be\nand to accomplish\nspecific tasks by processing large amount of data\nand recognizing pattern in them.\nYou can consider\nthat building an artificial intelligence is like Building\na Church the first church took generations to finish.\nSo most of the workers were working in it never saw\nthe final outcome those working\non it took pride in their craft building bricks\nand chiseling stone\nthat was going to be placed into the great structure.\nSo as AI researchers,\nwe should think of ourselves as humble brick makers was job.\nIt's just study\nhow to build components example Parts is planners\nor learning algorithm or Etc anything\nthat someday someone and somewhere will integrate\ninto the intelligent systems some of the examples\nof artificial intelligence from our day-to-day life\nare Apple series chess-playing computer Tesla self-driving car\nand many more these examples are based on deep learning\nand natural language processing.\nWell, this was about what is AI and how it gains its hype.\nSo moving on ahead.\nLet's Gus about machine learning and see what it is\nand why it was the when introduced well\nMachine learning came into existence in the late 80s\nand the early 90s,\nbut what were the issues with the people\nwhich made the machine learning come into existence let\nus discuss them one by one in the field of Statistics.\nThe problem was\nhow to efficiently train large complex model in the field\nof computer science and artificial intelligence.\nThe problem was how to train more robust version\nof AI system while in the case of Neuroscience.\nProblem faced by the researchers was\nhow to design operation model of the brain.\nSo these were some of the issues\nwhich had the largest influence and led to the existence\nof the machine learning.\nNow this machine learning shifted its focus\nfrom the symbolic approaches.\nIt had inherited from the AI and move\ntowards the methods and model.\nIt had borrowed from statistics and probability Theory.\nSo let's proceed and see\nwhat exactly is machine learning.\nWell Machine learning is a subset of AI\nwhich enables the computer to act\nand make data-driven decisions to carry out a certain task.\nThese programs are algorithms are designed in a way\nthat they can learn and improve over time\nwhen exposed to new data.\nLet's see an example of machine learning.\nLet's say you want to create a system\nwhich tells the expected weight of a person based on its side.\nThe first thing you do is you collect the data.\nLet's see there is\nhow your data looks like now each point\non the graph represent one data point to start\nwith we can draw a simple line to predict the weight based\non the height for Sample a simple line W equal x\nminus hundred with W is waiting kgs and edges hide\nand centimeter this line can help us to make the prediction.\nOur main goal is to reduce the difference\nbetween the estimated value and the actual value.\nSo in order to achieve it,\nwe try to draw a straight line that fits through all\nthese different points and minimize the error.\nSo our main goal is to minimize the error\nand make them as small as possible decreasing the error\nor the difference between the actual value and estimated.\nValue increases the performance of the model further\non the more data points.\nWe collect the better.\nOur model will become we can also improve our model\nby adding more variables\nand creating different production lines for them.\nOnce the line is created.\nSo from the next time if we feed a new data,\nfor example height of a person to the model,\nit would easily predict the data for you and it will tell you\nwhat has predicted weight could be.\nI hope you got a clear understanding\nof machine learning.\nSo moving on ahead.\nLet's learn about deep learning now what is deep learning?\nYou can consider deep learning model as a rocket engine\nand its fuel is its huge amount of data\nthat we feed to these algorithms the concept\nof deep learning is not new,\nbut recently it's hype as increase\nand deep learning is getting more attention.\nThis field is a particular kind of machine learning\nthat is inspired by\nthe functionality of our brain cells called neurons\nwhich led to the concept of artificial neural network.\nIt simply takes\nthe data connection between all the artificial neurons\nand adjust them according to the data pattern.\nMore neurons are added\nat the size of the data is large it automatically features\nlearning at multiple levels of abstraction.\nThereby allowing a system\nto learn complex function mapping without depending\non any specific algorithm.\nYou know, what no one actually knows what happens\ninside a neural network and why it works so well,\nso currently you can call it as a black box.\nLet us discuss some of the example of deep learning\nand understand it in a better way.\nLet me start with in simple example\nand explain you how things And at a conceptual level,\nlet us try and understand\nhow you would recognize a square from other shapes.\nThe first thing you do is you check\nwhether there are four lines associated with a figure\nor not simple concept, right?\nIf yes, we further check\nif they are connected and closed again a few years.\nWe finally check whether it is perpendicular\nand all its sides are equal, correct.\nIf everything fulfills.\nYes, it is a square.\nWell, it is nothing but a nested hierarchy of Concepts.\nWhat we did here we took a complex task\nof identifying a square\nand this case and broken into simpler tasks.\nNow this deep learning also does the same thing\nbut at a larger scale,\nlet's take an example of machine which recognizes\nthe animal the task of the machine is to recognize\nwhether the given image is of a cat or a dog.\nWhat if we were asked to resolve the same issue using the concept\nof machine learning what we would do first.\nWe would Define the features such as\ncheck whether the animal has whiskers or not a check.\nThe animal has pointed ears\nor not or whether its tail is straight or curved in short.\nWe will Define the facial features and let\nthe system identify which features are more important\nin classifying a particular animal now\nwhen it comes to deep learning it takes this to one step ahead\ndeep learning automatically finds are the feature\nwhich are most important for classification compare\ninto machine learning\nwhere we had to manually give out that features by now.\nI guess you have understood that AI is the bigger picture\nand machine learning and deep learning are it's apart.\nSo let's move on\nand focus our discussion on machine learning\nand deep learning the easiest way to understand the difference\nbetween the machine learning and deep learning is to know\nthat deep learning is machine learning more specifically.\nIt is the next evolution of machine learning.\nLet's take few important parameter\nand compare machine learning with deep learning.\nSo starting with data dependencies,\nthe most important difference between deep learning\nand machine learning is its performance as the volume\nof the data gets From the below graph.\nYou can see\nthat when the size of the data is small deep learning algorithm\ndoesn't perform that well,\nbut why well,\nthis is because deep learning algorithm needs\na large amount of data to understand it perfectly\non the other hand the machine learning algorithm can easily\nwork with smaller data set fine.\nNext comes the hardware dependencies deep learning\nalgorithms are heavily dependent on high-end machines\nwhile the machine learning algorithm can work\non low and machines as Well,\nthis is because the requirement\nof deep learning algorithm include gpus\nwhich is an integral part\nof its working the Deep learning algorithm requires gpus\nas they do a large\namount of matrix multiplication operations,\nand these operations\ncan only be efficiently optimized using a GPU\nas it is built for this purpose.\nOnly our third parameter\nwill be feature engineering well feature engineering is a process\nof putting the domain knowledge to reduce the complexity\nof the data.\nMake patterns more visible to learning algorithms.\nThis process is difficult and expensive in terms of time\nand expertise in case of machine learning\nmost other features are needed to be identified by an expert\nand then hand coded as per the domain\nand the data type.\nFor example, the features\ncan be a pixel value shapes texture position orientation\nor anything fine the performance\nof most of the machine learning algorithm depends\non how accurately the features are identified and stood\nwhere as in case\nof deep learning algorithms it try to learn high level features\nfrom the data.\nThis is a very distinctive part of deep learning\nwhich makes it way ahead\nof traditional machine learning deep learning reduces the task\nof developing new feature extractor for every problem\nlike in the case\nof CNN algorithm it first try to learn the low-level features\nof the image such as edges and lines\nand then it proceeds to the parts of faces of people\nand then finally to the high-level representation\nof the face.\nI hope that things Getting clearer to you.\nSo let's move on ahead and see the next parameter.\nSo our next parameter is problem solving approach\nwhen we are solving a problem using traditional machine\nlearning algorithm.\nIt is generally recommended\nthat we first break down the problem\ninto different sub parts solve them individually\nand then finally combine them to get the desired result.\nThis is how the machine learning algorithm handles the problem\non the other hand the Deep learning algorithm\nsolves the problem from end to end.\nLet's take an example.\nTo understand this suppose you have a task\nof multiple object detection.\nAnd your task is to identify.\nWhat is the object and where it is present in the image.\nSo, let's see and compare.\nHow will you tackle this issue using the concept\nof machine learning\nand deep learning starting with machine learning\nin a typical machine learning approach.\nYou would first divide the problem into two step\nfirst object detection and then object recognization.\nFirst of all,\nyou would use a bounding box detection algorithm\nlike grab could fight.\nSample to scan through the image\nand find out all the possible objects.\nNow, once the objects are recognized you would use\nobject recognization algorithm,\nlike svm with hog to recognize relevant objects.\nNow, finally,\nwhen you combine the result you would be able to identify.\nWhat is the object and where it is present\nin the image on the other hand in deep learning approach.\nYou would do the process from end to end for example\nin a yellow net\nwhich is a type of deep learning algorithm you would pass.\nAn image and it would give out the location along with the name\nof the object.\nNow, let's move on to our fifth comparison parameter\nits execution time.\nUsually a deep learning algorithm takes a long time\nto train this is\nbecause there's so\nmany parameter in a deep learning algorithm\nthat makes the training longer\nthan usual the training might even last for two weeks\nor more than that.\nIf you are training completely from the scratch,\nwhereas in the case of machine learning,\nit relatively takes much less time to train ranging\nfrom a few weeks.\nToo few Arts.\nNow.\nThe execution time is completely reversed\nwhen it comes to the testing of data during testing\nthe Deep learning algorithm takes much less time to run.\nWhereas if you compare it with a KNN algorithm,\nwhich is a type of machine learning algorithm the test\ntime increases as the size of the data increase last\nbut not the least we have interpretability as\na factor for comparison of machine learning\nand deep learning.\nThis fact is the main reason why deep learning is still\nthought ten times before anyone knew.\nUses it in the industry.\nLet's take an example suppose.\nWe use deep learning to give\nautomated scoring two essays the performance it gives\nand scoring is quite excellent and is near\nto the human performance,\nbut there's an issue with it.\nIt does not reveal white\nhas given that score indeed mathematically.\nIt is possible to find out\nthat which node of a deep neural network were activated,\nbut we don't know\nwhat the neurons are supposed to model\nand what these layers of neurons are doing collectively.\nSo if To interpret the result\non the other hand machine learning algorithm,\nlike decision tree gives us a crisp rule for void chose\nand watered chose.\nSo it is particularly easy to interpret the reasoning\nbehind therefore the algorithms like decision tree\nand linear or logistic\nregression are primarily used in industry for interpretability.\nLet me summarize things\nfor you machine learning uses algorithm to parse\nthe data learn from the data\nand make informed decision based on what it has learned fine.\nin this deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create\nartificial neural network\nthat can learn\nand make Intelligent Decisions on their own finally\ndeep learning is a subfield of machine learning\nwhile both fall under the broad category\nof artificial intelligence deep learning is usually\nwhat's behind the most\nhuman-like artificial intelligence now\nin early days scientists used to have a lab notebook\nto Test progress results\nand conclusions now Jupiter is a modern-day\nto that allows data scientists\nto record the complete analysis process much\nin the same way other scientists use a lab notebook.\nNow, the Jupiter product was originally developed as a part\nof IPython project the iPad\nand project was used to provide interactive online access\nto python over time.\nIt became useful to interact\nwith other data analysis tools such as are in the same manner\nwith the split from python\nthe tool crew in in his current manifestation of Jupiter.\nNow IPython is still an active tool\nthat's available for use.\nThe name Jupiter itself is derived from the combination\nof Julia Python.\nAnd our while Jupiter runs code\nin many programming languages python is a requirement\nfor installing the jupyter notebook itself now\nto download jupyter notebook.\nThere are a few ways in their official website.\nIt is strongly recommended installing Python and Jupiter\nusing Anaconda distribution,\nwhich includes python Don't know what book\nand other commonly used packages\nfor scientific Computing as well as data science.\nAlthough one can also\ndo so using the pipe installation method personally.\nWhat I would suggest is downloading an app\non a navigator, which is\na desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda.\nNow, this allows you to launch application\nand easily manage conda packages environments\nand channels without the need to use command line commands.\nSo all you need to do is go to another Corner dot orgy\nand inside you go.\nTo Anaconda Navigators.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have the conda installation code which you're going\nto use to install it in your particular PC.\nSo either you can use these installers.\nSo once you download the Anaconda Navigator,\nit looks something like this.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have Jupiter lab jupyter notebook you have QT console,\nwhich is IPython console.\nWe have spider which is somewhat similar to a studio\nin terms of python again,\nwe have a studio so we have orange three\nWe have glue is and we have VSC code.\nOur Focus today would be on this jupyter notebook itself.\nNow when you launch the Navigator,\nyou can see there are many options available\nfor launching python as well.\nAs our instances Now by definition are jupyter.\nNotebook is fundamentally\na Json file with a number of annotations.\nNow, it has three main parts\nwhich are the metadata The Notebook format and the list\nof cells now you\nshould get yourself acquainted with the environment\nthat Jupiter user interface has a number of components.\nSo it's important to know\nwhat our components you should be using\non a daily basis and you should get acquainted with it.\nSo as you can see here\nour Focus today will be on the jupyter notebook.\nSo let me just launched the Japan and notebook.\nNow what it does is creates a online python instance\nfor you to use it over the web.\nSo let's launch now\nas you can see we have Jupiter on the top left\nas expected and this acts as a button to go\nto your home page whenever you click\non this you get back to your particular home paste.\nIs the dashboard now there are three tabs displayed\nwith other files running and clusters.\nNow, what will do is will understand all\nof these three and understand\nwhat are the importance\nof these three tabs other file tab shows the list\nof the current files in the directory.\nSo as you can see we have so many files here.\nNow the running tab\npresents another screen of the currently running processes\nand the notebooks now the drop-down list for the terminals\nand notebooks are populated with there.\nRunning numbers.\nSo as you can see inside,\nwe do not have any running terminals\nor there no running notebooks as of now\nand the cluster tab\npresents another screen to display the list\nof clusters available see in the top right corner of the screen.\nThere are three buttons which are upload new\nand the refresh button.\nLet me go back so you can see here.\nWe have the upload new and the refresh button.\nNow the upload button is used to add files\nto The Notebook space and you may also just drag and drop\nas you would when handling files.\nSimilarly, you can drag\nand drop notebooks into specific folders as well.\nNow the menu with the new in the top residents\nof further many of text file folders terminal\nand Python 3.\nNow, the test file option is used to add a text file\nto the current directory Jupiter will open a new browser window\nfor you for the running new text editor.\nNow, the text entered is automatically saved\nand will be displayed in your notebooks files display.\nNow the folder option\nwhat it does is creates a new folder.\nWith the name Untitled folder and remember all the files\nand folder names are editable.\nNow the terminal option allows you to start\nand IPython session.\nThe node would options available will be activated\nwhen additional note books are available in your environment.\nThe Python 3 option is used to begin pythons recession\ninteractively in your note.\nThe interface looks like the following screen shot.\nNow what you have is full file editing capabilities\nfor your script including saving as new file.\nYou also have a complete ID\nfor your python script now we come to the refresh button.\nThe refresh button is used to update the display.\nIt's not really necessary as a display is reactive\nto any changes in the underlying file structure.\nI had a talk with the files tab item.\nThere is a check box drop\ndown menu and a home button as you can see here.\nWe have the checkbox the drop-down menu\nand the home button.\nNow the check box is used to toggle all the checkboxes\nin the item list.\nSo as you can see you can select all of these when either move\nor either delete all of the file selected,\nIt or what you can do is select all\nand deselect some of the files\nas your wish now the drop down menu presents a list\nof choices available,\nwhich are the folders all notebooks running\nand files to the folder section\nwill select all the folders in the display\nand present account of the folders in the small box.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have 18 number of folders now all the notebooks section\nwill change the count of the number of nodes\nand provide you with three option\nso you can see here.\nIt has selected all the given notebooks\nwhich are a In a number\nand you get the option to either duplicate the current notebook.\nYou need to move it view it edit it or delete.\nNow, the writing section will select any running scripts\nas you can see here.\nWe have zero running scripts\nand update the count to the number selected.\nNow the file section will select all the files\nin the notebook display and update the counts accordingly.\nSo if you select the files here,\nwe are seven files as you can see here.\nWe have seven files some datasets CSV files\nand text files now the home button.\nBrings you back to the home screen of the notebook.\nSo on you to do is click on the jupyter.\nNotebook lower.\nIt will bring you back to the Jupiter notebook dashboard.\nNow, as you can see on the left hand side\nof every item is a checkbox and I can and the items name.\nThe checkbox is used to build a set of files to operate\nupon and the icon is indicated of of the type of the item.\nAnd in this case,\nall of the items are folder here coming down.\nWe have the ring notebooks.\nAnd finally we have certain files which are the text files\nand the As we files now a typical workflow\nof any jupyter.\nNotebook is to first of all create a notebook\nfor the project or your data analysis.\nAdd your analysis step coding\nand output and Surround your analysis with organization\nand presentation mark down to communicate\nand entire story now interactive notebooks\nthat include widgets and display modules\nwill then be used by others by modifying parameters\nand the data to note the effects of the changes now\nif we talk about security jupyter notebooks are created\nin order to Be shared with other users in many cases\nover the Internet.\nHowever, jupyter notebook can execute arbitrary code\nand generate arbitrary code.\nThis can be a problem.\nIf malicious aspects have been placed\nin the note Now the default security mechanism for Japan\nor notebooks include raw HTML,\nwhich is always sanitized and check for malicious coding.\nAnother aspect is you cannot run external Java scripts.\nNow the cell contents,\nespecially the HTML and the JavaScript are not trusted\nit requires user value.\nNation to continue\nand the output from any cell is not trusted all other HTML\nor JavaScript is never trusted\nand clearing the output will cause the notebook\nto become trusted\nwhen save now notebooks can also use a security digest\nto ensure the correct user is modifying the contents.\nSo for that what you need to do is a digest\nwhat it does is takes into the account\nthe entire contents of the notebook and a secret\nwhich is only known by The Notebook Creator\nand this combination ensures\nthat malicious coding is is not going to be added\nto the notebook\nso you can add security to address to notebook\nusing the following command which I have given here.\nSo it's Jupiter the profile\nwhat you have selected and inside you\nwhat you need to do is security and notebook secret.\nSo what you can do is replace the notebooks\nsecret with your putter secret\nand that will act as a key for the particular notebook.\nSo what you need to do is share that particular key\nwith all your colleagues\nor whoever you want to share that particular notebook\nwith and in that case,\nit keeps the notebooks.\nGeode and away from other malicious coders\nand all other aspect of Jupiter is configuration.\nSo you can configure some of the display parameters used\nand presenting notebooks.\nNow, these aren't configurable due to the use of product known\nas code mirror to present and modify the notebook.\nSo cold mirror water basically is it is a JavaScript\nbased editor for the u.s.\nWithin the web pages and notebooks.\nSo what you do is what you do code mirror,\nso as you can see here\ncode mirror is a versatile text editor implemented.\nIn JavaScript for the browser.\nSo what it does is\nallow you to configure the options for Jupiter.\nSo now let's execute some python code\nand understand the notebook in A Better Way Jupiter\ndoes not interact\nwith your scripts as much as it executes your script\nand request the result.\nSo I think this is how jupyter notebooks\nhave been extended to other languages besides python\nas it just takes\na script runs it against a particular language engine\nand across the output from the engine all\nthe while not Really knowing what kind\nof a script is being executed now the new windows shows\nand empty cell\nfor you to enter the python code know\nwhat you need to do is under new you select the Python 3 and\nwhat I will do is open a new notebook.\nNow this notebook is Untitled.\nSo let's give the new work area and name python code.\nSo as you can see we have renamed this particular cell\nnow order save option should be on the next to the title\nas you can see last.\nCheckpoint a few days ago, unsaved changes.\nThe autosave option is always on what we do is\nwith an accurate name.\nWe can find the selection\nand this particular notebook very easily\nfrom The Notebook home page.\nSo if you select your browser's Home tab\nand refresh you will find\nthis new window name displayed here again.\nSo if you just go to a notebook home\nand as you can see,\nI mentioned it by then quotes and under running.\nAlso, you have the pilot and quotes here.\nSo let's get back to the Particular page\nor the notebook one thing to note here\nthat it has\nand does an item icon versus a folder icon\nthough automatically assigned extension\nas you can see here is ipy and be the IPython note and says\nthe item is in a browser in a Jupiter environment.\nIt is marked as running answer\nis a file by that name in this directory as well.\nSo if you go to your directory,\nlet me go and check it.\nSo as you can see if you go into the users are you\ncan see we have the in class projects\nthat Python codes like the series automatically\nhave that particular IPython notebook created\nin our working environment\nand the local disk space also.\nSo if you open the IP y + B file in a text editor,\nyou will see basic context of a Jupiter code as you can see\nif I'm opening it.\nThe cells are empty.\nNothing is there so let's type in some code here.\nFor example, I'm going to put in name equals edgy Rekha.\nNext what I'm going to do is provide subscribers\nthat equals seven hundred gay and to run this particular cell.\nWhat you need to do is click on the run Icon\nand it will see here we have one.\nSo this is the first set to be executed in the second cell.\nWe enter python code\nthat references the variables from the first cell.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have friend named has strings subscribers.\nSo let me just run this particular.\nSo as you can see here note.\nNow that we have an output here\nthat Erica has 700k YouTube subscriber now\nsince more than 700 K now to know more about Jupiter\nand other Technologies,\nwhat you can do is subscribe to our Channel and get\nupdates on the latest trending Technologies.\nSo note that Jupiter color codes\nyour python just as decent editor vote\nand we have empty braces\nto the left of each code block such as you can see here.\nIf we execute the cell\nthe results are displayed in line now, it's interesting\nthat Jupiter keeps.\nThe output last generated in the saved version of the file\nand it's a save checkpoints.\nNow, if we were to rerun your cells using the rerun\nor the run all the output would be generated\nand c8y autosave now,\nthe cell number is incremented and as you can see\nif I rerun this you see the cell number change\nfrom one to three\nand if I rerun this the Selma will change from 2 to 4.\nSo what Jupiter does is keeps a track of the latest version\nof each cell so similarly\nif you are to close the browser tab It's the display\nin the Home tab.\nYou will find a new item we created\nwhich is the python code your notebook saved autosaved\nas you can see here in the bracket has autosaved.\nSo if we close this in the home button,\nyou can see here.\nWe have python codes.\nSo as you can see if we click that it opens the same notebook.\nIt has the previously\ndisplayed items will be always there showing the output sweat\nthat we generated in the last run now\nthat we have seen how python Works\nin Jupiter including the underlying encoding then\nhow this python.\nThis allows data set or data set Works in Jupiter.\nSo let me create another new python notebook.\nSo what I'm going to do is name this as pandas.\nSo from here,\nwhat we will do is read in last dataset\nand compute some standard statistics of data.\nNow what we are interested in in seeing\nhow to use the pandas in Jupiter\nhow well the script performs\nand what information is stored in the metadata,\nespecially if it's a large dataset\nso our Python script accesses the iris dataset here\nthat's built into one of the Python packages.\nNow.\nAll we are looking in to do is to read in slightly large number\nof items and calculate some basic operations\non the data set.\nSo first of all,\nwhat we need to do is\nfrom sklearn import the data set so sklearn\nis scikit-learn and it is another library of python.\nIt contains a lot of data sets for machine learning\nand all the algorithms\nwhich are present for machine learning\nand the data sets which are there so,\nSo import was successful.\nSo what we're going to do now is pull in the IRS data.\nWhat we're going to do is Iris underscore data set equals\nand the load on the screen now that should do and I'm sorry,\nit's data set start lower.\nSo so as you can see here,\nthe number here is considered three now\nbecause in the second drawer\nand we encountered an error it was data set.\nHe's not data set.\nSo so what we're going\nto do is grab the first two corner of the data.\nSo let's pretend x equals.\nIf you press the tab, it automatically detects\nwhat you're going to write as Todd datasets dot data.\nAnd what we're going to do is take the first two rows comma\nnot to run it from your keyboard.\nAll you need to do is press shift + enter.\nSo next what we're going to do is calculate\nsome basic statistics.\nSo what we're going to do is X underscore.\nCount equals x I'm going to use the length function and said\nthat we're going to use x dot flat similarly.\nWe going to see X-Men\nand X Max and the Min our display our results.\nWhat we're going to do is you just play the results now, so\nas you can see the counter 300 the minimum value is 3.8 m/s.\nAnd what is 0.4\nand the mean is five point eight four three three three.\nSo let me connect you to the real life\nand tell you what all are the things\nwhich you can easily do using the concepts of machine learning\nso you can easily get answer to the questions\nlike which types of house lies in this segment\nor what is the market value of this house or is this\na male as spam or not spam?\nIs there any fraud?\nWell, these are some of the question you could ask\nto the machine\nbut for getting an answer to these you need some algorithm\nthe machine need to train on the basis of some algorithm.\nOkay, but how will you decide which algorithm\nto choose and when?\nOkay.\nSo the best option for us is to explore them one by one.\nSo the first is classification algorithm\nwhere the categories predicted using the data\nif you have some question,\nlike is this person a male\nor a female or is this male a Spam or not?\nSpam then these category of question would fall\nunder the classification algorithm classification is\na supervised learning approach\nin which the computer program learns from the input\ngiven to it\nand then uses\nthis learning to classify new observation some examples\nof classification problems\nare speech organization handwriting recognized.\nShouldn't biometric identification document\nclassification Etc.\nSo next is the anomaly detection algorithm\nwhere you identify the unusual data point.\nSo what is an anomaly detection.\nWell, it's a technique\nthat is used to identify unusual pattern\nthat does not conform to expected Behavior\nor you can say the outliers.\nIt has many application\nin business like intrusion detection,\nlike identifying strange patterns in the network traffic\nthat could signal a hack or system Health monitoring\nthat is sporting a deadly tumor in the MRI scan\nor you can even use it\nfor fraud detection credit card transaction\nor to deal with fault detection in operating environment.\nSo next comes the clustering algorithm,\nyou can use this clustering algorithm to group the data\nbased on some similar condition.\nNow you can get answer to which type of houses lies\nin this segment or what type of customer buys this product.\nThe clustering is a task of dividing the population\nor data points into number of groups such\nthat the data point and the same groups are more.\nHello to other data points in the same group than those\nin the other groups in simple words.\nThe aim is to segregate groups with similar trait\nand assigning them into cluster.\nNow this clustering is a task of dividing the population\nor data points into a number of groups such\nthat the data points\nin the X group is more similar to the other data points\nin the same group rather than those in the other group.\nIn other words.\nThe aim is to segregate the groups with similar traits\nand assigning them into different clusters.\nLet's understand this\nwith an example Suppose you are the head of a rental store\nand you wish to understand the preference of your customer\nto scale up your business.\nSo is it possible\nfor you to look at the detail of each customer and design\na unique business strategy for each of them?\nDefinitely not right?\nBut what you can do is to Cluster all your customer saying\nto 10 different groups based on their purchasing habit\nand you can use a separate strategy\nfor customers in each of these ten different groups.\nAnd this is what we call clustering.\nNext we have regression algorithm where the data\nitself is predicted question.\nYou may ask to this type of model is like what is\nthe market value of this house\nor is it going to rain tomorrow or not?\nSo regression is one of the most important and broadly\nused machine learning and statistics tool.\nIt allows you to make prediction from data by learning\nthe relationship between the features of your data\nand some observe continuous valued response regulation\nis used in a massive number of application.\nYou know, what stock Isis prediction can be done\nusing regression now,\nyou know about different machine learning algorithm.\nHow will you decide which algorithm to choose\nand when so let's cover this part using a demo.\nSo in this demo part\nwhat we will do will create six different machine learning model\nand pick the best model and build the confidence such\nthat it has the most reliable accuracy.\nSo far our demo part will be using the IRS data set.\nThis data set is quite very famous\nand is considered one of the best small project to start\nwith you can consider\nthis as a hello world data set for machine learning.\nSo this data set consists\nof 150 observation of Iris flower.\nTherefore Columns of measurement of flowers in centimeters\nthe fifth column being the species\nof the flower observe all the observed flowers belong\nto one of the three species of Iris setosa Iris virginica\nand Iris versicolor.\nWell, this is a good good project\nbecause it is so well to understand\nthe attributes are numeric.\nSo you have to figure out how to load and handle the data.\nIt is a classification problem.\nThereby allowing you to practice\nwith perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\nIt has only four attributes and 150 rose.\nMeaning it is very small\nand can easily fit into the memory and even all\nof the numeric attributes are in same unit\nand the same scale means you do not require any special scaling\nor transformation to get started.\nSo let's start coding and as I told earlier for the\nBut I'll be using Anaconda with python 3.0 install on it.\nSo when you install Anaconda\nhow your Navigator would look like.\nSo there's my home page of my anaconda navigator on this.\nI'll be using the jupyter notebook,\nwhich is a web-based interactive Computing notebook environment,\nwhich will help me to write and execute my python codes on it.\nSo let's hit the launch button and execute\nour jupyter notebook.\nSo as you can see\nthat my jupyter notebook is starting on localhost\ndouble eight nine zero.\nOkay, so there's my jupyter notebook\nwhat I'll do here.\nI'll select new.\nbook Python 3 Does my environment where I can write\nand execute all my python codes on it?\nSo let's start by checking the version\nof the libraries in order to make this video short\nand more interactive and more informative.\nI've already written the set of code.\nSo let me just copy and paste it down.\nI'll explain you then one by one.\nSo let's start\nby checking the version of the Python libraries.\nOkay, so there is the code let's just copy\nit copied and let's paste it.\nOkay first let\nme summarize things for you what we are doing here.\nWe are just checking the version\nof the different libraries starting\nwith python will first check what version\nof python we are working on then we'll check\nwhat are the version of sci-fi we are using\nthe numpy matplotlib then Panda then scikit-learn.\nOkay.\nSo let's execute the Run button and see\nwhat are the various versions of libraries\nwhich we are using it the run.\nSo we are working on Python 3 point 6 point 4 PSI by 1.0 now.\nBy 1.1 for matplotlib 2.12 pandas 0.22 and scikit-learn\nor version 0.19.\nOkay.\nSo these are the version\nwhich I'm using ideally your version should be more recent\nor it should match but don't worry\nif you lack a few versions behind\nas the API is do not change so quickly everything\nin this tutorial will very likely still work for you.\nOkay, but in case you\nare getting an error stop and try to fix that error\nin case you are unable to find the solution for the error,\nfeel free to reach out at Eureka even after the This class.\nLet me tell you this\nif you are not able to run the script properly,\nyou will not be able to complete this tutorial.\nOkay, so whenever you get a doubt reach out\nto a deal-breaker and just resolve it now,\neverything is working smoothly then now is the time\nto load the data set.\nSo as I said,\nI'll be using the iris flower data set for this tutorial\nbut before loading the data set,\nlet's import all the modules function and the object\nwhich we are going to use in this tutorial same\nI've already written the set of code.\nSo let's just copy and paste them.\nLet's load all the libraries.\nSo these are the various libraries\nwhich will be using in our tutorial.\nSo everything should work fine without an error.\nIf you get an error just stop you need to work\non your cyber environment before you continue any further.\nSo I guess everything should work fine.\nLet's hit the Run button and see.\nOkay, it worked.\nSo let's now move ahead and load the data.\nWe can load the data direct\nfrom the UCI machine learning repository.\nFirst of all,\nlet me tell you we are using Panda to load the data.\nOkay.\nSo let's say my URL.\nIs this so This is\nMy URL for the use your machine learning repository\nfrom where I will be downloading the data set.\nOkay.\nNow what I'll do,\nI'll specify the name of each column\nwhen loading the data.\nThis will help me later to explore the data.\nOkay, so I'll just copy and paste it down.\nOkay, so I'm defining a variable names\nwhich consists of various parameters\nincluding sepal length sepal width petal length battle\nwith and class.\nSo these are just the name of column from the data set.\nOkay.\nNow let's define the data set.\nSo data set equals Panda dot read underscore CSV inside\nthat we are defining URL and the names\nthat is equal to name.\nAs I already said we'll be using Panda to load the data.\nAlright, so we are using Panda dot read CSV,\nso we are reading.\nThe CSV file and inside that\nfrom where that CSV is coming from the URL which you are.\nSo there's my URL.\nOkay name sequel names.\nIt's just specifying the names of the various columns\nin that particular CSV file.\nOkay.\nSo let's move forward and execute it.\nSo even our data set is loaded.\nIn case you have some network issues just go ahead\nand download the iris data file into your working directory\nand loaded using the same method but your make sure\nthat you change the url to the local name\nor else you might get an error.\nOkay.\nYeah, our data set is loaded.\nSo let's move ahead and check out data set.\nLet's see how many columns or rows we have in our data set.\nOkay.\nSo let's print the number\nof rows and columns in our data set.\nSo our data set is data set dot shape\nwhat this will do.\nIt will just give you the numbers of total number\nof rows and 2.\nLittle more of column or you can say the total number\nof instances are attributes in your data set fine.\nSo print data set dot shape audio getting 150 and 500.\nSo 150 is the total number of rows in your data set\nand five is the total number of columns fine.\nSo moving on ahead.\nWhat if I want to see the sample data set?\nOkay.\nSo let me just print the first certain instances\nof the data set.\nOkay, so print data set.\nHead.\nWhat I want is the first 30 instances fine.\nThis will give me the first 30 result of my data set.\nOkay.\nSo when I hit the Run button\nwhat I am getting is the first 30 result,\nokay 0 to 29.\nSo this is\nhow my sample data set looks like sepal length sepal\nwidth petal and petal width and the class, okay.\nSo this is how our data set looks like now,\nlet's move on\nand look at the summary of each attribute.\nWhat if I want to find out the count mean the minimum\nand the maximum values and some other percentiles as well.\nSo what should I do then\nfor that print data set dot described.\nWhat did we give let's see.\nSo you can see\nthat all the numbers are the same scales of similar range\nbetween 0 to 8 centimeters,\nright the mean value the standard deviation\nthe minimum value the 25 percentile\n50 percentile 75 percentile\nthe maximum value all these values lies\nin the range between 0 to 8 centimeter.\nOkay.\nSo what we just did is we just took a summary\nof each attribute.\nNow, let's look at the number of instances\nthat belong to each class.\nSo for that what we'll do print data set.\nFirst of all,\nso let's print data set\nand I want to group it Group by using class\nand I want the size of it size of each class fine,\nand let's hit the Run.\nOkay.\nSo what I want to do,\nI want to print print out data set.\nHowever want to get it.\nI want it by class.\nSo Group by class.\nOkay.\nNow I want the size\nof each class find the size of each class.\nSo Group by class dot size and skewed the run\nso you can see\nthat I have 50 instances of Iris setosa 50 instances\nof Iris versicolor\nand 50 instances of Iris virginica.\nOkay, all our of data type integer of base64 fine.\nSo now we have a basic idea of Data, now,\nlet's move ahead and create some visualization for it.\nSo for this we are going to create two different types\nof plot first would be the univariate plot\nand the next would be the multivariate plot.\nSo we'll be creating univariate plots to better understand\nabout each attribute\nand the next will be creating the multivariate plot to better\nunderstand the relationship between different attributes.\nOkay.\nSo we start with some univariate plot\nthat is plot of each individual variable.\nSo given that the input variables are numeric\nwe can create box and whiskers plot for it.\nOkay.\nSo let's move ahead and create a box and whiskers plot\nso data set Dot Plot.\nWhat kind I want it's a box.\nOkay, I'm do I need a subplot?\nYeah, I need subplots for that.\nSo subplots equal to what type\nof layout do I won't so my layout structure is\n2 cross 2 next do I want to share my coordinates X\nand Y coordinates.\nNo, I don't want to share it.\nSo share x equal false\nand even share why that 2 equals false?\nOkay.\nSo we have our data set Dot Plot kind equal box.\nMy subplots is to lay out to Us too and then\nwhat I want to do it,\nI want to see so Plot show whatever I created short.\nOkay, execute it.\nNot just gives us a much clearer idea\nabout the distribution of the input attribute.\nNow what if I had given the layout to 2 cross 2 instead\nof that I would have given it for cross for so\nwhat it will result just see fine.\nEverything would be printed in just one single row.\nHold on guys area is a doubt.\nHe's asking that why we're using the sheriff's\nand share y values.\nWhat are these why we have assigned false values to it?\nOkay Ariel.\nSo in order to resolve this query,\nI need to show you what will happen\nif I give True Values to them.\nOkay, so be with me so share its go.\nPull through and share why that equals true.\nSo let's see what result will get.\nYou're getting it the X\nand y-coordinates are just shared among all the\nfor visualization.\nRight?\nSo are you can see\nthat the sepal length and sepal width has\ny values ranging from zero point zero two seven point five\nwhich are being shared\namong both the visualization so is with the petal length.\nIt has shared value\nbetween zero point zero two seven point five.\nOkay, so that is why I don't want to share\nthe value of X and Y,\nso it's just giving us a cluttered visualization.\nSo Aria why I'm doing this.\nI'm just doing it\ncause I don't want my X and Y coordinates To be shared\namong any visualization.\nOkay.\nThat is why my share X and share by value are false.\nOkay, let's execute it.\nSo this is a pretty much Clear visualization\nwhich gives a clear idea about the distribution\nof the input attribute.\nNow if you want you can also create a histogram\nof each input variable to get a clear idea\nof the distribution.\nSo let's create a histogram for it.\nSo data set dot his okay.\nI would need to see it.\nSo plot dot show.\nLet's see.\nSo there's my histogram and it seems\nthat we have two input variables that have a go.\nAnd distribution so this is useful to note\nas we can use the algorithms\nthat can exploit this assumption.\nOkay.\nSo next comes the multivariate lat now\nthat we have created the univariate plot to understand\nabout each attribute.\nLet's move on and look at the multivariate plot and see\nthe interaction between the different variables.\nSo first, let's look at the scatter plot\nof all the attribute this can be helpful\nto spot structured relationship between input variables.\nOkay.\nSo let's create a scatter Matrix.\nSo for creating a scatter plot, we need scatter Matrix,\nand we need to pass our data set into It okay.\nAnd then what I want I want to see it.\nSo plot dot show.\nSo this is how my scatter Matrix looks\nlike it's like\nthat the diagonal grouping of some pear, right?\nSo this suggests a high correlation\nand a predictable relationship.\nAll right.\nThis was our multivariate plot.\nNow, let's move on and evaluate some algorithm\nthat's time to create some model of the data\nand estimate the accuracy on the basis of unseen data.\nOkay.\nSo now we know all about our data set, right?\nWe know how many instances\nand attributes are there in our data set.\nWe know the summary of each attribute.\nSo I guess we have seen much about our data set.\nNow.\nLet's move on and create some algorithm\nand estimate their accuracy based on the Unseen data.\nOkay.\nNow what we'll do we'll create some model of the data\nand estimate the accuracy based on the some unseen data.\nOkay.\nSo for that first of all,\nlet's create a validation data set.\nWhat is the validation data set validation data set is\nyour training data set\nthat will be using it to trainer model fine.\nAll right.\nSo how will create a validation data\nset for creating a validation data set?\nWhat we are going to do is we are going to split our data set\ninto two point.\nOkay.\nSo the very first thing we'll do is to create\na validation data set.\nSo why do we even need a validation data set?\nSo we need a validation data set know\nthat the model we created is any good later.\nWhat we'll do we'll use the statistical method\nto estimate the accuracy of the model that we create\non the Unseen data.\nWe also want a more concrete estimate of the accuracy\nof the best model\non unseen data by evaluating it on the actual unseen data.\nOkay confused.\nLet me simplify this for you.\nWhat we'll do we'll split the loaded data\ninto two parts the first 80 percent of the data.\nUser to train our model and the rest 20% will hold back\nas the validation data set\nthat will use it to verify our trained model.\nOkay fine.\nSo let's define an array.\nThis is my ra water it will consist of will consist\nof all the values from the data set.\nSo data set dot values.\nOkay next.\nI'll Define a variable X\nwhich will consist of all the column\nfrom the array from 0 to 4 starting from 0 to 4\nand the next variable Y\nwhich would consist of of the array starting from this.\nSo first of all,\nwe will Define a variable X that will consist of the values\nin the array starting from the beginning 0 Del for\nokay.\nSo these are the column which will include\nin the X variable\nand for a y variable I'll Define it as a class or the output.\nSo what I need,\nI just need the fourth column that is my class column.\nSo I'll start it from the beginning\nand I just want the fourth column.\nOkay now I'll Define the my validation size.\nValidation underscore sighs,\nI'll Define it as 0.20 and our use a seed I\nDefine CD equals 6.\nSo this method seed sets the integers starting value used\nin generating random number.\nOkay, I'll Define the value of C R equals x.\nI'll tell you what is the importance of that later on?\nOkay.\nSo let me Define first few variables such as X\nunderscore train test why underscore train\nand why underscore test Okay,\nso What do you want to do is Select some model.\nOkay, so module underscore selection.\nBut before doing\nthat what we have to do is split our training data set\ninto two halves.\nOkay, so dot train underscore test underscore split\nwhat you want to split is a value of X and Y.\nOkay and my test size is equals to validation size,\nwhich is a 0.20 correct and my random state.\nIs equal to seed so what the city is doing?\nIt's helping me to keep the same Randomness in the training\nand testing data set fine.\nSo let's execute it and see what is our result.\nIt's executed next.\nWe'll create a test harness for this.\nWe'll use 10-fold cross-validation to\nestimate the accuracy.\nSo what it will do it will split a data set\ninto 10 parts crane on the nine part\nand test on the one part\nand this will repeat for all combination of train\nand test pilots.\nOkay.\nSo for that,\nlet's define again my CD that was six already\nDefine and scoring equals accuracy fine.\nSo we are using the metric of accuracy to evaluate the model.\nSo what is this?\nThis is a ratio of number of correctly predicted instances\ndivided by the total number of instances in the data set x\nhundred giving a percentage example.\nIt's 98% accurate or 99% accurate things like that.\nOkay, so we'll be In the scoring variable\nwhen we run the build\nand evaluate each model in the next step.\nThe next part is building model till now.\nWe don't know which algorithm would be good for this problem\nor what configuration to use.\nSo let's begin with six different algorithm.\nI'll be using\nlogistic regression linear discriminant analysis,\nk-nearest neighbor classification and\nregression trees neighbor buys.\nAnd what Vector machine well\nthese algorithms chime using is a good mixture of simple linear\nor non-linear algorithms in simple linear switch.\nIncluded the logistic regression\nand the linear discriminant analysis or the nonlinear part\nwhich included the KNN algorithm the card algorithm\nthat the neighbor buys and the support Vector machines.\nOkay.\nSo we reset the random number seed\nbefore each run to ensure that evaluation\nof each algorithm\nis performed using exactly the same data spreads.\nIt ensures the result are directly comparable.\nOkay, so, let me just copy and paste it.\nOkay.\nSo what we're doing here,\nwe are building five different types of model.\nWe are building logistic regression\nlinear discriminant analysis,\nk-nearest neighbor decision tree ghajini buys\nand the support Vector machine.\nOkay next what we'll do we'll evaluate model in each turn.\nOkay.\nSo what is this?\nSo we have six different model\nand accuracy estimation for each one of them\nnow we need to compare the model to each other\nand select the most accurate of them all.\nSo running the script we saw the following result\nso we can see some of the results on the screen.\nWhat is It is just\nthe accuracy score using different set of algorithms.\nOkay, when we are using logistic regression,\nwhat is the accuracy rate\nwhen we are using linear discriminant algorithm?\nWhat is the accuracy and so-and-so?\nOkay.\nSo from the output with seems\nthat LD algorithm was the most accurate model\nthat we tested now,\nwe want to get an idea of the accuracy of the model\non our validation set or the testing data set.\nSo this will give us an independent final check\non the accuracy of the best model.\nIt is always valuable to keep our testing data set\nfor just in case you made a our overfitting\nto the testing data set\nor you made a data leak both will result\nin an overly optimistic result.\nOkay, you can run the ldo model directly on the validation set\nand summarize the result as a final score a confusion Matrix\nand a classification statistics and probability are essential\nbecause these disciples form the basic Foundation\nof all machine learning algorithms deep learning.\nSocial intelligence and data science,\nin fact mathematics and probability is\nbehind everything around us from shapes patterns\nand colors to the count\nof petals in a flower mathematics is embedded\nin each and every aspect of our lives.\nSo I'm going to go ahead and discuss the agenda\nfor today with you all we're going to begin\nthe session by understanding\nwhat is data after that.\nWe'll move on and look at the different categories\nof data like quantitative and Qualitative data,\nthen we'll discuss what exactly statistics is\nthe basic terminologies in statistics and a couple\nof sampling techniques.\nOnce we're done with that.\nWe'll discuss a different types of Statistics\nwhich involve descriptive and inferential statistics.\nThen in the next session,\nwe will mainly be focusing on descriptive statistics\nhere will understand the different measures\nof center measures of spread Information Gain\nand entropy will also\nunderstand all of these measures with the help of a user.\nAnd finally, we'll discuss what exactly a confusion Matrix is.\nOnce we've covered\nthe entire descriptive statistics module will discuss\nthe probability module\nhere will understand what exactly probability\nis the different terminologies in probability.\nWe will also study the different probability distributions,\nthen we'll discuss the types of probability which include\nmarginal probability joint and conditional probability.\nThen we move on\nand discuss a use case wherein we will see examples\nthat show us\nhow the different types of probability work\nand to better understand Bayes theorem.\nWe look at a small example.\nAlso, I forgot to mention\nthat at the end of the descriptive statistics module\nwill be running a small demo in the our language.\nSo for those of you who don't know much\nabout our I'll be explaining every line in depth,\nbut if you want to have a more in-depth understanding\nabout our I'll leave a couple of blocks.\nAnd a couple of videos in the description box\nyou all can definitely check out that content.\nNow after we've completed the probability module will discuss\nthe inferential statistics module will start this module\nby understanding\nwhat is point estimation will discuss\nwhat is confidence interval and how you can estimate\nthe confidence interval will also discuss margin of error\nand will understand all of these concepts by looking\nat a small use case.\nWe finally end the inferential Real statistic module by looking\nat what hypothesis testing is hypothesis.\nTesting is a very important part of inferential statistics.\nSo we'll end the session by looking at a use case\nthat discusses how hypothesis testing works\nand to sum everything up.\nWe'll look at a demo\nthat explains how inferential statistics works.\nRight?\nSo guys, there's a lot to cover today.\nSo let's move ahead and take a look at our first topic\nwhich is what is data.\nNow, this is a quite simple question\nif I ask any of You what is data?\nYou'll see that it's a set of numbers\nor some sort of documents\nthat have stored in my computer now data is actually everything.\nAll right, look around you there is data everywhere each click\non your phone generates more data than you know,\nnow this generated data provides insights for analysis\nand helps us make Better Business decisions.\nThis is why data is so important to give you\na formal definition data refers to facts and statistics.\nCollected together for reference or analysis.\nAll right.\nThis is the definition of data in terms\nof statistics and probability.\nSo as we know data can be collected it\ncan be measured and analyzed\nit can be visualized by using statistical models\nand graphs now data is divided into two major subcategories.\nAlright, so first we have qualitative data\nand quantitative data.\nThese are the two different types of data\nunder qualitative data.\nI'll be have nominal and ordinal data\nand under quantitative data.\nWe have discrete and continuous data.\nNow, let's focus on qualitative data.\nNow this type of data deals with characteristics and descriptors\nthat can't be easily measured\nbut can be observed subjectively\nnow qualitative data is further divided\ninto nominal and ordinal data.\nSo nominal data is any sort of data\nthat doesn't have any order or ranking?\nOkay.\nAn example of nominal data is gender.\nNow.\nThere is no ranking in gender.\nThere's only male female or other right?\nThere is no one two,\nthree four or any sort of ordering in gender race is\nanother example of nominal data.\nNow ordinal data is basically an ordered series of information.\nOkay, let's say that you went to a restaurant.\nOkay.\nYour information is stored in the form of customer ID.\nAll right.\nSo basically you are represented with a customer ID.\nNow you would have rated their service as\neither good or average.\nAll right, that's how no ordinal data is\nand similarly they'll have a record of other customers\nwho visit the restaurant along with their ratings.\nAll right.\nSo any data which has some sort of sequence\nor some sort of order to it is known as ordinal data.\nAll right, so guys,\nthis is pretty simple to understand now,\nlet's move on and look at quantitative data.\nSo quantitative data basically these He's\nwith numbers and things.\nOkay, you can understand\nthat by the word quantitative itself quantitative is\nbasically quantity.\nRight Saudis with numbers a deals with anything\nthat you can measure objectively, right?\nSo there are two types\nof quantitative data there is discrete and continuous data\nnow discrete data is also known as categorical data\nand it can hold a finite number of possible values.\nNow, the number of students in a class is a finite Number.\nAll right, you can't have infinite number\nof students in a class.\nLet's say in your fifth grade.\nThere were a hundred students in your class.\nAll right, there weren't infinite number but there was\na definite finite number of students in your class.\nOkay, that's discrete data.\nNext.\nWe have continuous data.\nNow this type of data can hold infinite number\nof possible values.\nOkay.\nSo when you say weight of a person is an example\nof continuous data\nwhat I mean to see is my weight can be 50 kgs\nor it Can be 50.1 kgs\nor it can be 50.00 one kgs or 50.000 one or is 50.0 2 3\nand so on right?\nThere are infinite number of possible values, right?\nSo this is what I mean by continuous data.\nAll right.\nThis is the difference between discrete and continuous data.\nAnd also I would like to mention a few other things over here.\nNow, there are a couple of types of variables as well.\nWe have a discrete variable\nand we have a continuous variable discrete variable\nis also known as a categorical variable\nor and it can hold values of different categories.\nLet's say that you have a variable called message\nand there are two types of values that this variable\ncan hold let's say\nthat your message can either be a Spam message\nor a non spam message.\nOkay, that's when you call a variable as discrete\nor categorical variable.\nAll right, because it can hold values\nthat represent different categories of data\nnow continuous variables are basically variables\nthat can store in finite number of values.\nSo the weight of a person can be denoted as\na continuous variable.\nAll right, let's say there is a variable called weight\nand it can store infinite number of possible values.\nThat's why we'll call it a continuous variable.\nSo guys basically variable is anything\nthat can store a value right?\nSo if you associate any sort of data with a A table,\nthen it will become either discrete variable\nor continuous variable.\nThere is also dependent and independent type of variables.\nNow, we won't discuss all with that in depth because\nthat's pretty understandable.\nI'm sure all of you know,\nwhat is independent variable and dependent variable right?\nDependent variable is any variable whose value\ndepends on any other independent variable?\nSo guys that much knowledge I expect or\nif you do have all right.\nSo now let's move on and look at our next topic which Which is\nwhat is statistics now coming to the formal definition\nof statistics statistics is an area of Applied Mathematics,\nwhich is concerned\nwith data collection analysis interpretation\nand presentation now usually\nwhen I speak about statistics people think statistics is\nall about analysis\nbut statistics has other path toward it has data collection is\nalso part of Statistics data interpretation presentation.\nAll of this comes\ninto statistics already are going to use statistical methods\nto visualize data to collect data to interpret data.\nAlright, so the area of mathematics deals\nwith understanding\nhow data can be used to solve complex problems.\nOkay.\nNow I'll give you a couple of examples\nthat can be solved by using statistics.\nOkay, let's say\nthat your company has created a new drug\nthat may cure cancer.\nHow would you conduct a test to confirm\nthe As Effectiveness now,\neven though this sounds like a biology problem.\nThis can be solved with Statistics.\nAll right, you will have to create a test\nwhich can confirm the effectiveness of the drum\nor a this is a common problem\nthat can be solved using statistics.\nLet me give you another example you\nand a friend are at a baseball game and out of the blue.\nHe offers you a bet\nthat neither team will hit a home run in that game.\nShould you take the BET?\nAll right here you just discuss the probability\nof I know you'll win or lose.\nAll right, this is another problem\nthat comes under statistics.\nLet's look at another example.\nThe latest sales data has just come in\nand your boss wants you to prepare a report\nfor management on places\nwhere the company could improve its business.\nWhat should you look for?\nAnd what should you not look for now?\nThis problem involves a lot\nof data analysis will have to look at the different variables\nthat are causing your business to go down\nor the you have to look at a few variables.\nThat are increasing the performance of your models\nand does growing your business.\nAlright, so this involves a lot of data analysis\nand the basic idea\nbehind data analysis is to use statistical techniques\nin order to figure out the relationship\nbetween different variables\nor different components in your business.\nOkay.\nSo now let's move on and look\nat our next topic which is basic terminologies and statistics.\nNow before you dive deep into statistics, it is important\nthat you understand the basic terminologies\nused in statistics.\nThe two most important terminologies in statistics\nare population and Sample.\nSo throughout the statistics course or throughout any problem\nthat you're trying to stall with Statistics.\nYou will come across these two words,\nwhich is population and Sample Now population is a collection\nor a set of individuals or objects or events.\nEvents whose properties are to be analyzed.\nOkay.\nSo basically you can refer to population as a subject\nthat you're trying to analyze now a sample is just\nlike the word suggests.\nIt's a subset of the population.\nSo you have to make sure that you choose the sample\nin such a way\nthat it represents the entire population.\nAll right.\nIt shouldn't Focus add one part of the population instead.\nIt should represent the entire population.\nThat's how your sample should be chosen.\nSo Well chosen sample will contain most\nof the information about a particular population parameter.\nNow, you must be wondering how can one choose a sample\nthat best represents the entire population now\nsampling is a statistical method\nthat deals with the selection of individual observations\nwithin a population.\nSo sampling is performed\nin order to infer statistical knowledge about a population.\nAll right, if you want to understand\nthe different statistics of a population\nlike the mean\nthe median Median the mode or the standard deviation\nor the variance of a population.\nThen you're going to perform sampling.\nAll right,\nbecause it's not reasonable for you to study a large population\nand find out the mean median and everything else.\nSo why is sampling performed you might ask?\nWhat is the point of sampling?\nWe can just study the entire population now guys,\nthink of a scenario\nwhere in you're asked to perform a survey\nabout the eating habits of teenagers in the US.\nSo at present there are over 42 million teens in the US\nand this number is growing\nas we are speaking right now, correct.\nIs it possible to survey each of these 42 million individuals\nabout their health?\nIs it possible?\nWell, it might be possible\nbut this will take forever to do now.\nObviously, it's not it's not reasonable to go around\nknocking each door\nand asking for what does your teenage son eat\nand all of that right?\nThis is not very reasonable.\nThat's Why sampling is used?\nIt's a method wherein a sample of the population is studied\nin order to draw inferences about the entire population.\nSo it's basically a shortcut to starting\nthe entire population instead of taking the entire population\nand finding out all the solutions.\nYou just going to take a part of the population\nthat represents the entire population\nand you're going to perform all your statistical analysis\nyour inferential statistics on that small sample.\nAll right,\nand that sample basically here Presents the entire population.\nAll right, so I'm sure have made this clear\nto you all what is sample and what is population now?\nThere are two main types of sampling techniques\nthat are discussed today.\nWe have probability sampling and non-probability\nsampling now in this video\nwill only be focusing on probability sampling techniques\nbecause non-probability sampling is not within the scope\nof this video.\nAll right will only discuss the probability part\nbecause we're focusing\non Statistics and probability correct.\nNow again under probability sampling.\nWe have three different types.\nWe have random sampling systematic\nand stratified sampling.\nAll right, and just to mention the different types\nof non-probability\nsampling zwi have no ball Kota judgment\nand convenience sampling.\nAll right now guys in this session.\nI'll only be focusing on probability.\nSo let's move on\nand look at the different types of probability sampling.\nSo what is Probability sampling.\nIt is a sampling technique\nin which samples from a large population\nare chosen by using the theory of probability.\nAll right, so there are three types\nof probability sampling.\nAll right first we have the random sampling now\nin this method each member\nof the population has an equal chance\nof being selected in the sample.\nAll right.\nSo each and every individual or each and every object\nin the population has an equal chance\nof being a A part of the sample.\nThat's what random sampling is all about.\nOkay, you are randomly going to select any individual\nor any object.\nSo this Bay each individual has\nan equal chance of being selected.\nCorrect?\nNext.\nWe have systematic sampling now\nin systematic sampling every nth record is chosen\nfrom the population to be a part of the sample.\nAll right.\nNow refer this image\nthat I've shown over here out of these six groups\nevery Skinned group is chosen as a sample.\nOkay.\nSo every second record is chosen here and this is\nour systematic sampling works.\nOkay, you're randomly selecting the nth record\nand you're going to add that to your sample.\nNext.\nWe have stratified sampling.\nNow in this type\nof technique a stratum is used to form samples\nfrom a large population.\nSo what is a stratum a stratum is basically a subset\nof the population\nthat shares at least one comment.\nCharacteristics so let's say\nthat your population has a mix of both male and female\nso you can create to straightens\nout of this one will have only the male subset\nand the other will have the female subset\nor a this is what stratum is it is basically a subset\nof the population\nthat shares at least one common characteristics.\nAll right in our example, it is gender.\nSo after you've created\na stratum you're going to use random sampling\non the stratums and you're going to choose a final Samba.\nBut so random sampling meaning\nthat all of the individuals\nin each of the stratum will have an equal chance\nof being selected in the sample, correct.\nSo Guys, these were the three different types\nof sampling techniques.\nNow, let's move on and look at our next topic\nwhich is the different types of Statistics.\nSo after this,\nwe'll be looking at the more advanced concepts of Statistics,\nright so far we discuss the basics of Statistics,\nwhich is basically\nwhat is statistics the different sampling.\nTechniques and the terminologies and statistics.\nAll right.\nNow we look at the different types of Statistics.\nSo there are two major types of Statistics\ndescriptive statistics\nand inferential statistics in today's session.\nWe will be discussing both of these types\nof Statistics in depth.\nAll right, we'll also be looking at a demo\nwhich I'll be running in the our language\nin order to make you understand what exactly\ndescriptive and inferential statistics is so guys,\nwhich is going to look at the 600 don't worry,\nif you don't have much knowledge,\nI'm explaining everything from the basic level.\nAll right, so guys descriptive statistics is a method\nwhich is used to describe and understand the features\nof specific data set by giving a short summary of the data.\nOkay, so it is mainly\nfocused upon the characteristics of data.\nIt also provides a graphical summary of the data now\nin order to make you understand what descriptive statistics is,\nlet's suppose.\nPose that you want to gift all your classmates or t-shirt.\nSo to study the average shirt size of a student\nin a classroom.\nSo if you were to use descriptive statistics to study\nthe average shirt size of students in your classroom,\nthen what you would do is you would record the shirt size\nof all students in the class\nand then you would find out the maximum minimum and average\nshirt size of the club.\nOkay.\nSo coming to inferential statistics inferential\nstatistics makes Is\nand predictions about a population based\non the sample of data taken from the population?\nOkay.\nSo in simple words,\nit generalizes a large data set and it applies probability\nto draw a conclusion.\nOkay.\nSo it allows you to infer data parameters\nbased on a statistical model by using sample data.\nSo if we consider the same example of finding\nthe average shirt size of students in a class\nin infinite shal statistics,\nyou will take a sample.\nAll set of the class\nwhich is basically a few people from the entire class.\nAll right, you already have had grouped the class\ninto large medium and small.\nAll right in this method you basically build\na statistical model\nand expand it for the entire population in the class.\nSo guys, there was a brief understanding of descriptive\nand inferential statistics.\nSo that's the difference between descriptive\nand inferential now in the next section,\nwe will go in depth about descriptive statistics.\nAll right, so,\nThat's a discuss more about descriptive statistics.\nSo like I mentioned\nearlier descriptive statistics is a method\nthat is used to describe and understand the features\nof a specific data set by giving short summaries about the sample\nand measures of the data.\nThere are two important measures in descriptive statistics.\nWe have measure of central tendency,\nwhich is also known as measure\nof center and we have measures of variability.\nThis is also known as measures of spread.\nEd so measures of center include mean median and mode now\nwhat is measures\nof center measures of the center are statistical measures\nthat represent the summary of a data set?\nOkay, the three main measures of center are mean median\nand mode coming to measures of variability\nor measures of spread.\nWe have range interquartile range variance\nand standard deviation.\nAll right.\nSo now let's discuss each\nof these measures in a little more.\nUp starting with the measures of center.\nNow.\nI'm sure all of you know what the mean is mean is basically\nthe measure of the average of all the values in a sample.\nOkay, so it's basically the average of all\nthe values in a sample.\nHow do you measure the mean I hope all of you know\nhow the main is measured\nif there are 10 numbers\nand you want to find the mean of these 10 numbers.\nAll you have to do is you have to add up all the 10 numbers\nand you have to divide it by 10 then here\nrepresents the Number of samples in your data set.\nAll right, since we have 10 numbers,\nwe're going to divide this by 10.\nAll right, this will give us the average\nor the mean so to better understand the measures\nof central tendency.\nLet's look at an example.\nNow the data set over here is basically the cars data set\nand it contains a few variables.\nAll right, it has something known as cars.\nIt has mileage\nper gallon cylinder type displacement horsepower\nand roll axle ratio.\nAll right, all of these measures are related to cars.\nOkay.\nSo what you're going to do is you're going\nto use descriptive analysis\nand you're going to analyze each of the variables\nin the sample data set\nfor the mean standard deviation median mode and so on.\nSo let's say that you want to find out the mean\nor the average horsepower\nof the cars among the population of cards.\nLike I mentioned earlier\nwhat you'll do is you will check the average of all the values.\nSo in this case,\nwe will take the sum of the horizontal.\nHorsepower of each car\nand we'll divide that by the total number of cards.\nOkay, that's exactly\nwhat I've done here in the calculation part.\nSo this hundred and ten basically\nrepresents the horsepower for the first car.\nAlright, similarly.\nI've just added up all the values of horsepower\nfor each of the cars\nand I've divided it by 8 now 8 is basically the number\nof cars in our data set.\nAll right, so hundred and three point six two five is what\nour mean is or Average of horsepower is all right.\nNow, let's understand what median is with an example?\nOkay.\nSo to Define median median is basically a measure\nof the central value\nof the sample set is called the median.\nAll right, you can see that it is a middle value.\nSo if we want to find out the center value\nof the mileage per gallon among the population\nof cars first,\nwhat we'll do is we'll arrange the MGP values in ascending\nor descending order\nand Choose a middle value right in this case\nsince we have eight values, right?\nWe have eight values which is an even entry.\nSo whenever you have even number of data points\nor samples in your data set,\nthen you're going to take the average\nof the two middle values.\nIf we had nine values over here.\nWe can easily figure out the middle value\nand you know choose that as a median.\nBut since they're even number of values we're going\nto take the average of the two middle values.\nAll right, so,\nEight and twenty three are my two middle values\nand I'm taking the mean of those 2\nand hence I get twenty two point nine,\nwhich is my median.\nAll right.\nLastly let's look at how mode is calculated.\nSo what is mode the value\nthat is most recurrent\nin the sample set is known as mode or basically the value\nthat occurs most often.\nOkay, that is known as mode.\nSo let's say\nthat we want to find out the most common type of cylinder\namong the population\nof cards all we have to Do is we will check the value\nwhich is repeated the most number of times here.\nWe can see that the cylinders come in two types.\nWe have cylinder of Type 4 and cylinder of type 6, right?\nSo take a look at the data set.\nYou can see that the most recurring value is 6 right.\nWe have one two, three four and five.\nWe have five six and we have one two, three.\nYeah, we have three four types of lenders and 5/6.\nCylinders.\nSo basically we have\nthree four type cylinders and we have five six type cylinders.\nAll right.\nSo our mode is going to be 6 since 6 is more\nrecurrent than 4 so guys\nthose were the measures\nof the center or the measures of central tendency.\nNow, let's move on and look at the measures of the spread.\nAll right.\nNow, what is the measure of spread a measure of spread?\nSometimes also called\nas measure of dispersion is used to describe the The variability\nin a sample or population.\nOkay, you can think of it as some sort\nof deviation in the sample.\nAll right.\nSo you measure this\nwith the help of the different measure of spreads.\nWe have range interquartile range variance\nand standard deviation.\nNow range is pretty self-explanatory, right?\nIt is the given measure of how spread apart the values\nin a data set are the range can be calculated\nas shown in this formula.\nSo you're basically going to The maximum value\nin your data set\nfrom the minimum value in your data set.\nThat's how you calculate the range of the data.\nAlright, next we have interquartile range.\nSo before we discuss interquartile range,\nlet's understand.\nWhat a quartile is red.\nSo quartiles basically tell us about the spread of a data set\nby breaking the data set into different quarters.\nOkay, just like\nhow the median breaks the data into two parts.\nThe quartile will break it.\nIn two different quarters,\nso to better understand how quartile and\ninterquartile are calculated.\nLet's look at a small example.\nNow this data set basically represents the marks\nof hundred students ordered from the lowest\nto the highest scores red.\nSo the quartiles lie\nin the following ranges the first quartile,\nwhich is also known as q1 it\nlies between the 25th and 26th observation.\nAll right.\nSo if you look at this I've highlighted the 25th\nand the Six observation.\nSo how you can calculate Q 1 or first quartile is\nby taking the average of these two values.\nAlright, since both the values are 45\nwhen you add them up and divide them by two\nyou'll still get 45 now the second quartile\nor Q 2 is between the 50th and the fifty first observation.\nSo you're going to take the average of 58\nand 59 and you will get a value of 58.5 now,\nthis is my second quarter the third quartile Q3.\nIs between the 75th\nand the 76th observation here again will take the average\nof the two values\nwhich is the 75th value and the 76 value right\nand you'll get a value of 71.\nAll right, so guys this is exactly\nhow you calculate the different quarters.\nNow, let's look at what is interquartile range.\nSo IQR or the interquartile range is a measure\nof variability based on dividing a data set into quartiles.\nNow, the interquartile range is Calculated\nby subtracting the q1 from Q3.\nSo basically Q3\nminus q1 is your IQ are so your IQR is your Q3 minus q1?\nAll right.\nNow this is how each\nof the quartiles are each core tile represents a quarter,\nwhich is 25% All right.\nSo guys, I hope all of you are clear\nwith the interquartile range and what our quartiles now,\nlet's look at variance covariance is\nbasically a measure that shows how much a\nI'm variable the first from its expected value.\nOkay.\nIt's basically the variance in any variable now variance\ncan be calculated by using this formula right here x\nbasically represents any data point in your data set\nn is the total number of data points in your data set\nand X bar is basically the mean of data points.\nAll right.\nThis is how you calculate variance variance is\nbasically a Computing the squares of deviations.\nOkay.\nThat's why it says s Square there now.\nLook at what is deviation deviation is just the difference\nbetween each element from the mean.\nOkay, so it can be calculated by using this simple formula\nwhere X I basically represents a data point\nand mu is the mean of the population\nor add this is exactly\nhow you calculate the deviation Now population variance\nand Sample variance are very specific to\nwhether you're calculating the variance\nin your population data set or in your sample data\nset now the only difference between Elation\nand Sample variance.\nSo the formula\nfor population variance is pretty explanatory.\nSo X is basically each data point mu is the mean\nof the population\nn is the number of samples in your data set.\nAll right.\nNow, let's look at sample.\nVariance Now sample variance\nis the average of squared differences from the mean.\nAll right here x i is any data point\nor any sample in your data set X bar is the mean\nof your sample.\nAll right.\nIt's not the main of your population.\nIt's the If your sample and\nif you notice any here is a smaller n is the number\nof data points in your sample.\nAnd this is basically the difference between sample\nand population variance.\nI hope that is clear coming\nto standard deviation is the measure of dispersion\nof a set of data from its mean.\nAll right, so it's basically the deviation from your mean.\nThat's what standard deviation is now to better understand\nhow the measures of spread are calculated.\nLet's look at a small use case.\nSo let's say the Daenerys has 20 dragons.\nThey have the numbers nine to five four and so on\nas shown on the screen,\nwhat you have to do is you have to work out\nthe standard deviation or at\nin order to calculate the standard deviation.\nYou need to know the mean right?\nSo first you're going to find out the mean of your sample set.\nSo how do you calculate the mean you add all the numbers\nin your data set\nand divided by the total number of samples in your data set\nso you get a value of 7 here\nthen you I'll clear the rhs of your standard deviation formula.\nAll right, so from each data point you're going\nto subtract the mean and you're going to square that.\nAll right.\nSo when you do that,\nyou will get the following result.\nYou'll basically get this 425 for 925\nand so on so finally you will just find the mean\nof the squared differences.\nAll right.\nSo your standard deviation\nwill come up to two point nine eight three\nonce you take the square root.\nSo guys, this is pretty simple.\nIt's a simple mathematic technique.\nAll you have to do is you have to substitute the values\nin the formula.\nAll right.\nI hope this was clear to all of you.\nNow let's move on\nand discuss the next topic which is Information Gain\nand entropy now.\nThis is one of my favorite topics in statistics.\nIt's very interesting and this topic is mainly involved\nin machine learning algorithms,\nlike decision trees and random forest.\nAll right, it's very important\nfor you to know\nhow Information Gain and entropy really work and why they are\nso essential in building machine learning models.\nWe focus on the statistic parts of Information Gain and entropy\nand after that we'll discuss As a use case and see\nhow Information Gain\nand entropy is used in decision trees.\nSo for those of you\nwho don't know what a decision tree is it is\nbasically a machine learning algorithm.\nYou don't have to know anything about this.\nI'll explain everything in depth.\nSo don't worry.\nNow.\nLet's look at what exactly entropy and Information Gain Is\nAs entropy is basically the measure\nof any sort of uncertainty that is present in the data.\nAll right, so it can be measured by using this formula.\nSo here s is the set of all instances in the data set\nor although data items in the data set\nn is the different type\nof classes in your data set Pi is the event probability.\nNow this might seem a little confusing\nto you all but when we go to the use case,\nyou'll understand all of these terms even better.\nAll right cam.\nTo Information Gain\nas the word suggests Information Gain indicates\nhow much information a particular feature\nor a particular variable gives us about the final outcome.\nOkay, it can be measured by using this formula.\nSo again here hedge of s is the entropy\nof the whole data set s SJ is the number\nof instances with the J value\nof an attribute a s is the total number of instances\nin the data set V is the set\nof distinct values of an attribute a hedge\nof SJ is the entropy of subsets of instances\nand hedge of a comma s is the entropy of an attribute\na even though this seems confusing.\nI'll clear out the confusion.\nAll right, let's discuss a small problem statement\nwhere we will understand\nhow Information Gain\nand entropy is used to study the significance of a model.\nSo like I said Information Gain\nand entropy are very important statistical measures\nthat let us understand\nthe significance of a predictive model.\nOkay to get a more clear understanding.\nLet's look at a use case.\nAll right now suppose we are given a problem statement.\nAll right, the statement is that you have to predict\nwhether a match can be played\nor Not by studying the weather conditions.\nSo the predictor variables here are outlook humidity wind day\nis also a predictor variable.\nThe target variable is basically played already.\nThe target variable is the variable\nthat you're trying to protect.\nOkay.\nNow the value of the target variable will decide\nwhether or not a game can be played.\nAll right, so that's why The play has two values.\nIt has no and yes, no,\nmeaning that the weather conditions are not good.\nAnd therefore you cannot play the game.\nYes, meaning that the weather conditions are good and suitable\nfor you to play the game.\nAlright, so that was a problem statement.\nI hope the problem statement is clear to all of you now\nto solve such a problem.\nWe make use of something known as decision trees.\nSo guys think of an inverted tree\nand each branch of the tree denotes some decision.\nAll right, each branch is Is known as the branch node\nand at each branch node,\nyou're going to take a decision in such a manner\nthat you will get an outcome at the end of the branch.\nAll right.\nNow this figure here basically shows\nthat out of 14 observations 9 observations result in a yes,\nmeaning that out of 14 days.\nThe match can be played only on nine days.\nAlright, so here\nif you see on day 1 Day 2 Day 8 day 9 and 11.\nThe Outlook has been Alright,\nso basically we try to plaster a data set\ndepending on the Outlook.\nSo when the Outlook is sunny,\nthis is our data set when the Outlook is overcast.\nThis is what we have\nand when the Outlook is the rain this is what we have.\nAll right, so\nwhen it is sunny we have two yeses and three nodes.\nOkay, when the Outlook is overcast.\nWe have all four as yes has meaning\nthat on the four days when the Outlook was overcast.\nWe can play the game.\nAll right.\nNow when it comes to drain,\nwe have three yeses and two nodes.\nAll right.\nSo if you notice here,\nthe decision is being made by choosing the Outlook variable\nas the root node.\nOkay.\nSo the root node is\nbasically the topmost node in a decision tree.\nNow, what we've done here is we've created a decision tree\nthat starts with the Outlook node.\nAll right, then you're splitting the decision tree further\ndepending on other parameters like Sunny overcast and rain.\nAll right now like we know that Outlook has three values.\nSunny overcast and brain so let me explain this\nin a more in-depth manner.\nOkay.\nSo what you're doing here is you're making\nthe decision Tree by choosing the Outlook variable\nat the root node.\nThe root note is basically the topmost node\nin a decision tree.\nNow the Outlook node has three branches coming out from it,\nwhich is sunny overcast and rain.\nSo basically Outlook\ncan have three values either it can be sunny.\nIt can be overcast or it can be rainy.\nOkay now these three values Use are assigned\nto the immediate Branch nodes and for each\nof these values the possibility\nof play is equal to yes is calculated.\nSo the sunny\nand the rain branches will give you an impure output.\nMeaning that there is a mix of yes and no right.\nThere are two yeses here three nodes here.\nThere are three yeses here and two nodes over here,\nbut when it comes to the overcast variable,\nit results in a hundred percent pure subset.\nAll right, this shows that the overcast baby.\nWill result in a definite and certain output.\nThis is exactly what entropy is used to measure.\nAll right, it calculates the impurity or the uncertainty.\nAlright, so the lesser the uncertainty or the entropy\nof a variable more significant is that variable?\nSo when it comes to overcast there's literally no impurity\nin the data set.\nIt is a hundred percent pure subset, right?\nSo be want variables like these in order to build a model.\nAll right now,\nwe don't always Ways get lucky and we don't always find\nvariables that will result in pure subsets.\nThat's why we have the measure entropy.\nSo the lesser the entropy of a particular variable the most\nsignificant that variable will be so in a decision tree.\nThe root node is assigned the best attribute\nso that the decision tree can predict the most\nprecise outcome meaning that on the root note.\nYou should have the most significant variable.\nAll right, that's why we've chosen Outlook\nor and now some of you might ask me why haven't you chosen\novercast Okay is overcast is not a variable.\nIt is a value of the Outlook variable.\nAll right.\nThat's why we've chosen outlook here because it has\na hundred percent pure subset which is overcast.\nAll right.\nNow the question in your head is how do I decide which variable\nor attribute best Blitz the data now right now,\nI know I looked at the data\nand I told you that,\nyou know here we have a hundred percent pure subset,\nbut what if it's a more complex problem\nand you're not able to understand which variable\nwill best split the data,\nso guys when it comes\nto decision tree Information and gain\nand entropy will help\nyou understand which variable will best split the data set.\nAll right, or which variable you have to assign to the root node\nbecause whichever variable is assigned to the dude node.\nIt will best let the data set\nand it has to be the most significant variable.\nAll right.\nSo how we can do this is we need to use\nInformation Gain and entropy.\nSo from the total of the 14 instances\nthat we saw nine of them said yes\nand 5 of the instances said know\nthat you cannot play on that particular day.\nAll right.\nSo how do you calculate the entropy?\nSo this is the formula you just substitute\nthe values in the formula.\nSo when you substitute the values in the formula,\nyou will get a value of 0.9940.\nAll right.\nThis is the entropy\nor this is the uncertainty of the data present in a sample.\nNow in order to ensure\nthat we choose the best variable for the root node.\nLet us look at all the possible combinations\nthat you can use on the root node.\nOkay, so these are All the possible combinations\nyou can either have Outlook you can have\nwindy humidity or temperature.\nOkay, these are four variables and you can have any one\nof these variables as your root node.\nBut how do you select\nwhich variable best fits the root node?\nThat's what we are going to see by using\nInformation Gain and entropy.\nSo guys now the task at hand is to find the information gain\nfor each of these attributes.\nAll right.\nSo for Outlook for windy for humidity and for temperature,\nwe're going to find out the information.\nNation gained right now a point to remember is\nthat the variable\nthat results in the highest Information Gain must be chosen\nbecause it will give us the most precise and output information.\nAll right.\nSo the information gain for attribute windy will calculate\nthat first here.\nWe have six instances of true and eight instances of false.\nOkay.\nSo when you substitute all the values in the formula,\nyou will get a value of zero point zero four eight.\nSo we get a value of You 2.0 for it.\nNow.\nThis is a very low value for Information Gain.\nAll right, so the information\nthat you're going to get from Windy attribute is pretty low.\nSo let's calculate the information gain\nof attribute Outlook.\nAll right, so from the total of 14 instances,\nwe have five instances with say Sunny for instances,\nwhich are overcast and five instances,\nwhich are rainy.\nAll right for Sonny.\nWe have three yeses and to nose for overcast we have All the\nfor as yes for any we have three years and two nodes.\nOkay.\nSo when you calculate the information gain\nof the Outlook variable will get a value\nof zero point 2 4 7 now compare this to the information gain\nof the windy attribute.\nThis value is actually pretty good.\nRight we have zero point 2 4 7 which is a pretty good value\nfor Information Gain.\nNow, let's look at the information gain\nof attribute humidity now over here.\nWe have seven instances with say hi and seven instances\nwith say normal.\nRight and under the high Branch node.\nWe have three instances with say yes,\nand the rest for instances would say no similarly\nunder the normal Branch.\nWe have one two, three,\nfour, five six seven instances would say yes\nand one instance with says no.\nAll right.\nSo when you calculate the information gain\nfor the humidity variable,\nyou're going to get a value of 0.15 one.\nNow.\nThis is also a pretty decent value,\nbut when you compare it to the Information Gain,\nOf the attribute Outlook it is less right now.\nLet's look at the information gain of attribute temperature.\nAll right, so the temperature can hold repeat.\nSo basically the temperature attribute can hold\nhot mild and cool.\nOkay under hot.\nWe have two instances with says yes and two instances\nfor no under mild.\nWe have four instances of yes and two instances of no\nand under col we have three instances of yes\nand one instance of no.\nAll right.\nWhen you calculate\nthe information gain for this attribute,\nyou will get a value of zero point zero to nine,\nwhich is again very less.\nSo what you can summarize from here is if we look\nat the information gain for each of these variable will see\nthat for Outlook.\nWe have the maximum gain.\nAll right, we have zero point two four seven,\nwhich is the highest Information Gain value\nand you must always choose a variable with the highest\nInformation Gain to split the data at the root node.\nSo that's why we assign The Outlook variable\nat the root node.\nAll right, so guys.\nI hope this use case with clear if any of you have doubts.\nPlease keep commenting those doubts now,\nlet's move on and look at what exactly a confusion Matrix is\nthe confusion Matrix is the last topic\nfor descriptive statistics read after this.\nI'll be running a short demo where I'll be showing you\nhow you can calculate mean median mode\nand standard deviation variance and all of those values\nby using our okay.\nSo let's talk about confusion Matrix now guys.\nWhat is the confusion Matrix now don't get confused.\nThis is not any complex topic now confusion.\nMatrix is a matrix\nthat is often used to describe the performance of a model.\nAll right, and this is specifically used\nfor classification models\nor a classifier\nand what it does is it will calculate the accuracy\nor it will calculate the performance of your classifier\nby comparing your actual results and Your predicted results.\nAll right.\nSo this is what it looks\nlike to positive to negative and all of that.\nNow this is a little confusing.\nI'll get back to what exactly true positive\nto negative and all of this stands for for now.\nLet's look at an example and let's try and understand what\nexactly confusion Matrix is.\nSo guys have made sure\nthat I put examples after each and every topic\nbecause it's important you\nunderstand the Practical part of Statistics.\nAll right statistics has literally nothing to do\nwith Theory you need to understand how Calculations\nare done in statistics.\nOkay.\nSo here what I've done is now let's look at a small use case.\nOkay, let's consider\nthat your given data about a hundred and sixty five\npatients out of which hundred and five patients have a disease\nand the remaining 50 patients don't have a disease.\nOkay.\nSo what you're going to do is you will build a classifier\nthat predicts by using\nthese hundred and sixty five observations.\nYou'll feed all\nof these 165 observations to your classifier\nand it will predict the output every time\na new patients detail is fed to the classifier right now\nout of these 165 cases.\nLet's say that the classifier predicted.\nYes hundred and ten times and no 55 times.\nAlright, so yes basically stands for yes.\nThe person has a disease and no stands for know.\nThe person does not have a disease.\nAll right, that's pretty self-explanatory.\nBut yeah, so it predicted that a hundred and ten times.\nPatient has a disease and 55 times\nthat know the patient doesn't have a disease.\nHowever in reality only hundred and five patients\nin the sample have the disease and 60 patients\nwho do not have the disease, right?\nSo how do you calculate the accuracy of your model?\nYou basically build the confusion Matrix?\nAll right.\nThis is how the Matrix looks\nlike and basically denotes the total number of observations\nthat you have\nwhich is 165 in our case actual denotes the actual use\nin the data set\nand predicted denotes the predicted values\nby the classifier.\nSo the actual value is no here\nand the predicted value is no here.\nSo your classifier was correctly able\nto classify 50 cases as no.\nAll right, since both of these are no so 50\nit was correctly able to classify but 10\nof these cases it incorrectly classified meaning\nthat your actual value here is no but you classifier\npredicted it as yes\nor I that's why this And over here similarly\nit wrongly predicted\nthat five patients do not have diseases\nwhereas they actually did have diseases\nand it correctly predicted hundred patients,\nwhich have the disease.\nAll right.\nI know this is a little bit confusing.\nBut if you look at these values no,\nno 50 meaning\nthat it correctly predicted 50 values No\nYes means that it wrongly predicted.\nYes for the values are it was supposed to predict.\nNo.\nAll right.\nNow what exactly is?\nIs this true positive to negative and all of that?\nI'll tell you what exactly it is.\nSo true positive are the cases in which we predicted a yes\nand they do not actually have the disease.\nAll right, so it is basically this value\nalready predicted a yes here,\neven though they did not have the disease.\nSo we have 10 true positives right similarly true-\nis we predicted know\nand they don't have the disease meaning\nthat this is correct.\nFalse positive is be predicted.\nYes, but they do not actually have the disease\nor at this is also known as type 1 error falls- is we predicted.\nNo, but they actually do not have the disease.\nSo guys basically falls-\nand true negatives are basically correct classifications.\nAll right.\nSo this was confusion Matrix\nand I hope this concept is clear again guys.\nIf you have doubts,\nplease comment your doubt in the comment section.\nSo guys, that was the entire descriptive.\nX module and now we will discuss about probability.\nOkay.\nSo before we understand what exactly probability is,\nlet me clear out a very common misconception people\noften tend to ask me this question.\nWhat is the relationship between statistics and probability?\nSo probability and statistics are related fields.\nAll right.\nSo probability is a mathematical method used\nfor statistical analysis.\nTherefore we can say\nthat a probability and statistics are interconnected.\nLaunches of mathematics\nthat deal with analyzing the relative frequency of events.\nSo they're very interconnected feels\nand probability makes use of statistics\nand statistics makes use\nof probability or a they're very interconnected Fields.\nSo that is the relationship between statistics\nand probability.\nNow, let's understand what exactly is probability.\nSo probability is the measure\nof How likely an event will occur to be more precise.\nIt is the ratio.\nOf desired outcome to the total outcomes.\nNow, the probability\nof all outcomes always sum up to 1 the probability will always\nsum up to 1 probability cannot go beyond one.\nOkay.\nSo either your probability can be 0 or it can be 1\nor it can be in the form of decimals like 0.5\nto or 0.55 or it can be in the form of 0.5 0.7 0.9.\nBut it's valuable always stay between the range 0 and 1.\nOkay at the famous example\nof probability is rolling a dice example.\nSo when you roll a dice you get six possible outcomes, right?\nYou get one two,\nthree four and five six phases of a dice now\neach possibility only has one outcome.\nSo what is the probability that on rolling a dice?\nYou will get 3 the probability is 1 by 6, right\nbecause there's only one phase\nwhich has the number 3 on it out of six phases.\nThere's only one phase which has the number three.\nSo the probability of getting 3\nwhen you roll a dice is 1 by 6 similarly,\nif you want to find the probability of getting\na number 5 again,\nthe probability is going to be 1 by 6.\nAll right, so all of this will sum up to 1.\nAll right, so guys this is exactly what probability is.\nIt's a very simple concept we all learnt it\nin 8 standard onwards right now.\nLet's understand the different terminologies\nthat are related to probability.\nNow the three terminologies that you often come across\nwhen We talk about probability.\nWe have something known as the random experiment.\nOkay, it's basically an experiment or a process\nfor which the outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty.\nAll right.\nThat's why you use probability.\nYou're going to use probability in order to predict the outcome\nwith some sort\nof certainty sample space is the entire possible set\nof outcomes of a random experiment an event is\none or more outcomes of an experiment.\nSo if you consider the example Love rolling a dice.\nNow.\nLet's say that you want to find out the probability\nof getting a to when you roll the dice.\nOkay.\nSo finding this probability is the random experiment\nthe sample space is basically your entire possibility.\nOkay.\nSo one two, three, four,\nfive six phases are there and out of that you need\nto find the probability of getting a 2, right.\nSo all the possible outcomes\nwill basically represent your sample space.\nOkay.\nSo 1 to 6 are all your possible outcomes this represents.\nSample space event is one or more outcome\nof an experiment.\nSo in this case my event is to get a to\nwhen I roll a dice, right?\nSo my event is the probability of getting a to\nwhen I roll a dice.\nSo guys, this is basically what random experiment sample space\nand event really means alright.\nNow, let's discuss the different types of events.\nThere are two types of events that you should know about there\nis disjoint and non disjoint events disjoint events.\nThese are events\nthat do not have any common outcome.\nFor example,\nif you draw a single card from a deck of cards,\nit cannot be a king and a queen correct.\nIt can either be king or it can be Queen.\nNow a non disjoint events are events\nthat have common outcomes.\nFor example, a student can get hundred marks\nin statistics and hundred marks in probability.\nAll right, and also the outcome\nof a ball delibird can be a no ball\nand it can be a 6 right.\nSo this is Non disjoint events are or n.\nThese are very simple to understand right now.\nLet's move on and look at the different types\nof probability distribution.\nAll right, I'll be discussing\nthe three main probability distribution functions.\nI'll be talking about probability density\nfunction normal distribution and Central limit theorem.\nOkay probability density function also known\nas PDF is concerned\nwith the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable.\nTo take on a given value.\nAll right.\nSo the PDF gives the probability\nof a variable that lies between the range A and B.\nSo basically what you're trying to do is you're going to try\nand find the probability of a continuous random variable\nover a specified range.\nOkay.\nNow this graph denotes the PDF of a continuous variable.\nNow, this graph is also known as the bell curve right?\nIt's famously called the bell curve because of\nits shape and there are three important properties\nthat you To know about a probability density function.\nNow the graph of a PDF will be continuous over a range.\nThis is because you're finding the probability\nthat a continuous variable lies between the ranges A and B,\nright the second property is\nthat the area bounded by the curve of a density function\nand the x-axis is equal to 1 basically the area\nbelow the curve is equal to 1 all right,\nbecause it denotes probability again\nthe probability cannot arrange.\nMore than one it has to be\nbetween 0 and 1 property number three is that the probability\nthat our random variable assumes a value between A\nand B is equal to the area\nunder the PDF bounded by A and B. Okay.\nNow what this means is\nthat the probability value is denoted by the area\nof the graph.\nAll right, so whatever value that you get here,\nwhich basically one is the probability\nthat a random variable will lie between the range A and B.\nAll right, so I hope\nIf you have understood the probability density function,\nit's basically the probability of finding the value\nof a continuous random variable between the range A and B.\nAll right.\nNow, let's look at our next distribution,\nwhich is normal distribution now normal distribution,\nwhich is also known as\nthe gaussian distribution is a probability distribution\nthat denotes the symmetric property\nof the mean right meaning\nthat the idea behind this function is\nthat The data near the mean\noccurs more frequently than the data away from the mean.\nSo what it means to say is\nthat the data around the mean represents the entire data set.\nOkay.\nSo if you just take a sample of data\naround the mean it can represent the entire data set now similar\nto the probability density function the normal distribution\nappears as a bell curve.\nAll right.\nNow when it comes to normal distribution,\nthere are two important factors.\nAll right, we have the mean of the population.\nAnd the standard deviation.\nOkay, so the mean and the graph determines the location\nof the center of the graph,\nright and the standard deviation determines the height\nof the graph.\nOkay.\nSo if the standard deviation is large the curve is going\nto look something like this.\nAll right, it'll be short and wide and\nif the standard deviation is small the curve\nis tall and narrow.\nAll right.\nSo this was it about normal distribution.\nNow, let's look at the central limit theorem.\nNow the central limit theorem states\nthat the sampling distribution\nof the mean of any independent random variable will be normal\nor nearly normal\nif the sample size is large enough now,\nthat's a little confusing.\nOkay.\nLet me break it down for you now in simple terms\nif we had a large population\nand we divided it into many samples.\nThen the mean of all the samples\nfrom the population will be almost equal\nto the mean of the entire population right meaning\nthat each of the sample is normally distributed.\nRight.\nSo if you compare the mean of each of the sample,\nit will almost be equal to the mean of the population.\nRight?\nSo this graph basically shows a more clear understanding\nof the central limit theorem red you can see each sample here\nand the mean\nof each sample is almost along the same line, right?\nOkay.\nSo this is exactly\nwhat the central limit theorem States now the accuracy\nor the resemblance\nto the normal distribution depends on two main factors.\nRight.\nSo the first is the number of sample points\nthat you consider.\nAll right,\nand the second is a shape of the underlying population.\nNow the shape obviously depends on the standard deviation\nand the mean of a sample, correct.\nSo guys the central limit theorem basically states\nthat each sample will be normally distributed\nin such a way\nthat the mean of each sample will coincide with the mean\nof the actual population.\nAll right in short terms.\nThat's what central limit theorem States.\nAlright, and this holds true only for a large.\nIs it mostly for a small data set\nand there are more deviations\nwhen compared to a large data set is because of\nthe scaling Factor, right?\nThe small is deviation\nin a small data set will change the value very drastically,\nbut in a large data set a small deviation\nwill not matter at all.\nNow, let's move on and look at our next topic\nwhich is the different types of probability.\nNow, this is a important topic\nbecause most of your problems can be solved by understanding\nwhich type of probability should I use to solve?\nThis problem right?\nSo we have three important types of probability.\nWe have marginal joint and conditional probability.\nSo let's discuss each\nof these now the probability of an event occurring unconditioned\non any other event is known as marginal probability\nor unconditional probability.\nSo let's say that you want to find the probability\nthat a card drawn is a heart.\nAll right.\nSo if you want to find the probability\nthat a card drawn is a heart the prophet.\nB13 by 52 since there are 52 cards in a deck\nand there are 13 hearts in a deck of cards.\nRight and there are 52 cards in a turtleneck.\nSo your marginal probability will be 13 by 52.\nThat's about marginal probability.\nNow, let's understand.\nWhat is joint probability.\nNow joint probability\nis a measure of two events happening at the same time.\nOkay.\nLet's say that the two events are A and B.\nSo the probability of event A\nand B occurring is the dissection of A and B.\nSo for example,\nif you want to find the probability\nthat a card is a four and a red that would be joint probability.\nAll right, because you're finding a card\nthat is 4 and the card has to be red in color.\nSo for the answer,\nthis will be 2 by 52 because we have 1/2\nin heart and we have 1/2 and diamonds correct.\nSo both of these are red and color therefore.\nOur probability is to by 52\nand if you further down it Is 1 by 26, right?\nSo this is what joint probability is all\nabout moving on.\nLet's look at what exactly conditional probability is.\nSo if the probability\nof an event or an outcome is based on the occurrence\nof a previous event or an outcome,\nthen you call it as a conditional probability.\nOkay.\nSo the conditional probability of an event B is the probability\nthat the event will occur given\nthat an event a has already occurred, right?\nSo if a and b are dependent events,\nthen the expression\nfor conditional probability is given by this.\nNow this first term on the left hand side,\nwhich is p b of a is basically the probability\nof event B occurring\ngiven that event a has already occurred.\nAll right.\nSo like I said,\nif a and b are dependent events,\nthen this is the expression but if a\nand b are independent events,\nand the expression for conditional probability is\nlike this, right?\nSo guys P of A and B of B is obviously the probability of A\nand probability of B right now.\nLet's move on now in order\nto understand conditional probability joint probability\nand marginal probability.\nLet's look at a small use case.\nOkay now basically we're going to take a data set\nwhich examines the salary package and training\nundergone my candidates.\nOkay.\nNow in this there are 60 candidates without training\nand forty five candidates,\nwhich have enrolled for Adder a curse training.\nRight.\nNow the task here is you have to assess the training\nwith a salary package.\nOkay, let's look at this in a little more depth.\nSo in total,\nwe have hundred and five candidates out of which 60\nof them have not enrolled Frederick has training\nand 45 of them have enrolled for a deer Acres training\nor this is a small survey\nthat was conducted\nand this is the rating of the package or the salary\nthat they got right?\nSo if you read through the data,\nyou can understand there were five candidates.\nIt's without education\nor training who got a very poor salary package.\nOkay.\nSimilarly, there are\n30 candidates with Ed Eureka training\nwho got a good package, right?\nSo guys basically you're comparing the salary package\nof a person depending on\nwhether or not they've enrolled for a director training, right?\nThis is our data set.\nNow, let's look at our problem statement find the probability\nthat a candidate has undergone a Drake\nhas training quite simple,\nwhich type of probability is this Is this is\nmarginal probability?\nRight?\nSo the probability\nthat a candidate has undergone edger Acres training is\nobviously 45 divided by a hundred and five\nsince 45 is the number\nof candidates with Eddie record raining\nand hundred and five is the total number of candidates.\nSo you get a value of approximately 0.4\nto all right,\nthat's the probability of a candidate\nthat has undergone educate a girl straining next question\nfind the probability\nthat a candidate has attended edger Acres training.\nAlso has good package.\nNow.\nThis is obviously a joint probability problem, right?\nSo how do you calculate this now?\nSince our table is quite formatted we can directly find\nthat people who have gotten a good package\nalong with Eddie record raining or 30, right?\nSo out of hundred and five people 30 people\nhave education training and a good package, right?\nThey specifically asking for people\nwith Eddie record raining.\nRemember that night.\nThe question is find the probability that a gang Today,\nit has attended editor Acres training\nand also has a good package.\nAll right, so we need to consider two factors\nthat is a candidate\nwho's addenda deaderick has training and\nwho has a good package.\nSo clearly that number\nis 30 30 divided by total number of candidates,\nwhich is 1:05, right?\nSo here you get the answer clearly next.\nWe have find the probability\nthat a candidate has a good package given\nthat he has not undergone training.\nOkay.\nNow this is Early conditional probability\nbecause here you're defining a condition you're saying\nthat you want to find the probability of a candidate\nwho has a good package given that he's not undergone.\nAny training, right?\nThe condition is that he's not undergone any training.\nAll right.\nSo the number of people\nwho have not undergone training are 60 and out\nof that five of them have got a good package\nthat so that's why this is Phi by 60 and not five\nby a hundred and five\nbecause here they have clearly mentioned has a good pack.\nGiven that he has not undergone training.\nSo you have to only\nconsider people who have not undergone training, right?\nSo any five people\nwho have not undergone training have gotten\na good package, right?\nSo 5 divided by 60 you get a probability of around 0.08\nwhich is pretty low, right?\nOkay.\nSo this was all\nabout the different types of probability now,\nlet's move on and look at our last Topic in probability,\nwhich is base theorem.\nNow guys base.\nYour room is a very important concept when it comes\nto statistics and probability.\nIt is majorly used in knife bias algorithm.\nThose of you who aren't aware.\nNow I've bias is a supervised learning classification\nalgorithm and it is mainly used in Gmail spam filtering right?\nA lot of you might have noticed that if you open up Gmail,\nyou'll see that you have a folder called spam right\nor that is carried out through machine learning\nand And the algorithm use there is knife bias, right?\nSo now let's discuss what exactly the Bayes theorem is\nand what it denotes the bias theorem is used\nto show the relation between one conditional probability\nand it's inverse.\nAll right.\nBasically it's nothing but the probability\nof an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions\nthat might be related to the same event.\nOkay.\nSo mathematically the bell's theorem is represented\nlike this right now.\nShown in this equation.\nThe left-hand term is referred to as the likelihood ratio\nwhich measures the probability\nof occurrence of event be given an event a okay\non the left hand side is\nwhat is known as the posterior right\nis referred to as posterior,\nwhich means that the probability\nof occurrence of a given an event be right.\nThe second term is referred\nto as the likelihood Ratio or at this measures the probability\nof occurrence of B given an event.\nA now P of a is also known as the prior\nwhich refers to the actual probability distribution of A\nand P of B is again,\nthe probability of B, right.\nThis is the bias theorem\nand in order to better understand the base theorem.\nLet's look at a small example.\nLet's say that we have three bowels we have bow is\na bow will be and bouncy.\nOkay barley contains two blue balls\nand for red balls bowel B\ncontains eight blue balls and for red balls.\nWow Zeke.\nGames one blue ball and three red balls now\nif we draw one ball from each Bowl,\nwhat is the probability to draw a blue ball\nfrom a bowel a if we know\nthat we drew exactly a total of two blue balls, right?\nIf you didn't understand the question,\nplease read it I shall pause for a second or two.\nRight.\nSo I hope all of you have understood the question.\nOkay.\nNow what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw\na blueprint for you\nand tell you how exactly to solve the problem.\nBut I want you all to give me the solution\nto this problem, right?\nI'll draw a blueprint.\nI'll tell you what exactly the steps are\nbut I want you to come up with a solution\non your own right the formula is also given to you.\nEverything is given to you.\nAll you have to do is come up with the final answer.\nRight?\nLet's look at how you can solve this problem.\nSo first of all,\nwhat we will do is Let's consider a all right,\nlet a be the event\nof picking a blue ball from bag in and let\nX be the event of picking exactly two blue balls,\nright because these are the two events\nthat we need to calculate the probability of now\nthere are two probabilities that you need to consider here.\nOne is the event of picking a blue ball from bag a\nand the other is the event of picking exactly two blue balls.\nOkay.\nSo these two are represented by a and X respectively\nand so what we want is the probability of occurrence\nof event a given X,\nwhich means that given\nthat we're picking exactly two blue balls.\nWhat is the probability\nthat we are picking a blue ball from bag?\nSo by the definition of conditional probability,\nthis is exactly what our equation will look like.\nCorrect.\nThis is basically a occurrence of event a given element X\nand this is the probability of a and x\nand this is the probability of X alone, correct.\nWhat we need to do is we need to find these two probabilities\nwhich is probability of a and X occurring together\nand probability of X. Okay.\nThis is the entire solution.\nSo how do you find P probability\nof X this you can do in three ways.\nSo first is white ball from a either white from be\nor read from see now first is to find the probability of x x\nbasically represents the event\nof picking exactly two blue balls.\nRight.\nSo these are the three ways in which it is possible.\nSo you'll pick one blue ball from bowel a and one from bowel\nbe in the second case.\nYou can pick one\nfrom a and another blue ball from see in the third case.\nYou can pick a blue ball from Bagby\nand a blue ball from bagsy.\nRight?\nThese are the three ways in which it is possible.\nSo you need to find the probability of each\nof this step do is\nthat you need to find the probability of a\nand X occurring together.\nThis is the sum of terms one and two.\nOkay, this is\nbecause in both of these events,\nyou're picking a ball from bag, correct?\nSo there is find out this probability and let\nme know your answer in the comment section.\nAll right.\nWe'll see if you get the answer right?\nI gave you the entire solution to this.\nAll you have to do is substitute the value right?\nIf you want a second or two,\nI'm going to pause on the screen so that you can go through this\nin a more clearer way right?\nRemember that you need to calculate two.\nHe's the first probability\nthat you need to calculate is the event of picking a blue ball\nfrom bag a given\nthat you're picking exactly two blue balls.\nOkay, II probability you need to calculate is the event\nof picking exactly to bluebirds.\nAll right.\nThese are the two probabilities.\nYou need to calculate so remember that and this\nis the solution.\nAll right, so guys,\nmake sure you mention your answers\nin the comment section for now.\nLet's move on and Get our next topic,\nwhich is the inferential statistics.\nSo guys, we just completed the probability module right now.\nWe will discuss inferential statistics,\nwhich is the second type of Statistics.\nWe discussed descriptive statistics earlier.\nAll right.\nSo like I mentioned earlier inferential statistics also\nknown as statistical inference is a branch of Statistics\nthat deals with forming inferences and predictions\nabout a population based on a sample of data.\nTaken from the population.\nAll right, and the question you should ask is\nhow does one form inferences or predictions on a sample?\nThe answer is you use Point estimation?\nOkay.\nNow you must be wondering\nwhat is point estimation one estimation is concerned\nwith the use of the sample data to measure a single value\nwhich serves as an approximate value\nor the best estimate of an unknown population parameter.\nThat's a little confusing.\nLet me break it down to you for Camping\nin order to calculate the mean of a huge population.\nWhat we do is we first draw out the sample of the population\nand then we find the sample mean\nright the sample mean is then used to estimate\nthe population mean this is basically Point estimate,\nyou're estimating the value of one of the parameters\nof the population, right?\nBasically the main\nyou're trying to estimate the value of the mean.\nThis is what point estimation is the two main terms\nin point estimation.\nThere's something known as\nas the estimator and the something known\nas the estimate estimator is a function of the sample\nthat is used to find out the estimate.\nAlright in this example.\nIt's basically the sample mean right so a function\nthat calculates the sample mean is known as the estimator\nand the realized value\nof the estimator is the estimate right?\nSo I hope Point estimation is clear.\nNow, how do you find the estimates?\nThere are four common ways in which you can do this.\nThe first one is method of Moment yo,\nwhat you do is you form an equation\nin the sample data set\nand then you analyze the similar equation\nin the population data set\nas well like the population mean population variance and so on.\nSo in simple terms,\nwhat you're doing is you're taking down some known facts\nabout the population\nand you're extending those ideas to the sample.\nAlright, once you do that,\nyou can analyze the sample and estimate more\nessential or more complex values right next.\nWe have maximum likelihood.\nThis method basically uses a model to estimate a value.\nAll right.\nNow a maximum likelihood is majorly based on probability.\nSo there's a lot of probability involved in this method next.\nWe have the base estimator this works by minimizing\nthe errors or the average risk.\nOkay, the base estimator has a lot to do\nwith the Bayes theorem.\nAll right, let's not get into the depth\nof these estimation methods.\nFinally.\nWe have the best unbiased estimators in this method.\nThere are seven unbiased estimators that can be used\nto approximate a parameter.\nOkay.\nSo Guys these were a couple of methods\nthat are used to find the estimate\nbut the most well-known method to find the estimate is known as\nthe interval estimation.\nOkay.\nThis is one\nof the most important estimation methods right?\nThis is where confidence interval also comes\ninto the picture right apart from interval estimation.\nWe also have something known as margin of error.\nSo I'll be discussing all of this.\nIn the upcoming slides.\nSo first let's understand.\nWhat is interval estimate?\nOkay, an interval or range of values,\nwhich are used to estimate a population parameter is known as\nan interval estimation, right?\nThat's very understandable.\nBasically what they're trying to see is you're going to estimate\nthe value of a parameter.\nLet's say you're trying to find the mean of a population.\nWhat you're going to do is you're going to build a range\nand your value will lie in that range or in that interval.\nAlright, so this way your output is going to be more accurate\nbecause you've not predicted a point estimation instead.\nYou have estimated an interval\nwithin which your value might occur, right?\nOkay.\nNow this image clearly shows\nhow Point estimate and interval estimate or different\nso guys interval estimate is obviously more accurate\nbecause you are not just focusing on a particular value\nor a particular point\nin order to predict the probability instead.\nYou're saying that the value might be\nwithin this range between the lower confidence limit\nand the upper confidence limit.\nAll right, this is denotes the range or the interval.\nOkay, if you're still confused about interval estimation,\nlet me give you a small example\nif I stated that I will take 30 minutes to reach the theater.\nThis is known as Point estimation.\nOkay, but if I stated\nthat I will take between 45 minutes\nto an hour to reach the theater.\nThis is an example of into Estimation.\nAll right.\nI hope it's clear.\nNow now interval estimation gives rise to two important\nstatistical terminologies one is known as confidence interval\nand the other is known as margin of error.\nAll right.\nSo there's it's important\nthat you pay attention\nto both of these terminologies confidence interval is one\nof the most significant measures\nthat are used to check\nhow essential machine learning model is.\nAll right.\nSo what is confidence interval confidence interval is\nthe measure of your confidence\nthat the interval estimated contains\nthe population parameter or the population mean\nor any of those parameters right now statisticians\nuse confidence interval to describe the amount\nof uncertainty associated\nwith the sample estimate of a population parameter now guys,\nthis is a lot of definition.\nLet me just make you understand confidence interval\nwith a small example.\nOkay.\nLet's say that you perform\na survey and you survey a group of cat owners.\nThe see how many cans of cat food they purchase\nin one year.\nOkay, you test\nyour statistics at the 99 percent confidence level\nand you get a confidence interval\nof hundred comma 200 this means\nthat you think\nthat the cat owners\nby between hundred to two hundred cans in a year and also\nsince the confidence level is 99% shows\nthat you're very confident that the results are, correct.\nOkay.\nI hope all of you are clear with that.\nAlright, so your confidence interval here will be\na hundred and two hundred\nand your confidence level will be 99% Right?\nThat's the difference between confidence interval\nand confidence level So within your confidence interval\nyour value is going to lie and your confidence level will show\nhow confident you are about your estimation, right?\nI hope that was clear.\nLet's look at margin of error.\nNo margin of error\nfor a given level of confidence is a greatest possible distance\nbetween the Point estimate\nand the value of the parameter\nthat it is estimating you can say\nthat it is a deviation from the actual point estimate right.\nNow.\nThe margin of error can be calculated\nusing this formula now zc her denotes the critical value\nor the confidence interval\nand this is X standard deviation divided by root\nof the sample size.\nAll right, n is basically the sample size now,\nlet's understand how you can estimate\nthe confidence intervals.\nSo guys the level of confidence\nwhich is denoted by C is the probability\nthat the interval estimate contains a population parameter.\nLet's say that you're trying to estimate the mean.\nAll right.\nSo the level of confidence is the probability\nthat the interval estimate contains\nthe population parameter.\nSo this interval between minus Z and z\nor the area beneath this curve is nothing but the probability\nthat the interval estimate contains a population parameter.\nYou don't all right.\nIt should basically contain the value\nthat you are predicting right.\nNow.\nThese are known as critical values.\nThis is basically your lower limit\nand your higher limit confidence level.\nAlso, there's something known as the Z score now.\nThis court can be calculated by using the standard normal table.\nAll right, if you look it up anywhere on Google\nyou'll find the z-score table\nor the standard normal table to understand\nhow this is done.\nLet's look at a small example.\nOkay, let's say that the level of confidence.\nVince is 90% This means that you are 90% confident\nthat the interval contains the population mean.\nOkay, so the remaining 10% which is out of hundred percent.\nThe remaining 10% is equally distributed\non these tail regions.\nOkay, so you have 0.05 here and 0.05 over here, right?\nSo on either side\nof see you will distribute the other leftover percentage\nnow these Z scores are calculated from the table\nas I mentioned before.\nAll right one.\nI'm 6 4 5 is get collated from the standard normal table.\nOkay, so guys how you estimate the level of confidence?\nSo to sum it up.\nLet me tell you the steps that are involved in constructing\na confidence interval first.\nYou would start by identifying a sample statistic.\nOkay.\nThis is the statistic\nthat you will use to estimate a population parameter.\nThis can be anything like the mean\nof the sample next you will select a confidence level\nnow the confidence level describes the uncertainty\nof a Sampling method right\nafter that you'll find something known as the margin\nof error right?\nWe discussed margin of error earlier.\nSo you find this based on the equation\nthat I explained in the previous slide,\nthen you'll finally specify the confidence interval.\nAll right.\nNow, let's look at a problem statement\nto better understand this concept a random sample\nof 32 textbook prices is taken from a local College Bookstore.\nThe mean of the sample is so so\nand so and the sample standard deviation is\nThis use a 95% confident level\nand find the margin of error for the mean price\nof all text books in the bookstore.\nOkay.\nNow, this is a very straightforward question.\nIf you want you can read the question again.\nAll you have to do is you have to just substitute the values\ninto the equation.\nAll right, so guys,\nwe know the formula for margin of error you take the Z score\nfrom the table.\nAfter that we have deviation Madrid's 23.4 for right\nand that's standard deviation and n stands for the number\nof samples here.\nThe number of samples is 32 basically 32 textbooks.\nSo approximately your margin of error is going to be\naround 8.1 to this is a pretty simple question.\nAll right.\nI hope all of you understood this now\nthat you know,\nthe idea behind confidence interval.\nLet's move ahead to one\nof the most important topics in statistical inference,\nwhich is hypothesis testing, right?\nSo Ugly statisticians use hypothesis testing\nto formally check\nwhether the hypothesis is accepted or rejected.\nOkay, hypothesis.\nTesting is an inferential statistical technique\nused to determine\nwhether there is enough evidence in a data sample to infer\nthat a certain condition holds true for an entire population.\nSo to understand\nthe characteristics of a general population,\nwe take a random sample,\nand we analyze the properties of the sample right we test.\nWhether or not the identified conclusion represents\nthe population accurately\nand finally we interpret the results now\nwhether or not to accept the hypothesis depends\nupon the percentage value that we get from the hypothesis.\nOkay, so to better understand this,\nlet's look at a small example before that.\nThere are a few steps that are followed\nin hypothesis testing you begin by stating the null\nand the alternative hypothesis.\nAll right.\nI'll tell you what exactly these terms are\nand then you formulate.\nAnalysis plan right after that you analyze the sample data\nand finally you can interpret the results\nright now to understand the entire hypothesis testing.\nWe look at a good example.\nOkay now consider for boys Nick jean-bob\nand Harry these boys were caught bunking a class\nand they were asked to stay back at school\nand clean the classroom as a punishment, right?\nSo what John did is he decided\nthat four of them would take turns to clean their classrooms.\nHe came up with a plan of writing each\nof their names on chits\nand putting them\nin a bowl now every day they had to pick up a name from the bowel\nand that person had to play in the clock, right?\nThat sounds pretty fair enough now it is been three days\nand everybody's name has come up except John's assuming\nthat this event is completely random\nand free of bias.\nWhat is a probability\nof John not cheating right or is the probability\nthat he's not actually cheating this can Solved\nby using hypothesis testing.\nOkay.\nSo we'll Begin by calculating the probability of John\nnot being picked for a day.\nAlright, so we're going to assume\nthat the event is free of bias.\nSo we need to find out the probability\nof John not cheating right first we will find the probability\nthat John is not picked for a day, right?\nWe get 3 out of 4,\nwhich is basically 75% 75% is fairly high.\nSo if John is not picked for three days in a row\nthe Probability will drop down to approximately 42% Okay.\nSo three days in a row meaning\nthat is the probability drops down to 42 percent.\nNow, let's consider a situation\nwhere John is not picked for 12 days in a row\nthe probability drops down to three point two percent.\nOkay.\nThat's the probability of John cheating becomes\nfairly high, right?\nSo in order\nfor statisticians to come to a conclusion,\nthey Define what is known as a threshold value.\nRight considering the above situation\nif the threshold value is set to 5 percent.\nIt would indicate\nthat if the probability lies below 5% then John is cheating\nhis way out of detention.\nBut if the probability is about threshold value then John\nit just lucky and his name isn't getting picked.\nSo the probability\nand hypothesis testing give rise to two important components\nof hypothesis testing,\nwhich is null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.\nNull.\nHypothesis is based.\nBasically approving\nthe Assumption alternate hypothesis is\nwhen your result disapproves the Assumption right therefore\nin our example,\nif the probability of an event occurring\nis less than 5% which it is then the event is biased hence.\nIt proves the alternate hypothesis.\nSo guys with this we come to the end of this session.\nLet's go ahead and understand what exactly is.\nWas learning so supervised learning is\nwhere you have the input variable X\nand the output variable Y and use an algorithm\nto learn the map Egg function from the input to the output\nas I mentioned earlier\nwith the example of face detection.\nSo it is called supervised learning\nbecause the process of an algorithm learning\nfrom the training data set can be thought\nof as a teacher supervising the learning process.\nSo if we have a look at the supervised learning steps\nor What would rather say the workflow?\nSo the model is used as you can see here.\nWe have the historic data.\nThen we again we have the random sampling.\nWe split the data into train your asset\nand the testing data set using the training data set.\nWe with the help of machine learning\nwhich is supervised machine learning.\nWe create statistical model then\nafter we have a mod which is being generated\nwith the help of the training data set.\nWhat we do is use the testing data set\nfor production and testing.\nWhat we do is get the output\nand finally we have the model validation outcome.\nThat was the training and testing.\nSo if we have a look at the prediction part\nof any particular supervised learning algorithm,\nso the model is used for operating outcome\nof a new data set.\nSo whenever performance\nof the model degraded the model is retrained\nor if there are any performance issues,\nthe model is retained with the help of the new data now\nwhen we talk about supervisor\nin there not just one but quite a few algorithms here.\nSo we have linear regression logistic regression.\nThis is entry.\nWe have random Forest.\nWe have made by classifiers.\nSo linear regression is used to estimate real values.\nFor example, the cost of houses.\nThe number of calls the total sales based\non the continuous variables.\nSo that is what reading regression is.\nNow when we talk about logistic regression,\nwhich is used to estimate discrete values, for example,\nwhich are binary values like 0 and 1 yes,\nor no true.\nFalse based on the given set of independent variables.\nSo for example,\nwhen you are talking about something like the chances\nof winning or if you talk\nabout winning which can be either true or false\nif will it rain today with it can be the yes or no,\nso it cannot be\nlike when the output of a particular algorithm\nor the particular question is either.\nYes.\nNo or Banner e then\nonly we use a large stick regression the next\nwe have decision trees.\nSo now these are used for classification problems it work.\nX for both categorical and continuous\ndependent variables and\nif we talk about random Forest So Random Forest is an M symbol\nof a decision tree,\nit gives better prediction accuracy than decision tree.\nSo that is another type of supervised learning algorithm.\nAnd finally we have the need based classifier.\nSo it was\na classification technique based on the Bayes theorem\nwith an assumption of Independence between predictors.\nA linear regression is one of the easiest algorithm\nin machine learning.\nIt is a statistical model\nthat attempts to show the relationship\nbetween two variables with a linear equation.\nBut before we drill down\nto linear regression algorithm in depth,\nI'll give you a quick overview of today's agenda.\nSo we'll start a session\nwith a quick overview of what is regression\nas linear regression is one of a type\nof regression algorithm.\nOnce we learn about regression,\nits use case the various types of it next.\nWe'll learn about the algorithm from scratch.\nEach where I'll teach\nyou it's mathematical implementation first,\nthen we'll drill down to the coding part\nand Implement linear regression using python\nin today's session will deal\nwith linear regression algorithm using least Square method check\nits goodness of fit\nor how close the data is\nto the fitted regression line using the R square method.\nAnd then finally\nwhat will do will optimize it using the gradient decent method\nin the last part on the coding session.\nI'll teach you to implement linear regression using Python\nand Coding session\nwould be divided into two parts the first part would consist\nof linear regression using python from scratch\nwhere you will use the mathematical algorithm\nthat you have learned in this session.\nAnd in the next part of the coding session\nwill be using scikit-learn for direct implementation\nof linear regression.\nSo let's begin our session with what is regression.\nWell regression analysis is\na form of predictive modeling technique\nwhich investigates the relationship between a dependent\nand independent variable a regression analysis.\nVols graphing a line over a set of data points\nthat most closely fits the overall shape of the data\nor regression shows the changes in a dependent variable\non the y-axis\nto the changes\nin the explanation variable on the x-axis fine.\nNow you would ask what are the uses of regression?\nWell, there are major three uses of regression analysis the first\nbeing determining the strength of predicates errs,\nthe regression might be used to identify the strength\nof the effect\nthat the independent variables have on the dependent variable\nor But you can ask question.\nLike what is the strength of relationship between sales\nand marketing spending or what is the relationship between age\nand income second is forecasting\nan effect in this the regression can be used to forecast effects\nor impact of changes.\nThat is the regression analysis help us to understand\nhow much the dependent variable changes with the change\nand one or more independent variable fine.\nFor example, you can ask question like how much\nadditional say Lancome will I get for each?\nThousand dollars spent on marketing.\nSo it is Trend forecasting\nin this the regression analysis predict Trends\nand future values.\nThe regression analysis can be used to get Point estimates\nin this you can ask questions.\nLike what will be the price of Bitcoin\nand next six months, right?\nSo next topic is linear versus logistic regression by now.\nI hope that you know, what a regression is.\nSo let's move on and understand its type.\nSo there are various kinds of regression like linear\nregression logistic regression polynomial regression.\nOthers only but for this session\nwill be focusing on linear and logistic regression.\nSo let's move on and let me tell you what is linear regression.\nAnd what is logistic regression\nthen what we'll do we'll compare both of them.\nAll right.\nSo starting with linear regression\nin simple linear regression,\nwe are interested in things like y equal MX plus C.\nSo what we are trying to find is the correlation between X\nand Y variable this means\nthat every value of x\nhas a corresponding value of y and it\nif it is continuous.\nAll right, however in logistic regression,\nwe are not fitting our data to a straight line\nlike linear regression instead what we are doing.\nWe are mapping Y versus X\nto a sigmoid function in logistic regression.\nWhat we find out is is y 1 or 0 for this particular value of x\nso thus we are essentially deciding true or false value\nfor a given value of x fine.\nSo as a core concept of linear regression,\nyou can say that the data is modeled using a straight.\nBut in the case of logistic regression\nthe data is module using a sigmoid function.\nThe linear regression is used with continuous variables\non the other hand the logistic regression.\nIt is used with categorical variable the output\nor the prediction of a linear regression\nis a value of the variable\non the other hand the output of production\nof a logistic regression is the probability\nof occurrence of the event.\nNow, how will you check the accuracy\nand goodness of fit in case of linear regression?\nWe are various methods like measured by loss R square.\nAre adjusted r squared Etc\nwhile in the case of logistic regression you\nhave accuracy precision recall F1 score,\nwhich is nothing but the harmonic mean of precision\nand recall next is Roc curve\nfor determining the probability threshold for classification\nor the confusion Matrix Etc.\nThere are many all right.\nSo summarizing the difference\nbetween linear and logistic regression.\nYou can say\nthat the type of function you are mapping to is the main point\nof difference between linear and logistic regression\na linear regression model.\nThe Continuous X2 a continuous file on the other hand\na logistic regression Maps a continuous x\nto the bindery why\nso we can use logistic regression to make category\nor true false decisions from the data find\nso let's move on ahead next is linear\nregression selection criteria,\nor you can say when will you use linear regression?\nSo the first is classification\nand regression capabilities regression models predict\na continuous variable such as the sales made on a day\nor predict the temperature\nof a city T their Reliance on a polynomial\nlike a straight line to fit a data set\nposes a real challenge\nwhen it comes towards building a classification capability.\nLet's imagine that you fit a line with a train points\nthat you have now imagine you add some more data points to it.\nBut in order to fit it, what do you have to do?\nYou have to change your existing model\nthat is maybe you have to change the threshold itself.\nSo this will happen with each new data point you are\nto the model hence.\nThe linear regression is not good for classification models.\nFine.\nNext is data quality.\nEach missing value removes one data point\nthat could optimize\nthe regression and simple linear regression.\nThe outliers can significantly\ndisrupt the outcome just for now.\nYou can know that if you remove the outliers your model\nwill become very good.\nAll right.\nSo this is about data quality.\nNext is computational complexity a linear regression is often\nnot computationally expensive as compared to the decision tree\nor the clustering algorithm the order of complexity\nfor n training example and X features usually Falls\nin either Big O of x\nOr bigger of xn next is comprehensible\nand transparent the linear regression are\neasily comprehensible and transparent in nature.\nThey can be represented by a simple mathematical notation\nto anyone and can be understood very easily.\nSo these are some of the criteria based\non which you will select the linear regression algorithm.\nAll right.\nNext is where is linear regression used first\nis evaluating trans and sales estimate.\nWell linear regression can be used in business\nto evaluate Trends and make estimates.\nForecast for example,\nif a company sales have increased steadily every month\nfor past few years then conducting a linear analysis\non the sales data with monthly sales on the y axis\nand time on the x axis.\nThis will give you a line\nthat predicts the upward Trends in the sale after creating\nthe trendline the company could use the slope\nof the lines to focused sale in future months.\nNext is analyzing.\nThe impact of price changes will linear regression\ncan be used to analyze the effect of pricing\non Omer behavior for instance,\nif a company changes\nthe price on a certain product several times,\nthen it can record the quantity itself for each price level\nand then perform a linear regression\nwith sold quantity as\na dependent variable and price as the independent variable.\nThis would result in a line that depicts the extent\nto which the customer reduce their consumption of the product\nas the prices increasing.\nSo this result would help us in future pricing decisions.\nNext is assessment of risk in financial services\nand insurance domain.\nLinear regression can be used to analyze the risk,\nfor example health insurance company might conduct\na linear regression algorithm\nhow it can do it can do it by plotting the number of claims\nper customer against its age and they might discover\nthat the old customers\ntend to make more health insurance claim.\nWell the result of such analysis might guide\nimportant business decisions.\nAll right, so by now you have just a rough idea of\nwhat linear regression algorithm as like\nwhat it does where it is used when You should use it early.\nNow.\nLet's move on and understand the algorithm\nand depth so suppose you have independent variable\non the x-axis and dependent variable on the y-axis.\nAll right suppose.\nThis is the data point on the x axis.\nThe independent variable is increasing on the x-axis.\nAnd so does the dependent variable on the y-axis?\nSo what kind of linear regression line you would get\nyou would get a positive linear regression line.\nAll right as the slope would be positive next is suppose.\nYou have an independent variable on the X axis\nwhich is increasing\nand on the other hand the dependent variable on the y-axis\nthat is decreasing.\nSo what kind of line will you get in that case?\nYou will get a negative regression line.\nIn this case as the slope of the line is negative\nand this particular line\nthat is line of y equal MX\nplus C is a line of linear regression\nwhich shows the relationship between independent variable\nand dependent variable\nand this line is only known as line of linear regression.\nOkay.\nSo let's add some data points, too.\nOur graph so these are some observation\nor data points on our graph.\nSo let's plot some more.\nOkay.\nNow all our data points are plotted now our task is\nto create a regression line or the best fit line.\nAll right now\nonce our regression line is drawn now,\nit's the task of production now suppose.\nThis is our estimated value or the predicted value\nand this is our actual value.\nOkay.\nSo what we have to do our main goal is to reduce this error\nthat is to reduce the distance\nbetween the Estimated or the predicted value\nand the actual value the best fit line would be the one\nwhich had the least error\nor the least difference in estimated value\nand the actual value.\nAll right, and other words we have to minimize the error.\nThis was a brief understanding\nof linear regression algorithm soon.\nWe'll jump towards mathematical implementation.\nBut for then let me tell you this suppose you draw a graph\nwith speed on the x-axis\nand distance covered\non the y axis with the time domain in constant.\nIf you plot a graph between the speed travel\nby the vehicle\nand the distance traveled in a fixed unit of time,\nthen you will get a positive relationship.\nAll right.\nSo suppose the equation of a line is y equal MX plus C.\nThen in this case Y is the distance traveled\nin a fixed duration of time x\nis the speed of vehicle m is the positive slope\nof the line and see is the y-intercept of the line.\nAll right suppose the distance remaining constant.\nYou have to plot a graph between the speed of the vehicle\nand the time taken to travel a fixed distance.\nThen in that case you will get a line\nwith a negative relationship.\nAll right, the slope of the line is negative here the equation\nof line changes to y equal minus of MX plus C\nwhere Y is the time taken to travel\na fixed distance X is the speed\nof vehicle m is the negative slope\nof the line and see is the y-intercept of the line.\nAll right.\nNow, let's get back\nto our independent and dependent variable.\nSo in that term, why is our dependent variable\nand X that is our independent variable now,\nlet's move on.\nAnd see them at the magical implementation of the things.\nAlright, so we have x\nequal 1 2 3 4 5 let's plot them on the x-axis.\nSo 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 align and we have y as 3 4 2 4 5.\nAll right.\nSo let's plot 1\n2 3 4 5 on the y-axis now,\nlet's plot our coordinates 1 by 1 so x equal 1 and y equal 3,\nso we have here x\nequal 1 and y equal\n3 So this is the point 1 comma 3 so similarly\nwe have 1 3 2 4 3 2 4 4 &amp; 5 5.\nAlright, so moving on ahead.\nLet's calculate the mean of X and Y and plot it on the graph.\nAll right, so mean of X is 1\nplus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 divided by 5.\nThat is 3.\nAll right, similarly mean of Y is 3 plus 4 plus 2\nplus 4 plus 5 that is 18.\nSo we 10 divided by 5.\nThat is nothing but 3.6.\nAlright, so next what we'll do we'll plot.\nI mean that is 3 comma 3 .6 on the graph.\nOkay.\nSo there's a point 3 comma 3 .6\nsee our goal is to find or predict the best fit line\nusing the least Square Method All right.\nSo in order to find\nthat we first need to find the equation of line,\nso let's find the equation of our regression line.\nAlright, so let's suppose this is our regression line\ny equal MX plus C.\nNow.\nWe have an equation of line.\nSo all we need to do is find the value of M\nand C. I wear m equals summation of x\nminus X bar X Y minus y bar upon the summation of x\nminus X bar whole Square don't get confused.\nLet me resolve it for you.\nAll right.\nSo moving on ahead as a part of formula.\nWhat we are going to do will calculate x minus X bar.\nSo we have X as 1 minus X bar as 3 so 1 minus 3\nthat is minus 2 next.\nWe have x equal to minus its mean 3\nthat is minus 1 similarly we 3 -\n3 0 4 minus 3 1 5 - 3 2.\nAll right, so x minus X bar.\nIt's nothing but the distance of all the point\nthrough the line y equal 3\nand what does this y\nminus y bar implies it implies the distance\nof all the point from the line\nx equal 3 .6 fine.\nSo let's calculate the value of y minus y bar.\nSo starting with y equal 3 -\nvalue of y bar that is 3.6.\nSo it is three minus three. .6.\nHow much -\nof 0.6 next is 4 minus 3.6 that is 0.4 next to minus 3.6\nthat is - of 1.6.\nNext is 4 minus 3.6 that is 0.4 again,\n5 minus 3.6 that is 1.4.\nAlright, so now we are done with Y minus y bar fine now next\nwe will calculate x minus X bar whole Square.\nSo let's calculate x minus X bar whole Square\nso it is -\n2 whole square that is 4 minus 1 whole square.\nThat is 1 0 squared is 0 1 Square 1 2 square for fine.\nSo now in our table we have x minus X bar y minus y bar\nand x minus X bar whole Square.\nNow what we need.\nWe need the product of x minus X bar X Y minus y bar.\nAlright, so let's see the product of x\nminus X bar X Y minus\ny bar that is minus of 2 x minus of 0.6.\nThat is 1.2 minus of 1 x 0 point 4.\nThat is minus.\n- of zero point 4 0 x minus of 1.6.\nThat is 0 1 multiplied by zero point four\nthat is 0.4.\nAnd next 2 multiplied by 1 point for that is 2.8.\nAll right.\nNow almost all the parts of our formula is done.\nSo now what we need to do is get the summation\nof last two columns.\nAll right, so the summation of x minus X bar whole square is 10\nand the summation of x\nminus X bar X Y minus y bar is\nfor So the value of M will be equal to 4 by 10 fine.\nSo let's put this value\nof m equals zero point 4 and our line y equal MX plus C.\nSo let's file all the points into the equation\nand find the value of C.\nSo we have y as 3.6 remember the mean by m as 0.4\nwhich we calculated just now X as the mean value of x\nthat is 3 and we\nhave the equation as 3 point 6 equals 0 .4\nApplied by 3 plus C. Alright\nthat is 3.6 equal 1 Point 2 plus C.\nSo what is the value of C that is 3.6 minus 1.2.\nThat is 2.4.\nAll right.\nSo what we had we had m equals zero point four C as 2.4.\nAnd then finally\nwhen we calculate the equation of the regression line,\nwhat we get is y equal zero point four times of X\nplus two point four.\nSo this is the regression line.\nAll right, so there is\nhow you are plotting your points this Actual point.\nAll right now for given m equals zero point four and SQL 2.4.\nLet's predict the value of y for x equal 1 2 3 4 &amp; 5.\nSo when x equal 1 the predicted value\nof y will be zero point four x\none plus two point four that is 2.8.\nSimilarly when x equal to predicted value\nof y will be zero point 4 x\n2 + 2 point 4 that equals to 3 point 2 similarly x\nequal 3 y will be 3. .6.\nX equals 4 y will be 4 point 0 x\nequal 5 y will be four point four.\nSo let's plot them on the graph\nand the line passing through all these predicting point\nand cutting y-axis at 2.4 as the line of regression.\nNow your task is to calculate the distance between the actual\nand the predicted value\nand your job is to reduce the distance.\nAll right, or in other words,\nyou have to reduce the error between the actual\nand the predicted value the line\nwith the least error will be the line of linear regression.\nChicken or regression line\nand it will also be the best fit line.\nAll right.\nSo this is how things work in computer.\nSo what it do it performs n number of iteration\nfor different values of M for different values of M.\nIt will calculate the equation of line\nwhere y equals MX plus C.\nRight?\nSo as the value of M changes the line\nis changing so iteration will start from one.\nAll right, and it will perform a number of iteration.\nSo after every iteration\nwhat it will do it will calculate the predicted.\nValue according to the line and compare the distance\nof actual value to the predicted value\nand the value of M\nfor which the distance between the actual\nand the predicted value is minimum will be selected\nas the best fit line.\nAll right.\nNow that we have calculated the best fit line now,\nit's time to check the goodness of fit or to check\nhow good a model is performing.\nSo in order to do that,\nwe have a method called R square method.\nSo what is this R square?\nWell r-squared value is a statistical measure\nof how close the data are\nto the fitted regression line in general.\nIt is considered\nthat a high r-squared value model is a good model,\nbut you can also have a lower squared value\nfor a good model as well\nor a higher squared value for a model\nthat does not fit at all.\nI like it is also known as coefficient of determination\nor the coefficient of multiple determination.\nLet's move on and see how a square is calculated.\nSo these are our actual values plotted on the graph.\nWe had calculated the predicted values\nof Y as 2.8 3.2 3.6 4.0 4.4.\nRemember when we calculated the predicted values\nof Y for the equation Y predicted equals 0 1 4 x\nof X plus two point four for every x\nequal 1 2 3 4 &amp; 5 from there.\nWe got the Ed values of Phi all right.\nSo let's plot it on the graph.\nSo these are point and the line passing\nthrough these points are nothing but the regression line.\nAll right.\nNow what you need to do is\nyou have to check and compare the distance of actual -\nmean versus the distance of predicted - mean alike.\nSo basically what you are doing you are calculating the distance\nof actual value to the mean to distance of predicted value\nto the mean I like\nso there is nothing\nbut a square in mathematically you can represent our school.\nWhereas summation of Y predicted values minus y\nbar whole Square divided by summation of Y minus\ny bar whole Square\nwhere Y is the actual value y p is the predicted value\nand Y Bar is the mean value of y that is nothing but 3.6.\nRemember, this is our formula.\nSo next what we'll do we'll calculate y minus.\nY1.\nSo we have y is 3y bar as 3 point 6,\nso we'll calculate it as 3 minus 3.6\nthat is nothing but minus of 0.6 similarly for y equal 4\nand Y Bar equal 3.6.\nWe have y minus y bar as zero point 4 then 2 minus 3.6.\nIt is 1 point 6 4 minus 3.6 again zero point four\nand five minus 3.6\nit is 1.4.\nSo we got the value of y minus y bar.\nNow what we have to do we have to take it Square.\nSo we have minus 0.6 Square as 0.36 0.4 Square as 0.16 -\nof 1.6 Square as 2.56 0.4 Square as 0.16 and 1.4 squared\nis 1.96 now is a part of formula what we need.\nWe need our YP minus y BAR value.\nSo these are VIP values and we have to subtract it from the No,\nwhy so 2 .8 minus 3.6 that is minus 0.8.\nSimilarly.\nWe will get 3.2 minus 3.6 that is 0.4 and 3.6 minus 3.6.\nThat is 0 for 1 0 minus 3.6 that is 0.4.\nThen 4 .4 minus 3.6 that is 0.8.\nSo we calculated the value of YP minus y bar now,\nit's our turn to calculate the value of y b minus\ny bar whole Square next.\nWe have -\nof 0.8 Square as 0.64 - of Point four square as 0.160 Square\n0 0 point 4 Square as again 0.16 and 0.8 Square as 0.64.\nAll right.\nNow as a part of formula\nwhat it suggests it suggests me to take the summation of Y P\nminus y bar whole square\nand summation of Y minus y bar whole Square.\nAll right.\nLet's see.\nSo in submitting y minus y bar whole Square\nwhat you get is five point two and summation of Y P minus\ny bar whole Square you get one point six.\nSo the value of R square can be calculated as\n1 point 6 upon 5.2 fine.\nSo the result which will get is approximately equal to 0.3.\nWell, this is not a good fit.\nAll right, so it suggests\nthat the data points are far away from the regression line.\nAlright, so this is\nhow your graph will look like when R square is 0.3\nwhen you increase the value of R square to 0.7.\nSo you'll see\nthat the actual value would like closer to the regression line\nwhen it reaches to 0.9 it comes.\nMore clothes and when the value of approximately equals\nto 1 then the actual values lies on the regression line itself,\nfor example, in this case.\nIf you get a very low value of R square suppose 0.02.\nSo in that case what will see\nthat the actual values are very far away\nfrom the regression line or you can say\nthat there are too many outliers in your data.\nYou cannot focus and thing from the data.\nAll right.\nSo this was all about the calculation of our Square now,\nyou might get a question like are low values\nof Square always bad.\nWell in some field it is entirely expected that I ask\nwhere value will be low.\nFor example any field\nthat attempts to predict human behavior such as psychology\ntypically has r-squared values lower than around 50%\nthrough which you can conclude\nthat humans are simply harder\nto predict the under physical process furthermore.\nIf you ask what value is low,\nbut you have statistically significant predictors,\nthen you can still draw important conclusion\nabout how changes in the predicator values associated.\nCreated with the changes in the response value regardless\nof the r-squared\nthe significant coefficient still represent the mean change\nin the response for one unit of change in the predicator\nwhile holding other predicated in the model constant.\nObviously this type\nof information can be extremely valuable.\nAll right.\nAll right.\nSo this was all about the theoretical concept now,\nlet's move on to the coding part\nand understand the code in depth.\nSo for implementing linear regression using python,\nI will be using Anaconda\nwith jupyter notebook installed on it.\nSo I like there's a jupyter notebook\nand we are using python 3.0 on it.\nAlright, so we are going to use a data set consisting\nof head size and human brain of different people.\nAll right.\nSo let's import our data set percent matplotlib and line.\nWe are importing numpy\nas NP pandas as speedy and matplotlib and from matplotlib.\nWe are importing pipe lot of that as PLT.\nAlright next we will import our data had brain dot CSV\nand store it in the database table.\nLet's execute the Run button and see the armor.\nBut so this task symbol it symbolizes\nthat it still executing.\nSo there's a output our data set consists\nof two thirty seven rows and 4 columns.\nWe have columns as gender age range head size\nin centimeter Cube\nand brain weights and Graham fine.\nSo there's our sample data set.\nThis is how it looks it consists of all these data set.\nSo now that we have imported our data,\nso as you can see they are 237 values in the training set\nso we can find a linear.\nRelationship between the head size and the Brain weights.\nSo now what we'll do we'll collect X &amp; Y\nthe X would consist of the head size values\nand the Y would consist of brain with values.\nSo collecting X and Y. Let's execute the Run.\nDone next what we'll do we need to find the values of b 1\nor B not or you can say m and C.\nSo we'll need the mean of X and Y values first of all\nwhat we'll do we'll calculate the mean of X and Y so mean x\nequal NP dot Min X.\nSo mean is a predefined function of Numb by similarly mean\nunderscore y equal NP dot mean of Y,\nso what it will return\nif you'll return the mean values of Y\nnext we'll check the total number of values.\nSo m equals.\nWell length of X. Alright,\nthen we'll use the formula to calculate the values\nof b 1 and B naught or MNC.\nAll right, let's execute the Run button and see\nwhat is the result.\nSo as you can see here on the screen,\nwe have got d 1 as 0 point 2 6 3\nand be not as three twenty five point five seven.\nAlright, so now that we have a coefficient.\nSo comparing it with the equation y equal MX plus C.\nYou can say that brain weight equals\nzero point 2 6 3 X Head size plus three twenty five point\nfive seven so you can say\nthat the value of M here is zero point\n2 6 3 and the value of C.\nHere is three twenty five point five seven.\nAll right, so there's our linear model now,\nlet's plot it and see graphically.\nLet's execute it.\nSo this is how our plot looks like this model is not so bad.\nBut we need to find out how good our model has.\nSo in order to find it the many methods\nlike root mean Square method the coefficient of determination\nor the a square method.\nSo in this tutorial,\nI have told you about our score method.\nSo let's focus on that and see how good our model is.\nSo let's calculate the R square value.\nAll right here SS underscore T is the total sum of square SS.\nI is the total sum of square of residuals and R square\nas the formula is 1 minus total sum\nof squares upon total sum of square of the residuals.\nAll right next when you execute it,\nyou will get the value of R square as 0.63\nwhich is pretty very good.\nNow that you have implemented simple linear regression model\nusing least Square method,\nlet's move on and see\nhow will you implement the model using machine learning library\ncalled scikit-learn.\nAll right.\nSo this scikit-learn is a simple machine.\nOwning library in Python welding machine learning model are\nvery easy using scikit-learn.\nSo suppose there's a python code.\nSo using the scikit-learn libraries your code shortens\nto this length\nlike so let's execute\nthe Run button and see you will get the same our to score.\nSo today we'll be discussing logistic regression.\nSo let's move forward\nand understand the what and by of logistic regression.\nNow this algorithm is most widely used\nwhen the dependent variable\nor you can see the output is in the binary format.\nAnd so here you need to predict the outcome\nof a categorical dependent variable.\nSo the outcome should be always discreet or categorical\nin nature Now by discrete.\nI mean the value should be binary\nor you can say you just have two values it can either be 0\nor 1 you can either be yes\nor a no either be true or false or high or low.\nSo only these can be the outcomes so the value\nwhich you need to protect should be discrete\nor you can say categorical in nature.\nWhereas in linear regression.\nWe have the value of by or you can say the value.\nTwo predictors in a Range\nthat is how there's a difference between linear regression\nand logistic regression.\nWe must be having question.\nWhy not linear regression now guys in linear regression\nthe value of buyer\nor the value which you need to predict is in a range,\nbut in our case as in the logistic regression,\nwe just have two values it can be either 0\nor it can be one.\nIt should not entertain the values which is\nbelow zero or above one.\nBut in linear regression,\nwe have the value of y in the range so here in order\nto implement logic regression.\nWe need to clip this This part so we don't need the value\nthat is below zero or we don't need the value\nwhich is above 1\nso since the value of y will be between only 0 and 1\nthat is the main rule of logistic regression.\nThe linear line has to be clipped at zero and one now.\nOnce we clip this graph it would look somewhat like this.\nSo here you are getting the curve\nwhich is nothing but three different straight lines.\nSo here we need to make a new way to solve this problem.\nSo this has to be formulated into equation\nand hence we come up with logistic regression.\nSo here the outcome is either 0 or 1.\nWhich is the main rule of logistic regression.\nSo with this our resulting curve cannot be formulated.\nSo hence our main aim to bring the values to 0\nand 1 is fulfilled.\nSo that is how we came up with large stick regression now here\nonce it gets formulated into an equation.\nIt looks somewhat like this.\nSo guys, this is nothing but an S curve\nor you can say the sigmoid curve a sigmoid function curve.\nSo this sigmoid function basically converts any value\nfrom minus infinity to Infinity pure discrete values,\nwhich a Logitech regression wants or you can say the Values\nwhich are in binary format either 0 or 1.\nSo if you see here the values and either 0\nor 1 and this is nothing but just a transition of it,\nbut guys there's a catch over here.\nSo let's say I have a data point that is 0.8.\nNow, how can you decide\nwhether your value is 0\nor 1 now here you have the concept\nof threshold which basically divides your line.\nSo here threshold value\nbasically indicates the probability of either winning\nor losing so here by winning.\nI mean the value is equals to 1.\nAm I losing I mean the values equal to 0\nbut how does it do that?\nLet's have a data point which is over here.\nLet's say my cursor is at 0.8.\nSo here I check\nwhether this value is less than the threshold value or not.\nLet's say if it is more than the threshold value.\nIt should give me the result as 1 if it is less than that,\nthen should give me the result is zero.\nSo here my threshold value is 0.5.\nI need to Define that if my value let's is 0.8.\nIt is a more than 0.5.\nThen the value should be rounded of to 1.\nLet's see if it is less than 0.5.\nLet's I have a value 0.2 then should reduce it to zero.\nSo here you can use the concept\nof threshold value to find output.\nSo here it should be discreet.\nIt should be either 0 or it should be one.\nSo I hope you caught this curve of logistic regression.\nSo guys, this is the sigmoid S curve.\nSo to make this curve we need to make an equation.\nSo let me address that part as well.\nSo let's see how an equation is formed to imitate\nthis functionality so over here,\nwe have an equation of a straight line.\nIt is y is equal to MX plus C.\nSo in this case,\nI just have only one independent variable but let's say\nif we have many independent variable then\nthe equation becomes m 1 x 1 plus m 2 x 2 plus m 3 x\n3 and so on till M NX n now,\nlet us put in B and X.\nSo here the equation becomes Y is equal to b 1 x\n1 plus beta 2 x\n2 plus b 3 x 3 and so on till be nxn plus C.\nSo guys the equation\nof the straight line has a range from minus infinity to Infinity.\nBut in our case or you can say largest equation the value\nwhich we need to predict or you can say the Y value\nit can have the range only from 0 to 1.\nSo in that case we need to transform this equation.\nSo to do that what we\nhad done we have just divide the equation by 1 minus y\nso now Y is equal to 0 so 0\nover 1 minus 0 which is equal to 1\nso 0 over 1 is again 0\nand if you take Y is equals to 1 then 1 over 1 minus 1\nwhich is 0\nso 1 over 0 is infinity.\nSo here my range is now between You know to Infinity,\nbut again, we want the range from minus infinity to Infinity.\nSo for that\nwhat we'll do we'll have the log of this equation.\nSo let's go ahead and have the logarithmic\nof this equation.\nSo here we have this transform it further to get the range\nbetween minus infinity to Infinity so over\nhere we have log of Y\nover 1 minus 1\nand this is your final logistic regression equation.\nSo guys, don't worry.\nYou don't have to write this formula or memorize\nthis formula in Python.\nYou just need to call this function\nwhich is logistic regression\nand everything will be be automatically for you.\nSo I don't want to scare you with the maths\nin the formulas behind it,\nwhich is always good to know how this formula was generated.\nSo I hope you guys are clear\nwith how logistic regression comes into the picture next.\nLet us see what are the major differences\nbetween linear regression was a logistic regression the first\nof all in linear regression,\nwe have the value\nof y as a continuous variable or the variable\nbetween need to predict are continuous in nature.\nWhereas in logistic regression.\nWe have the categorical variable so here the value\nwhich you need to predict should be Creating nature.\nIt should be either 0\nor 1 or should have just two values to it.\nFor example,\nwhether it is raining or it is not raining\nis it humid outside or it is not humid outside.\nNow, does it going to snow and it's not going to snow?\nSo these are the few example,\nwe need to predict\nwhere the values are discrete or you can just predict\nwhether this is happening or not.\nNext linear equation solves your regression problems.\nSo here you have a concept of independent variable\nand the dependent variable.\nSo here you can calculate the value of y\nwhich you need to predict using the A of X so\nhere your y variable or you can see the value\nthat you need to predict are in a range.\nBut whereas in logistic regression you\nhave discrete values.\nSo logistic regression basically solves a classification problem\nso it can basically classify it and it can just give you result\nwhether this event is happening or not.\nSo I hope it is\npretty much Clear till now next in linear equation.\nThe graph that you have seen is\na straight line graph so over here,\nyou can calculate the value of y with respect to the value\nof x where as in logistic regression because of that.\nThe got was a Escobar you can see the sigmoid curve.\nSo using the sigmoid function You can predict\nyour y-values moving the I let us see the various use cases\nwhere in logistic regression is implemented in real life.\nSo the very first is weather prediction now\nlargest aggression helps you to predict your weather.\nFor example, it is used to predict\nwhether it is raining or not whether it is sunny.\nIs it cloudy or not?\nSo all these things can be predicted\nusing logistic regression.\nWhere as you need to keep in mind\nthat both linear regression.\nAnd logistic regression can be used in predicting the weather.\nSo in that case linear equation helps you to predict\nwhat will be the temperature tomorrow\nwhereas logistic regression will only tell you\nwhich is going to rain or not or whether it's cloudy or not,\nwhich is going to snow or not.\nSo these values are discrete.\nWhereas if you apply linear regression you\nthe predicting things like what is the temperature tomorrow\nor what is the temperature day after tomorrow\nand all those thing?\nSo these are the slight differences\nbetween linear regression\nand logistic regression the moving ahead.\nWe have classification problem.\nSighs on performs multi-class classification.\nSo here it can help you tell whether it's a bird.\nIt's not a bird.\nThen you classify different kind of mammals.\nLet's say whether it's a dog or it's not a dog similarly.\nYou can check it for reptile\nwhether it's a reptile or not a reptile.\nSo in logistic regression,\nit can perform multi-class classification.\nSo this point I've already discussed\nthat it is used in classification problems next.\nIt also helps you to determine the illness as well.\nSo let me take an example.\nLet's say a patient goes for a routine check up in hospital.\nSo what doctor will do it,\nit will perform various tests on the patient and will check\nwhether the patient is actually l or not.\nSo what will be the features\nso doctor can check the sugar level\nthe blood pressure then what is the age of the patient?\nIs it very small or is it old person then?\nWhat is the previous medical history of the patient\nand all of these features will be recorded by the doctor\nand finally doctor checks the patient data and Data -\nthe outcome of an illness and the severity of illness.\nSo using all the data a doctor can identify\nwith A patient is ill or not.\nSo these are the various use cases\nin which you can use logistic regression now,\nI guess enough of theory part.\nSo let's move ahead and see some of the Practical implementation\nof logistic regression so over here,\nI be implementing two projects\nwhen I have the data set\nof Titanic so over here will predict what factors made\npeople more likely to survive the sinking of the Titanic ship\nand my second project will see the data analysis\non the SUV cars so over here we have the data of the SUV cars\nwho can purchase it.\nAnd what factors made people more interested in buying SUV?\nSo these will be the major questions as\nto why you should Implement\nlogistic regression and what output will you get by it?\nSo let's start by the very first project\nthat is Titanic data analysis.\nSo some of you might know\nthat there was a ship called as Titanic\nwith basically hit an iceberg\nand it sunk to the bottom of the ocean and it was\na big disaster at that time\nbecause it was the first voyage of the ship\nand it was supposed to be really really strongly built and one\nof the best ships of that time.\nSo it was a big Disaster\nof that time and of course there is a movie about this as well.\nSo many of you might have washed it.\nSo what we have we have data of the passengers those\nwho survived and those\nwho did not survive in this particular tragedy.\nSo what you have to do you have to look at this data\nand analyze which factors would have been contributed\nthe most to the chances\nof a person survival on the ship or not.\nSo using the logistic regression, we can predict\nwhether the person survived\nor the person died now apart from this.\nWe also have a look with the various features\nalong with that.\nSo first, let us explore The data set so over here.\nWe have the index value then the First Column\nis passenger ID.\nThen my next column is survived.\nSo over here,\nwe have two values a 0 and a 1 so 0 stands\nfor did not survive and one stands for survive.\nSo this column is categorical\nwhere the values are discrete next.\nWe have passenger class so over here,\nwe have three values 1 2 and 3.\nSo this basically tells you that\nwhether a passengers travelling in the first class second class\nor third class,\nthen we have the name of the We\nhave the six or you can see the gender of the passenger\nwhere the passenger is a male or female.\nThen we have the age we had sip SP.\nSo this basically means the number of siblings\nor the spouses aboard the Titanic so over here,\nwe have values such as 1 0 and so on then we have\nParts apart is basically the number of parents\nor children aboard the Titanic so over here,\nwe also have some values\nthen we have the ticket number.\nWe have the fair.\nWe have the table number and we have the embarked column.\nSo in my inbox column,\nwe have three values we have SC and Q.\nSo as basically stands\nfor Southampton C stands for Cherbourg\nand Q stands for Cubans down.\nSo these are the features\nthat will be applying our model on so here\nwe'll perform various steps\nand then we'll be implementing logistic regression.\nSo now these are the various steps\nwhich are required to implement any algorithm.\nSo now in our case we are implementing\nlogistic regression soft.\nVery first step is to collect your data\nor to import the libraries\nthat are used for collecting your data.\nAnd then taking it forward then my second step is to analyze\nyour data so over here I can go to the various fields\nand then I can analyze the data.\nI can check that the females\nor children survive better than the males\nor did the rich passenger survived more\nthan the poor passenger or did the money matter as in\nwho paid mode to get into the ship\nwith the evacuated first?\nAnd what about the workers does the worker survived\nor what is the survival rate\nif you were the worker in the ship and not just\na traveling passenger?\nSo all of these are very very and questions\nand you would be going through all of them one by one.\nSo in this stage,\nyou need to analyze our data\nand explore your data as much as you can then my third step is\nto Wrangle your data now\ndata wrangling basically means cleaning your data so over here,\nyou can simply remove the unnecessary items or\nif you have a null values in the data set.\nYou can just clear that data and then you can take it forward.\nSo in this step you can build your model\nusing the train data set\nand then you can test it\nusing a test so over here you will be performing a split\nwhich basically Get your data set into training\nand testing data set and find you will check the accuracy.\nSo as to ensure\nhow much accurate your values are.\nSo I hope you guys got these five steps\nthat you're going to implement in logistic regression.\nSo now let's go into all these steps in detail.\nSo number one.\nWe have to collect your data\nor you can say import the libraries.\nSo it may show you the implementation part as well.\nSo I just open my jupyter notebook\nand I just Implement all of these steps side by side.\nSo guys this is my jupyter notebook.\nSo first, let me just rename jupyter notebook to let's say\nTitanic data analysis.\nNow a full step was to import all the libraries\nand collect the data.\nSo let me just import all the library's first.\nSo first of all, I'll import pandas.\nSo pandas is used for data analysis.\nSo I'll say import pandas as PD then I will be importing numpy.\nSo I'll say import numpy as NP so number is a library in Python\nwhich basically stands for numerical Python\nand it is widely used to perform any scientific computation.\nNext.\nWe will be importing Seaborn.\nSo c 1 is a library\nfor statistical plotting so Say import Seaborn as SNS.\nI'll also import matplotlib.\nSo matplotlib library is again for plotting.\nSo I'll say import matplotlib dot Pi plot\nas PLT now to run this library in jupyter Notebook all I have\nto write in his percentage matplotlib in line.\nNext I will be importing one module as well.\nSo as to calculate the basic mathematical functions,\nso I'll say import maths.\nSo these are the libraries\nthat I will be needing in this Titanic data analysis.\nSo now let me just import my data set.\nSo I'll take a variable.\nLet's say Titanic data and using the pandas.\nI will just read my CSV or you can see the data set.\nI like the name of my data set that is Titanic dot CSV.\nNow.\nI have already showed you the data set so over here.\nLet me just bring the top 10 rows.\nSo for that I will just say\nI take the variable Titanic data dot head\nand I'll say the top ten rules.\nSo now I'll just run this\nso to run this style is have to press shift + enter\nor else you can just directly click on this cell so over here.\nI have the index.\nWe have the passenger ID, which is nothing.\nBut again the index\nwhich is starting from 1 then we have the survived column\nwhich has a category.\nCall values or you can say the discrete values,\nwhich is in the form of 0 or 1.\nThen we have the passenger class.\nWe have the name of the passenger sex age and so on.\nSo this is the data set\nthat I will be going forward\nwith next let us print the number of passengers\nwhich are there in this original data frame for that.\nI'll just simply type in print.\nI'll say a number of passengers.\nAnd using the length function,\nI can calculate the total length.\nSo I'll say length\nand inside this I'll be passing this variable\nbecause Titanic data, so I'll just copy it from here.\nI'll just paste it dot index\nand next set me just bring this one.\nSo here the number of passengers\nwhich are there\nin the original data set we have is 891 so around\nthis number would traveling in the Titanic ship so over here,\nmy first step is done\nwhere you have just collected data imported all the libraries\nand find out the total number of passengers,\nwhich are Titanic so now let me just go back\nto presentation and let's see.\nWhat is my next step.\nSo we're done with the collecting data.\nNext step is to analyze your data so over here\nwill be creating different plots to check the relationship\nbetween variables as\nin how one variable is affecting the other\nso you can simply explore your data set by making use\nof various columns\nand then you can plot a graph between them.\nSo you can either plot a correlation graph.\nYou can plot a distribution curve.\nIt's up to you guys.\nSo let me just go back\nto my jupyter notebook and let me analyze some of the data.\nOver here.\nMy second part is to analyze data.\nSo I just put this in headed to now to put this in here\nto I just have to go on code click on mark down\nand I just run this so first\nlet us plot account plot\nwhere you can pay between the passengers\nwho survived and who did not survive.\nSo for that I will be using the Seabourn Library so over\nhere I have imported Seaborn as SNS\nso I don't have to write the whole name.\nI'll simply say SNS dot count plot.\nI say axis with the survive and the data\nthat I'll be using is the Titanic data\nor you can say the name of variable in which you\nhave store your data set.\nSo now let me just run this\nso who were here as you can see I have survived column on my x\naxis and on the y axis.\nI have the count.\nSo zero basically stands for did not survive\nand one stands for the passengers\nwho did survive so over here,\nyou can see that around 550 of the passengers\nwho did not survive and they were around 350 passengers\nwho only survive so here you can basically conclude.\nThere are very less survivors than on survivors.\nSo this was the very first plot now there is not another plot\nto compare the sex as to whether out of all the passengers\nwho survived and who did not survive.\nHow many were men and how many were female\nso to do that?\nI'll simply say SNS dot count plot.\nI add the Hue as six so I want to know\nhow many females and how many male survive\nthen I'll be specifying the data.\nSo I'm using Titanic data set and let me just run\nthis you have done a mistake\nover here so over here you\ncan see I have survived column on the x-axis\nand I have the count on the why now.\nSo have you color stands for your male passengers\nand orange stands for your female?\nSo as you can see here the passengers\nwho did not survive\nthat has a value 0 so we can see that.\nMajority of males did not survive and if we see the people\nwho survived here,\nwe can see the majority of female survive.\nSo this basically concludes the gender of the survival rate.\nSo it appears on average women were more than three\ntimes more likely to survive than men next.\nLet us plot another plot\nwhere we have the Hue as the passenger class so over\nhere we can see which class at the passenger was traveling in\nwhether it was traveling in class 1 2 or 3.\nSo for that I just arrived the same command.\nI will say as soon as.com plot.\nI gave my x-axis as a family.\nI'll change my Hue to passenger class.\nSo my variable named as PE class.\nAnd the data said\nthat I'll be using this Titanic data.\nSo this is my result\nso over here you can see I have blue for first-class orange\nfor second class and green for the third class.\nSo here the passengers\nwho did not survive a majorly of the third class\nor you can say the lowest class\nor the cheapest class to get into the dynamic and the people\nwho did survive majorly belong to the higher classes.\nSo here 1 &amp; 2 has more eyes than the passenger\nwho were traveling in the third class.\nSo here we have computed that the passengers\nwho did not survive a majorly of third.\nOr you can see the lowest class\nand the passengers who were traveling\nin first and second class would tend to survive mode next.\nI just got a graph for the age distribution over here.\nI can simply use my data.\nSo we'll be using pandas library for this.\nI will declare an array and I'll pass in the column.\nThat is H.\nSo I plot and I want a histogram.\nSo I'll see plot da test.\nSo you can notice over here\nthat we have more of young passengers,\nor you can see the children between the ages 0 to 10\nand then we have the average people\nand if you go ahead Lester would be the population.\nSo this is the analysis on the age column.\nSo we saw that we have\nmore young passengers and more video courage passengers\nwhich are traveling in the Titanic.\nSo next let me plot a graph of fare as well.\nSo I'll say Titanic data.\nI say fair and again,\nI've got a histogram so I'll say hissed.\nSo here you can see the fair size is\nbetween zero to hundred now.\nLet me add the bin size.\nSo as to make it more clear over here,\nI'll say Ben is equals to let's\nsay 20 and I'll increase the figure size as well.\nSo I'll say fixed size.\nLet's say I'll give the dimensions as 10 by 5.\nSo it is bins.\nSo this is more clear now next.\nIt is analyzed the other columns as well.\nSo I'll just type in Titanic data\nand I want the information as to what all columns are left.\nSo here we have passenger ID,\nwhich I guess it's of no use then we have see\nhow many passengers survived and how many did not we\nalso do the analysis on the gender basis.\nWe saw with a female tend to survive more\nor the maintain to survive more then we saw the passenger class\nwhere the passenger is traveling in the first class second class\nor third class.\nThen we have the name.\nSo in name, we cannot do any analysis.\nWe saw the sex we saw the ages.\nWell, then we have sea bass P.\nSo this stands for the number of siblings or the spouse is\nwhich Are aboard the Titanic so let us do this as well.\nSo I'll say SNS dot count plot.\nI mentioned X SC SP.\nAnd I will be using the Titanic data\nso you can see the plot\nover here so over here you can conclude that.\nIt has the maximum value on zero so we can conclude\nthat neither children nor a spouse was\non board the Titanic now second most highest value is 1\nand then we have various values for 2 3 4 and so on next\nif I go above the store this column as well.\nSimilarly can do four parts.\nSo next we have part\nso you can see the number of parents or children\nwhich are both the Titanic so similarly can do.\nIsrael then we have the ticket number.\nSo I don't think so.\nAny analysis is required for Ticket.\nThen we have fears of a we have already discussed as\nin the people would tend to travel in the first class.\nYou will pay the highest view then we have the cable number\nand we have embarked.\nSo these are the columns\nthat will be doing data wrangling on\nso we have analyzed the data\nand we have seen quite a few graphs\nin which we can conclude which variable is better than another\nor what is the relationship the whole third step\nis my data wrangling so data wrangling basically\nmeans Cleaning your data.\nSo if you have a large data set,\nyou might be having some null values\nor you can say n values.\nSo it's very important\nthat you remove all the unnecessary items\nthat are present in your data set.\nSo removing this directly affects your accuracy.\nSo I just go ahead and clean my data\nby removing all the Nan values and unnecessary columns,\nwhich has a null value in the data set\nthe next time you're performing data wrangling.\nSupposed to fall I'll check\nwhether my dataset is null or not.\nSo I'll say Titanic data,\nwhich is the name of my data set and I'll say is null.\nSo this will basically tell me what all values are null\nand will return me a Boolean result.\nSo this basically checks the missing data\nand your result will be in Boolean format\nas in the result will be true or false so Falls mean\nif it is not null and true means\nif it is null,\nso let me just run this.\nOver here you can see the values as false or true.\nSo Falls is where the value is not null and true is\nwhere the value is none.\nSo over here you can see in the cabin column.\nWe have the very first value\nwhich is null so we have to do something on this so you can see\nthat we have a large data set.\nSo the counting does not stop\nand we can actually see the some of it.\nWe can actually print the number of passengers\nwho have the Nan value in each column.\nSo I say Titanic underscore data is null\nand I want the sum of it.\nThey've got some so this is basically print the number\nof passengers who have the n n values in each column\nso we can see\nthat we have missing values in each column that is 177.\nThen we have the maximum value in the cave in column\nand we have very Less in the Embark column.\nThat is 2 so here\nif you don't want to see this numbers,\nyou can also plot a heat map\nand then you can visually analyze it so let me just do\nthat as well.\nSo I'll say SNSD heat map.\nand say why tick labels False child has run this\nas we have already seen\nthat there were three columns\nin which missing data value was present.\nSo this might be age so over here almost 20% of each column\nhas a missing value then we have the caping columns.\nSo this is quite a large value\nand then we have two values for embark column as well.\nAdd a see map for color coding.\nSo I'll say see map.\nSo if I do this\nso the graph becomes more attractive so over here\nyellow stands for Drew or you can say the values are null.\nSo here we have computed\nthat we have the missing value of H. We have a lot\nof missing values in the cabin column\nand we have very less value,\nwhich is not even visible in the Embark column as well.\nSo to remove these missing values,\nyou can either replace the values and you can put in\nsome dummy values to it or you can simply drop the column.\nSo here let us suppose pick the age column.\nSo first, let me just plot a box plot\nand they will analyze with having a column as age\nso I'll say SNS dot box plot.\nI'll say x is equals to passenger class.\nSo it's PE class.\nI'll say Y is equal to H and the data set\nthat I'll be using is Titanic side.\nSo I'll say the data is goes to Titanic data.\nYou can see the edge\nin first class and second class tends to be more older rather\nthan we have it in the third place.\nWell that depends On the experience\nhow much you earn on might be there any number of reasons?\nSo here we concluded\nthat passengers\nwho were traveling in class one and class two a tend\nto be older than what we have in the class 3 so we have found\nthat we have some missing values in EM.\nNow one way is to either just drop the column\nor you can just simply fill in some values to them.\nSo this method is called as imputation now\nto perform data wrangling\nor cleaning it is for spring the head of the data set.\nSo I'll say Titanic not head so it's Titanic.\nFor data, let's say I just want the five rows.\nSo here we have survived which is again categorical.\nSo in this particular column,\nI can apply logic to progression.\nSo this can be my y value or the value\nthat you need to predict.\nThen we have the passenger class.\nWe have the name then we have ticket number Fair\ngiven so over here.\nWe have seen that in keeping.\nWe have a lot of null values or you can say that any invalid\nwhich is quite visible as well.\nSo first of all,\nwe'll just drop this column for dropping it.\nI'll just say Titanic underscore data.\nAnd I'll simply type in drop and the column\nwhich I need to drop so I have to drop the cable column.\nI mention the access equals to 1 and I'll say\nin place also to true.\nSo now again,\nI just print the head and a to see whether this column\nhas been removed from the data set or not.\nSo I'll say Titanic dot head.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe don't have given column anymore.\nNow, you can also drop the na values.\nSo I'll say Titanic data dot drop all the any values\nor you can say Nan\nwhich is not a number and I will say in place is equal to True.\nLet's Titanic.\nSo over here,\nlet me again plot the heat map and let's say what the values\nwhich will be for showing a lot of null values.\nHas it been removed or not.\nSo I'll say SNSD heat map.\nI'll pass in the data set.\nI'll check it is null I say why dick labels is equal to false.\nAnd I don't want color coding.\nSo again I say false.\nSo this will basically help me to check\nwhether my values has been removed\nfrom the data set or not.\nSo as you can see here, I don't have any null values.\nSo it's entirely black now.\nYou can actually know the some as well.\nSo I'll just go above So I'll just copy this part\nand I just use the sum function to calculate the sum.\nSo here the tells me\nthat data set is green as in the data set does not contain\nany null value or any n value.\nSo now we have R Angela data.\nYou can see cleaner data.\nSo here we have done just one step in data wrangling\nthat is just removing one column out of it.\nNow you can do a lot of things you can actually\nfill in the values with some other values\nor you can just calculate the mean\nand then you can just fit in the null values.\nBut now if I see my data set,\nso I'll say Titanic data dot head.\nBut now if I see you over here I have a lot of string values.\nSo this has to be converted to a categorical variables\nin order to implement logistic regression.\nSo what we will do we will convert this\nto categorical variable\ninto some dummy variables and this can be done using pandas\nbecause logistic regression just take two values.\nSo whenever you apply machine learning you need to make sure\nthat there are no string values present\nbecause it won't be taking these as your input variables.\nSo using string you don't have to predict anything but\nin my case I have the survived columns 2210 how many?\nPeople tend to survive\nand how men did not so 0 stands for did not survive\nand one stands for survive.\nSo now let me just convert these variables\ninto dummy variables.\nSo I'll just use pandas and I say PD not get dummies.\nYou can simply press tab to autocomplete\nand say Titanic data and I'll pass the sex\nso you can just simply click on shift + tab to get\nmore information on this.\nSo here we have the type data frame\nand we have the passenger ID survived and passenger class.\nSo if Run this you'll see\nthat 0 basically stands for not a female and once and\nfor it is a female similarly for male zero Stanford's not made\nand one Stanford main now,\nwe don't require both these columns\nbecause one column itself is enough to tell us\nwhether it's male or you can say female or not.\nSo let's say if I want to keep only mail I will say\nif the value of mail is 1\nso it is definitely a maid and is not a female.\nSo that is how you don't need both of these values.\nSo for that I just remove the First Column,\nlet's say a female so I'll say drop first.\nAndrew it has given me just one column\nwhich is male and has a value 0 and 1.\nLet me just set this as a variable hsx so over here\nI can say sex dot head.\nI'll just want to see the first pie Bros.\nSorry, it's Dot.\nSo this is how my data looks like now here.\nWe have done it for sex.\nThen we have the numerical values in age.\nWe have the numerical values in spouses.\nThen we have the ticket number.\nWe have the pair and we have embarked as well.\nSo in Embark, the values are in SC and Q.\nSo here also we can apply this get dummy function.\nSo let's say I will take a variable.\nLet's say Embark.\nI'll use the pandas Library.\nI need the column name that is embarked.\nLet me just print the head of it.\nSo I'll say Embark dot head so over here.\nWe have c q and s now here also we can drop the First Column\nbecause these two values are enough\nwith the passenger is either traveling for Q\nthat is toonstone S4 sound time\nand if both the values are 0 then definitely\nthe passenger is from Cherbourg.\nThat is the third value\nso you can again drop the first value so I'll say drop.\nLet me just run this\nso this is how my output looks like now similarly.\nYou can do it for passenger class as well.\nSo here also we have three classes one two,\nand three so I'll just copy the whole statement.\nSo let's say I want the variable name.\nLet's say PCL.\nI'll pass in the column name\nthat is PE class and I'll just drop the First Column.\nSo here also the values will be 1 2 or 3\nand I'll just remove the First Column.\nSo here we just left with two and three so\nif both the values are 0 then definitely the passengers\ntraveling the first class now,\nwe have made the values as categorical now,\nmy next step would be to concatenate all\nthese new rows into a data set.\nWe can see Titanic data using the pandas will just concatenate\nall these columns.\nSo I'll say p Dot.\nOne cat and then say we have to concatenate sex.\nWe have to concatenate Embark and PCL\nand then I will mention the access to one.\nI'll just run this can you\nto print the head so over here you can see\nthat these columns have been added over here.\nSo we have the mail column with basically tells\nwhere the person is male\nor it's a female then we have the Embark\nwhich is basically q\nand s so if it's traveling\nfrom Queenstown value would be one else it\nwould be 0 and If both of these values are zeroed,\nit is definitely traveling from Cherbourg.\nThen we have the passenger class as 2 and 3.\nSo the value of both\nthese is 0 then passengers travelling in class one.\nSo I hope you got this till now now these are\nthe irrelevant columns\nthat we have done over here\nso we can just drop these columns will drop\nin PE class the embarked column and the sex column.\nSo I'll just type\nin Titanic data dot drop and mention the columns\nthat I want to drop.\nSo I say And even lead the passenger ID\nbecause it's nothing but just the index value\nwhich is starting from one.\nSo I'll drop this as well then I don't want name as well.\nSo I'll delete name as well.\nThen what else we can drop we can drop the ticket as well.\nAnd then I'll just mention the axis L say\nin place is equal to True.\nOkay, so the my column name starts uppercase.\nSo these has been dropped now,\nlet me just bring my data set again.\nSo this is my final leadership guys.\nWe have the survived column\nwhich has the value zero and one then we have the passenger class\nor we forgot to drop this as well.\nSo no worries.\nI'll drop this again.\nSo now let me just run this.\nSo over here we have the survive.\nWe have the H we have the same SP.\nWe have the parts.\nWe have Fair mail and these we have just converted.\nSo here we have just performed data angling\nfor you can see clean the data\nand then we have just converted the values of gender\nto male then embarked to qns\nand the passenger Class 2 2 &amp; 3.\nSo this was all about my data wrangling\nor just cleaning the data then my next up is training\nand testing your data.\nSo here we will split the data set into train subset\nand test steps.\nAnd then what we'll do we'll build a model\non the train data\nand then predict the output on your test data set.\nSo let me just go back to Jupiter\nand it is implement this as well over here.\nI need to train my data set.\nSo I'll just put this indeed heading 3.\nSo over you need to Define your dependent variable\nand independent variable.\nSo here my Y is the output for you can say the value\nthat I need to predict so over here,\nI will write Titanic data.\nI'll take the column which is survive.\nSo basically I have to predict this column\nwhether the passenger survived or not.\nAnd as you can see we have the discrete outcome,\nwhich is in the form of 0 and 1 and rest all the things we\ncan take it as a features or you can say independent variable.\nSo I'll say Titanic data.\nNot a drop,\nso we just simply drop the survive\nand all the other columns will be my independent variable.\nSo everything else are the features which leads\nto the survival rate.\nSo once we have defined the independent variable\nand the dependent variable next step is to split\nyour data into training and testing subset.\nSo for that we will be using SK loan.\nI just type in from sklearn dot cross validation.\nimport train display Now here\nif you just click on shift and tab,\nyou can go to the documentation\nand you can just see the examples over here.\nAnd she can blast open it\nand then I just go to examples and see\nhow you can split your data.\nSo over here you have extra next test why drain\nwhy test and then using the string test platelet\nand just passing\nyour independent variable and dependent variable\nand just Define a size and a random straight to it.\nSo, let me just copy this and I'll just paste over here.\nOver here, we'll train test.\nThen we have the dependent variable train and test\nand using the split function will pass in the independent\nand dependent variable and then we'll set a split size.\nSo let's say I'll put it up 0.3.\nSo this basically means\nthat your data set is divided in 0.3\nthat is in 70/30 ratio.\nAnd then I can add any random straight to it.\nSo let's say I'm applying one this is not necessary.\nIf you want the same result as that of mine,\nyou can add the random stream.\nSo this would basically take exactly the same sample\nevery Next I have to train and predict by creating a model.\nSo here logistic regression will graph\nfrom the linear regression.\nSo next I'll just type in\nfrom SK loan dot linear model import logistic regression.\nNext I'll just create\nthe instance of this logistic regression model.\nSo I'll say log model is equals to largest aggression now.\nI just need to fit my model.\nSo I'll say log model dot fit\nand I'll just pass in my ex train.\nAnd why it rain?\nIt gives me all the details of logistic regression.\nSo here it gives me the class made dual fit intercept\nand all those things then what I need to do,\nI need to make prediction.\nSo I will take a variable insect addictions and I'll pass\non the model to it.\nSo I'll say log model dot protect\nand I'll pass in the value that is X test.\nSo here we have just created a model fit\nthat model and then we had made predictions.\nSo now to evaluate how my model has been performing.\nSo you can simply calculate the accuracy\nor you can also calculate a classification report.\nSo don't worry guys.\nI'll be showing both of these methods.\nSo I'll say\nfrom sklearn dot matrix input classification report.\nAre you start fishing report?\nAnd inside this I'll be passing in why test and the predictions?\nSo guys this is my classification report.\nSo over here, I have the Precision.\nI have the recall.\nWe have the advanced code and then we have support.\nSo here we have the value of decision as 75 72 and 73,\nwhich is not that bad now\nin order to calculate the accuracy as well.\nYou can also use the concept of confusion Matrix.\nSo if you want to print the confusion Matrix,\nI will simply say\nfrom sklearn dot matrix import confusion Matrix first of all,\nand then we'll just print this So\nhow am I function has been imported successfully\nso is a confusion Matrix.\nAnd I'll again passing the same variables\nwhich is why test and predictions.\nSo I hope you guys already know the concept of confusion Matrix.\nSo can you guys give me a quick confirmation as\nto whether you guys\nremember this confusion Matrix concept or not?\nSo if not,\nI can just quickly summarize this as well.\nOkay charged with you say\nso yes.\nOkay.\nSo what is not clear with this?\nSo I'll just tell you in a brief what\nconfusion Matrix is all about?\nSo confusion Matrix is nothing but a 2 by 2 Matrix\nwhich has a four outcomes this basic tells us\nthat how accurate your values are.\nSo here we have the column as predicted.\nNo predicted Y and we have actual know an actual.\nYes.\nSo this is the concept of confusion Matrix.\nSo here let me just fade in these values\nwhich we have just calculated.\nSo here we have 105.\n105 2125 and 63 So as you can see here,\nwe have got four outcomes now\n105 is the value where a model has predicted.\nNo, and in reality.\nIt was also a no so\nwhere we have predicted know an actual know similarly.\nWe have 63 as a predicted.\nYes.\nSo here the model predicted.\nYes, and actually also it was yes.\nSo in order to calculate the accuracy,\nyou just need to add the sum\nof these two values and divide the whole by the some.\nSo here these two values tells me where the order has.\nWe predicted the correct output.\nSo this value is also called as true-\nThis is called as false positive.\nThis is called as true positive\nand this is called as false negative.\nNow in order to calculate the accuracy.\nYou don't have to do it manually.\nSo in Python,\nyou can just import accuracy score function\nand you can get the results from that.\nSo I'll just do that as well.\nSo I'll say from sklearn dot-matrix import accuracy score\nand I'll simply print the accuracy.\nI'm passing the same variables.\nThat is why I test and predictions so over here.\nIt tells me the accuracy as 78 which is quite good so over here\nif you want to do it manually we have 2 plus these two numbers,\nwhich is 105 263.\nSo this comes out to almost 168 and then you have to divide\nby the sum of all the phone numbers.\nSo 105 plus 63 plus 21 plus 25,\nso this gives me a result of to 1/4.\nSo now if you divide\nthese two number you'll get the same accuracy that is 98%\nor you can say .78.\nSo that is how you can calculate the accuracy.\nSo now let me just go back to my presentation and let's see\nwhat all we have covered till now.\nSo here we have First Data data into train and test subset then\nwe have build a model on the train data\nand then predicted the output on the test data set\nand then my fifth step is to check the accuracy.\nSo here we have\ncalculator accuracy to almost seventy eight percent,\nwhich is quite good.\nYou cannot say that accuracy is bad.\nSo here tells me how accurate your results.\nSo him accuracy skoda finds\nthat enhanced got a good accuracy.\nSo now moving ahead.\nLet us see the second project that is SUV data analysis.\nSo in this a car company has released new SUV in the market\nand using the previous data about the sales of their SUV.\nThey want to predict the category of people\nwho might be interested in buying this.\nSo using the logistic regression,\nyou need to find what factors made people more interested\nin buying this SUV.\nSo for this let us hear data set where I have user ID I have\nOf gender as male and female then we have the age.\nWe have the estimated salary\nand then we have the purchased column.\nSo this is my discreet column\nor you can see the categorical column.\nSo here we just have the value\nthat is 0 and 1 and this column we need to predict\nwhether a person can actually purchase a SUV or Not.\nSo based on these factors, we will be deciding\nwhether a person can actually purchase SUV or not.\nSo we know the salary of a person we know the age\nand using these we can predict\nwhether person can actually purchase SUV\non Let me just go to my jupyter.\nNotebook and has implemented a logistic regression.\nSo guys, I will not be going through all the details\nof data cleaning and analyzing the part start part.\nI'll just leave it on you.\nSo just go ahead and practice as much as you can.\nAlright, so the second project is SUV predictions.\nAlright, so first of all,\nI have to import all the libraries\nso I say import numpy SNP and similarly.\nI'll do the rest of it.\nAlright, so now let me just bring the head\nof this data set.\nSo this give already seen that we have columns as user ID.\nWe have gender.\nWe have the age.\nWe have the salary and then we have to calculate\nwhether person can actually purchase a SUV or not.\nSo now let us just simply go on to the algorithm part.\nSo we'll directly start off with the logistic regression\nhow you can train a model so for doing all those things\nwe first need to Define an independent variable\nand a dependent variable.\nSo in this case,\nI want my ex at is an independent variable is\na data set.\nI lock so here I will specify sighing all the rows.\nSo cool and basically stands for that and in the columns,\nI want only two and three dot values.\nSo here we should fetch me all the rows\nand only the second and third column which is age\nand estimated salary.\nSo these are the factors\nwhich will be used to predict the dependent variable\nthat is purchase.\nSo here my dependent variable is purchase\nany dependent variable is of age and salary.\nSo I'll say later said dot\nI log I'll have all the rows and add just one for column.\nThat is my position.\nIs column values.\nAll right, so I just forgot\nwhen one square bracket over here.\nAlright so over here.\nI have defined my independent variable and dependent variable.\nSo here my independent variable is age and salary\nand dependent variable is the column purchase.\nNow, you must be wondering what is this?\nI lock function.\nSo I look function is basically an index of a panda's data frame\nand it is used for integer based indexing\nor you can also say selection by index now,\nlet me just bring these independent variables\nand dependent variable.\nSo if I bring the independent variable I have aged as\nwell as a salary next.\nLet me print the dependent variable as well.\nSo over here you can see I just have the values in 0\nand 1 so 0 stands for did not purchase next.\nLet me just divide my data set into training and test subset.\nSo I'll simply write in\nfrom SK loaned cross plate dot cross validation.\nimport rain test next I just press shift and tab\nand over here.\nI will go to the examples and just copy the same line.\nSo I'll just copy this.\nI'll move the points now.\nI want to text size to be let's see 25,\nso I have divided the trained and tested in 75/25 ratio.\nNow, let's say I'll take the random set of 0 So\nRandom State basically ensures the same result\nor you can say the same samples taken whenever you run the code.\nSo let me just run this now.\nYou can also scale your input values\nfor better performing\nand this can be done using standard scale.\nOh, so let me do that as well.\nSo I'll say from sklearn pre-processing.\nImport standard scalar now.\nWhy do we scale it now?\nIf you see a data set we are dealing with large numbers.\nWell, although we are using a very small data set.\nSo whenever you're working in a prod environment,\nyou'll be working with large data set\nwe will be using thousands\nand hundred thousands of do people's so they're scaling\ndown will definitely affect the performance\nby a large extent.\nSo here let me just show you\nhow you can scale down these input values and then\nthe pre-processing contains all your methods &amp; functionality,\nwhich is required to transform your data.\nSo now let us scale down\nfor tests as well as their training data set.\nSo else First Make an instance of it.\nSo I'll say standard scalar\nthen I'll have Xtreme sasc dot fit fit underscore transform.\nI'll pass in my Xtreme variable.\nAnd similarly I can do it for test wherein\nI'll pass the X test.\nAll right.\nNow my next step is to import logistic regression.\nSo I'll simply apply logistically creation\nby first importing it\nso I'll say from sklearn sklearn\nthe linear model import logistic regression over here.\nI'll be using classifier.\nSo is a classifier DOT is equals\nto largest aggression so over here,\nI just make an instance of it.\nSo I'll say logistic regression and over here.\nI just pass in the random state,\nwhich is 0 No, I simply fit the model.\nAnd I simply pass in X train and white rain.\nSo here it tells me all the details\nof logistic regression.\nThen I have to predict the value.\nSo I'll say why I prayed it's equals to classifier.\nThen predict function and then I just pass in X test.\nSo now we have created the model.\nWe have scale down our input values.\nThen we have applied logistic regression.\nWe have predicted the values\nand now we want to know the accuracy.\nSo now the accuracy first we need to import accuracy scores.\nSo I'll say from sklearn dot-matrix import\nactually see school\nand using this function we can calculate the accuracy\nor you can manually do\nthat by creating a confusion Matrix.\nSo I'll just pass.\nmy lightest and my y predicted All right.\nSo over here I get the accuracy is 89%\nSo we want to know the accuracy in percentage.\nSo I just have to multiply it by a hundred and if I run this\nso it gives me 89%\nSo I hope you guys are clear\nwith whatever I have taught you today.\nSo here I have taken my independent variables as age\nand salary and then we have calculated\nthat how many people can purchase the SUV\nand then we have calculated our model by checking\nthe accuracy so over here we get the accuracy is 89\nwhich is great.\nAlright guys that is it for today.\nSo I'll Discuss\nwhat we have covered in today's training.\nFirst of all,\nwe had a quick introduction to what is regression\nand where their aggression is actually use then\nwe have understood the types of regression\nand then got into the details\nof what and why of logistic regression\nof compared linear was in logistic regression.\nIf you've also seen the various use cases\nwhere you can Implement logistic regression in real life\nand then we have picked up two projects\nthat is Titanic data analysis\nand SUV prediction so over here we have seen\nhow you can collect your data analyze your data then perform.\nModeling on that date that train the data test\nthe data and then finally have calculated the accuracy.\nSo in your SUV prediction,\nyou can actually analyze clean your data\nand you can do a lot of things\nso you can just go ahead pick up any data set\nand explore it as much as you can.\nWhat is classification.\nI hope every one of you must have used Gmail.\nSo how do you think the male is getting classified as a Spam\nor not spam mail?\nWell, there's But classification So\nWhat It Is Well classification is the process\nof dividing the data set into different categories\nor groups by adding label.\nIn other way,\nyou can say that it is a technique\nof categorizing the observation into different category.\nSo basically what you are doing is you are taking\nthe data analyzing it\nand on the basis of some condition\nyou finely divided into various categories.\nNow, why do we classify it?\nWell, we classify it to perform predictive analysis\non it like when you get\nthe mail the machine predicts it Be a Spam\nor not spam mail\nand on the basis of that prediction it\nadd the irrelevant or spam mail\nto the respective folder in general this classification.\nAlgorithm handled questions.\nLike is this data belongs to a category or B category?\nLike is this a male or is this a female something like that?\nI getting it?\nOkay fine.\nNow the question arises where will you use it?\nWell, you can use this of protection order to check\nwhether the transaction is genuine or not suppose.\nI am using a credit.\nHere in India now due\nto some reason I had to fly to Dubai now.\nIf I'm using the credit card over there,\nI will get a notification alert regarding my transaction.\nThey would ask me to confirm about the transaction.\nSo this is also kind of predictive analysis\nas the machine predicts\nthat something fishy is\nin the transaction as very for our ago.\nI made the transaction using the same credit card and India\nand 24 hour later.\nThe same credit card is being used for the payment in Dubai.\nSo the machine texts that something fishy is going on\nin the transaction.\nSo in order to confirm it it sends you a notification alert.\nAll right.\nWell, this is one of the use case of classification\nyou can even use it to classify different items\nlike fruits on the base of its taste color size\nor weight a machine well trained using\nthe classification algorithm can easily predict the class\nor the type of fruit whenever new data is given to it.\nNot just the fruit.\nIt can be any item.\nIt can be a car.\nIt can be a house.\nIt can be a signboard.\nOr anything.\nHave you noticed\nthat while you visit some sites\nor you try to login into some you get\na picture capture for that right\nwhere you have to identify\nwhether the given image is of a car or its of a pole or not?\nYou have to select it for example that 10 images\nand you're selecting three Mages out of it.\nSo in a way you are training the machine,\nright you're telling\nthat these three are the picture of a car\nand rest are not so\nwho knows you are training at for something big\nright?\nSo moving on ahead.\nLet's discuss the types of education online.\nWell, there are several different ways\nto perform the same tasks like in order to predict\nwhether a given person is a male\nor a female the machine had to be trained first.\nAll right,\nbut there are multiple ways to train the machine and you\ncan choose any one of them just for Predictive Analytics.\nThere are many different techniques,\nbut the most common of them all is the decision tree,\nwhich we'll cover in depth in today's session.\nSo it's a part of classification algorithm.\nWe have decision tree random Forest name buys.\nK-nearest neighbor Lodge\nis Regression linear regression support Vector machines\nand so on there are many.\nAlright, so let me give you an idea about few\nof them starting with decision tree.\nWell decision tree is a graphical representation\nof all the possible solution\nto a decision the decisions\nwhich are made they can be explained very easily.\nFor example here is a task,\nwhich says that should I go to a restaurant\nor should I buy a hamburger you are confused on that.\nSo for the artboard you will do you will create\na dish entry for it starting\nwith the root node will be first of all,\nyou will check whether you are hungry or not.\nAll right,\nif you're not hungry then just go back to sleep.\nRight?\nIf you are hungry\nand you have $25 then you will decide to go to restaurant\nand if you're hungry and you don't have $25,\nthen you will just go and buy a hamburger.\nThat's it.\nAll right.\nSo there's about decision tree now moving on ahead.\nLet's see.\nWhat is a random Forest.\nWell random Forest build multiple decision trees\nand merges them together to get a more accurate\nand stable production.\nAll right, most of the time random Forest is trained\nwith a bagging method.\nThe bragging method is based on the idea\nthat the combination\nof learning module increases the overall result.\nIf you are combining the learning from different models\nand then clubbing it together\nwhat it will do it will Increase the overall result fine.\nJust one more thing.\nIf the size of your data set is huge.\nThen in that case one single decision tree would lead\nto our Offutt model same way\nlike a single person might have its own perspective\non the complete population as a population is very huge.\nRight?\nHowever, if we implement the voting system and ask\ndifferent individual to interpret the data,\nthen we would be able to cover the pattern\nin a much meticulous way even from the diagram.\nYou can see that in section A\nwe have Howard large training data set what we do.\nWe first divide our training data set\ninto n sub-samples on it\nand we create a decision tree for each cell sample.\nNow in the B part what we do we take the vote\nout of every decision made by every decision tree.\nAnd finally we Club the vote to get\nthe random Forest dition fine.\nLet's move on ahead.\nNext.\nWe have neighbor Buys.\nSo name bias is a classification technique,\nwhich is based on Bayes theorem.\nIt assumes that it's\nof any particular feature in a class is completely unrelated\nto the presence\nof any other feature named buys is simple\nand easy to implement algorithm and due to a Simplicity\nthis algorithm might out perform more complex model\nwhen the size of the data set is not large enough.\nAll right, a classical use case\nof Navy bias is a document classification.\nAnd that what you do you determine\nwhether a given text corresponds\nto one or more categories in the Texas case,\nthe features used might be the presence or absence.\nAbsence of any keyword.\nSo this was about Nev from the diagram.\nYou can see that using neighbor buys.\nWe have to decide\nwhether we have a disease or not.\nFirst what we do we check the probability\nof having a disease\nand not having the disease right probability\nof having a disease is 0.1\nwhile on the other hand probability of not having\na disease is 0.9.\nOkay first, let's see\nwhen we have disease and we go to the doctor.\nAll right, so when we visited the doctor\nand the test is positive Adjective so probability\nof having a positive test\nwhen you're having a disease is 0.8 0 and probability\nof a negative test\nwhen you already have a disease that is 0.20.\nThis is also a false negative statement as the test\nis detecting negative,\nbut you still have the disease, right?\nSo it's a false negative statement.\nNow, let's move ahead\nwhen you don't have the disease at all.\nSo probability of not having a disease is 0.9.\nAnd when you visit the doctor and the doctor is like, yes,\nyou have the disease.\nBut you already know that you don't have the disease.\nSo it's a false positive statement.\nSo probability of having a disease when you actually\nknow there is no disease is 0.1 and probability\nof not having a disease\nwhen you actually know there is no disease.\nSo and the probability of it is around 0.90 fine.\nIt is same as probability of not having a disease even\nthe test is showing the same results\na true positive statement.\nSo it is 0.9.\nAll right.\nSo let's move on ahead and discuss about kn n algorithm.\nSo this KNN algorithm or the k-nearest neighbor,\nit stores all the available cases\nand classifies new cases based on the similarity measure the K\nin the KNN algorithm as the nearest neighbor,\nwe wish to take vote from for example,\nif k equal 1 then the object is simply assigned to the class\nof that single nearest neighbor from the diagram.\nYou can see the difference in the image\nwhen k equal 1 k equal 3 and k equal 5, right?\nWell the And systems\nare now able to use the k-nearest neighbor\nfor visual pattern recognization to scan\nand detect hidden packages in the bottom bin\nof a shopping cart at the checkout\nif an object is detected\nwhich matches exactly to the object listed\nin the database.\nThen the price of the spotted product could even\nautomatically be added to the customers Bill\nwhile this automated billing practice is not used\nextensively at this time,\nbut the technology has been developed\nand is available for use\nif you want you can just use It and yeah,\none more thing k-nearest neighbor is also used\nin retail to detect patterns\nin the credit card users many new transaction scrutinizing\nsoftware application use\nCayenne algorithms to analyze register data\nand spot unusual pattern\nthat indicates suspicious activity.\nFor example, if register data indicates\nthat a lot of customers information\nis being entered manually rather than through automated scanning\nand swapping then in that case.\nThis could indicate\nthat the employees were using the register.\nIn fact stealing customers personal information or\nif I register data indicates\nthat a particular good is being returned\nor exchanged multiple times.\nThis could indicate\nthat employees are misusing the return policy\nor trying to make money from doing the fake returns, right?\nSo this was about KNN algorithm.\nSo starting with what is decision tree,\nbut first, let me tell you why did we choose\nthe Gentry to start with?\nWell, these decision tree are really very easy to read\nand understand it belongs to one of The few models\nthat interpretable\nwhere you can understand exactly why the classifier has made\nthat particular decision right?\nLet me tell you a fact that for a given data set.\nYou cannot say\nthat this algorithm performs better than that.\nIt's like you cannot say that decision trees\nbetter than a buys\nor name biases performing better than decision tree.\nIt depends on the data set,\nright you have to apply hit and trial method\nwith all the algorithms one\nby one and then compare the result the model\nwhich gives the best result as the Order\nwhich you can use at for better accuracy\nfor your data set.\nAll right, so let's start with what is decision tree.\nWell a decision tree is a graphical representation\nof all the possible solution\nto our decision based on certain conditions.\nNow, you might be wondering why this thing is called\nas decision tree.\nWell, it is called so\nbecause it starts with the root\nand then branches off to a number of solution just\nlike a tree right even the tree starts from a roux\nand it starts growing its branches.\nAs once it gets bigger\nand bigger similarly in a decision tree.\nIt has a roux\nwhich keeps on growing with increasing number of decision\nand the conditions now,\nlet me tell you a real life scenario.\nI won't say that all of you,\nbut most of you must have used it.\nRemember whenever you dial the toll-free number\nof your credit card company,\nit redirects you\nto his intelligent computerised assistant\nwhere it asks you questions like,\npress one for English or press 2 for Henry,\npress 3 for this press 4 for that right now\nonce you select one now again,\nIt redirects you to a certain set\nof questions like press 1 for this press 1 for that\nand similarly, right?\nSo this keeps on repeating\nuntil you finally get to the right person, right?\nYou might think\nthat you are caught in a voicemail hell\nbut what the company was actually doing it\nwas just using a decision tree to get you to the right person.\nI lied.\nI'd like you to focus on this particular image\nfor a moment on this particular slide.\nYou can see I image where the task is.\nShould I accept a new job offer or not?\nAlright, so you have to decide that for That\nwhat you did you created a decision tree starting\nwith the base condition or the root node.\nWas that the basic salary\nor the minimum salary should be $50,000\nif it is not $50,000.\nThen you are not at all accepting the offer.\nAll right.\nSo if your salary is greater than $50,000,\nthen you will further check\nwhether the commute is more than one hour or not.\nIf it is more than one are you will just decline the offer\nif it is less than one hour,\nthen you are getting closer to accepting the job offer then\nfurther what you will do.\nYou will check whether the company is offering.\nFree coffee or not,\nright if the company is not offering the free coffee,\nthen you will just decline the offer\nand have fit as offering the free coffee.\nAnd yeah, you will happily accept the offer right?\nThis is just an example of a decision tree.\nNow, let's move ahead and understand a decision tree.\nWell, here is a sample data set\nthat I will be using it to explain you\nabout the decision tree.\nAll right in this data set each row is an example.\nAnd the first two columns provide features or attributes\nthat describes the data\nand the last column gives the label\nor the class we want to predict\nand if you like you can just modify this data\nby adding additional features\nand more example\nand our program will work in exactly the same way fine.\nNow this data set is pretty straightforward\nexcept for one thing.\nI hope you have noticed that it is not perfectly separable.\nLet me tell you something more about that as\nin the second and fifth examples they have the same features.\nBut different labels both have yellow as a Colour\nand diameter as three,\nbut the labels are mango and lemon right?\nLet's move on and see\nhow our decision tree handles this case.\nAll right, in order to build a tree will use a decision tree\nalgorithm called card this card algorithm\nstands for classification\nand regression tree algorithm online.\nLet's see a preview of how it works.\nAll right to begin with We'll add a root node\nfor the tree and all the nodes receive a list\nof rows as a input\nand the route will receive the entire training data set now\neach node will ask true and false question\nabout one other feature.\nAnd in response to that question will split\nor partition the data set into two different subsets\nthese subsets then become input to child node.\nWe are to the tree\nand the goal of the question is to finally unmix the labels\nas we proceed down or in other words to produce\nthe purest possible distribution of the labels at each node.\nFor example, the input of this node contains only.\nOne single type of label so we could say\nthat it's perfectly unmixed.\nThere is no uncertainty about the type of label\nas it consists of only grapes right\non the other hand the labels in this node are still mixed up.\nSo we would ask another question to further drill it down,\nright but before that we need to understand which question to ask\nand when and to do\nthat we need to conduct\nby how much question helps to unmix the label\nand we can quantify the amount of Uncertainty\nat a single node using a metric called gini impurity\nand we can quantify\nhow much a question reduces\nthat uncertainty using a concept called information game will use\nthese to select the best question to ask at each point.\nAnd then what we'll do we'll iterate the steps\nwill recursively build the tree\non each of the new node will continue dividing the data\nuntil there are no further question to ask\nand finally we reach to our Leaf.\nAlright, alright, so this was about decision tree.\nSo in order to create a diversion First of all\nwhat you have to do you have to identify\ndifferent set of questions\nthat you can ask to a tree like is this color green\nand what will be these question this question will be decided by\nyour data set like as this colored green\nas the diameter greater than equal to 3 is the color\nyellow right questions resembles to your data set remember that?\nAll right.\nSo if my color is green,\nthen what it will do it will divide into two part first.\nThe Green Mango will be in the true while on the false.\nWe have lemon and the map all right.\nAnd if the color is green\nor the diameter is greater than equal to 3\nor the color is yellow.\nNow let's move on\nand understand about decision tree terminologies.\nAlright, so starting\nwith root node root node is a base node of a tree\nthe entire tree starts from a root node.\nIn other words.\nIt is the first node of a tree it represents\nthe entire population or sample\nand this entire population is further segregated\nor divided into two or more homogeneous set.\nFine.\nNext is the leaf node.\nWell, Leaf node is the one\nwhen you reach at the end of the tree,\nright that is you cannot further segregated down\nto any other level.\nThat is the leaf node.\nNext is splitting splitting is dividing your root node\nor node into different sub part on the basis of some condition.\nAll right, then comes the branch or the sub tree.\nWell, this Branch or subtree gets formed\nwhen you split the tree suppose when you split a root node,\nit gets divided into two branches\nor two subtrees right next.\nThe concept of pruning.\nWell, you can say that pruning is just opposite\nof splitting what we are doing here.\nWe are just removing the sub node of a decision tree\nwill see more about pruning later in this session.\nAll right, let's move on ahead.\nNext is parent or child node.\nWell, first of all root node is always the parent node\nand all other nodes\nassociated with that is known as child node.\nWell, you can understand it in a way that all the top node\nbelongs to a parent node and all the bottom node\nwhich are derived from a Top node zhi node the node\nproducing a further note is a child node and the node\nwhich is producing.\nIt is a parent node simple concept, right?\nLet's use the cartel Gotham and design a tree manually.\nSo first of all,\nwhat you do you decide which question to ask\nand when so how will you do that?\nSo let's first of all visualize the decision tree.\nSo there's the decision tree which will be creating manually\nor like first of all,\nlet's have a look at the Data set you have\nOutlook temperature humidity and windy\nas you have different attributes on the basis of\nthat you have to predict that whether you can play or not.\nSo which one among them should you pick first answer determine\nthe best attribute that classifies the training data?\nAll right.\nSo how will you choose the best attribute\nor how does a tree decide\nwhere to split or how the tree will decide its root node?\nWell before we move on\nand split a tree there are some terminologies\nthat you should know.\nAll right first being the gini index.\nX so what is this gini Index?\nThis gini index is the measure of impurity or Purity used\nin building a decision Tree in cartel Gotham.\nAll right.\nNext is Information Gain this Information Gain is\nthe decrease in entropy\nafter data set is split on the basis of an attribute\nconstructing a decision tree is all about finding an attribute\nthat Returns the highest Information Gain.\nAll right, so you will be selecting the node\nthat would give you the highest Information Gain.\nAlright next is reduction in variance.\nReduction in variance is an algorithm which is used\nfor continuous Target variable or regression problems.\nThe split with lower variance is selected as a criteria to let\nthe population see in general term.\nWhat do you mean by variance?\nVariance is how much your data is wearing?\nRight?\nSo if your data is less impure or is more pure\nthan in that case the variation would be less\nas all the data almost similar, right?\nSo there's also a way of setting a tree the split\nwith lower variance\nis selected as the criteria to split the population.\nAll right.\nNext is the chi Square t Square.\nIt is an algorithm\nwhich is used to find out these statistical significance\nbetween the differences between sub nodes\nand the parent nodes fine.\nLet's move ahead now the main question is\nhow will you decide the best attribute\nfor now just understand\nthat you need to calculate something known as\ninformation game the attribute\nwith the highest Information Gain is considered the best.\nYeah.\nI know your next question might be like what?\nThis information,\nbut before we move on and see\nwhat exactly Information Gain Is let me first introduce you\nto a term called entropy\nbecause this term\nwill be used in calculating the Information Gain.\nWell entropy is just a metric\nwhich measures the impurity of something or in other words.\nYou can say that as the first step to do\nbefore you solve the problem of a decision tree\nas I mentioned is something about impurity.\nSo let's move on and understand what is impurity suppose.\nYou are a basket full of apples\nand another Bowl Which is full of same label,\nwhich says Apple now\nif you are asked to pick one item\nfrom each basket and ball,\nthen the probability of getting the apple\nand it's correct label is 1 so in this case, you can say\nthat impurities zero.\nAll right.\nNow what if there are four different fruits\nin the basket and four different labels in the ball,\nthen the probability of matching the fruit\nto a label is obviously not one.\nIt's something less than that.\nWell, it could be possible\nthat I picked banana from the basket\nand when I randomly picked Level from the ball.\nIt says a cherry any random permutation\nand combination can be possible.\nSo in this case, I'd say that impurities is nonzero.\nI hope the concept of impurities here.\nSo coming back to entropy\nas I said entropy is the measure of impurity\nfrom the graph on your left.\nYou can see that\nas the probability is zero or one\nthat is either they are highly impure\nor they are highly pure than in that case the value\nof entropy is zero.\nAnd when the probability is 0.5 then the value of entropy.\nIs maximum.\nWell, what is impurity impurities the degree\nof Randomness how random data is\nso if the data is\ncompletely pure in that case the randomness equals zero or\nif the data is completely empty or even in that case\nthe value of impurity will be zero question.\nLike why is it\nthat the value of entropy is maximum\nat 0.5 might arise in a mine, right?\nSo let me discuss about that.\nLet me derive it mathematically\nas you can see here on the slide the mathematical formula\nof entropy is -\nof probability of yes,\nlet's move on and see\nwhat this graph has to say mathematically suppose s is\nour total sample space and it's divided into two parts.\nYes, and no like in our data set the result\nfor playing was divided into two parts.\nYes or no,\nwhich we have to predict either we have to play or not.\nRight?\nSo for that particular case,\nyou can Define the formula of entropy as entropy\nof total sample space equals negative\nof probability of e\nis multiplied by log of probability.\nWe of yes,\nwhether base 2 minus probability of no X log of probability of no\nwith base to where s is your total sample space\nand P of v s is the probability of e s--\nand p-- of know is the probability of no.\nWell, if the number of BS equal number of know\nthat is probability of s equals 0.5 right\nsince you have equal number of BS and know so\nin that case the value\nof entropy will be one just put the value over there.\nAll right.\nLet me just move to Next slide I'll show you this.\nAlright next is if it contains all Yes,\nor all know that is probability of a sample space is either 1\nor 0 then in that case entropy will be equal to 0\nLet's see the mathematically one by one.\nSo let's start with the first condition\nwhere the probability was 0.5.\nSo this is our formula for entropy, right?\nSo there's our first case right which will discuss the art\nwhen the probability of vs equal probability of node\nthat is in our data set we have Rule number of yes, and no.\nAll right.\nSo probability of yes equal probability of no\nand that equals 0.5 or in other words,\nyou can say that yes\nplus no equal to Total sample space.\nAll right, since the probability is 0.5.\nSo when you put the values\nin the formula you get something like this\nand when you calculate it,\nyou will get the entropy of the total sample space as one.\nAll right.\nLet's see for the next case.\nWhat is the next case either you have totally us\nor you have to No,\nso if you have total, yes,\nlet's see the formula when we have total.\nYes.\nSo you have all yes and 0 no fine.\nSo probability of e s equal one.\nAnd yes as the total sample space obviously.\nSo in the formula when you put that thing up here,\nyou get entropy\nof sample space equal negative X of 1 multiplied by log of 1\nas the value of log 1 equals 0.\nSo the total thing will result to 0 similarly is the case\nwith no even in that case you will get the entropy\nof total sample.\nCase as 0 so this was all about entropy.\nAll right.\nNext is what is Information Gain?\nWell Information Gain\nwhat it does is it measures the reduction in entropy.\nIt decides which attribute\nshould be selected as the decision node.\nIf s is our total collection\nthan Information Gain equals entropy,\nwhich we calculated just now that -\nweighted average multiplied by entropy of each feature.\nDon't worry.\nWe'll just see\nhow it to calculate it with an example.\nAll right.\nSo let's manually build a decision tree\nfor our data set.\nSo there's our data set\nwhich consists of 14 different instances\nout of which we have nine.\nYes and five know I like so we have the formula\nfor entropy just put over that since 9 years.\nSo total probability of e s equals 9\nby 14 and total probability of no equals Phi by 14\nand when you put up the value\nand calculate the result you will get the value.\nOh of entropy as 0.94.\nAll right.\nSo this was your first step\nthat is compute the entropy for the entire data set.\nAll right.\nNow you have to select\nthat out of Outlook temperature humidity and windy,\nwhich of the node should you select as the root node\nbig question, right?\nHow will you decide that?\nThis particular node should be chosen at the base note\nand on the basis of\nthat only I will be creating the entire tree.\nI will select that.\nLet's see so you have to do\nit one by one you have to calculate the entropy\nand Information Gain for all\nof the Front note so starting with Outlook.\nSo Outlook has\nthree different parameters Sunny overcast and rainy.\nSo first of all select how many number of years\nand no are there in the case of Sunny like when it is sunny\nhow many number of years\nand how many number of nodes are there?\nSo in total we have to yes\nand three Nos and case of sunny in case of overcast.\nWe have all yes.\nSo if it is overcast then will surely go to play.\nIt's like that.\nAlright and next it is rainy then total number of vs equal.\nThree and total number of no equals 2 fine next\nwhat we do we calculate the entropy\nfor each feature for here.\nWe are calculating the entropy when Outlook equals Sunny.\nFirst of all,\nwe are assuming that Outlook is our root node\nand for that we are calculating the information gain for it.\nAlright.\nSo in order to calculate the Information Gain remember\nthe formula it was entropy of the total sample space -\nweighted average X entropy of each feature.\nAll right.\nSo what we are doing here,\nwe are calculating the entropy of out.\nLook when it was sunny.\nSo total number of yes,\nwhen it was sunny was to and total number of know\nthat was three fine.\nSo let's put up in the formula\nsince the probability of yes is 2 by 5\nand the probability of no is 3 by 5.\nSo you will get something like this.\nAlright, so you are getting the entropy\nof sunny as zero point nine seven one fine.\nNext we will calculate the entropy for overcast\nwhen it was overcast.\nRemember it was all yes, right.\nSo the probability\nof yes is equal 1 and when you put over\nthat you will get the value of entropy as 0 fine\nand when it was rainy rainy has 3s and to nose.\nSo probability of e s in case of Sonny's 3 by 5\nand probability of know in case of Sonny's 2 by 5.\nAnd when you add the value of probability of vs\nand probability of no to the formula,\nyou get the entropy of sunny as zero point nine seven one point.\nNow, you have to calculate\nhow much information you are getting from Outlook\nthat equals weighted average.\nAll right.\nSo what was this?\nTo diverge total number of years and total number of no fine.\nSo information from Outlook equals 5 by 14 from\nwhere does this 5 came over?\nWe are calculating\nthe total number of sample space within that particular Outlook\nwhen it was sunny, right?\nSo in case of Sunny there was two years and three NOS.\nAll right.\nSo weighted average for Sonny would be equal to 5 by 14.\nAll right,\nsince the formula was five by 14 x entropy of each feature.\nAll right, so\nas calculated the entropy He for Sonny is zero point nine.\nSeven one, right?\nSo what we'll do we'll multiply 5 by 14 with 0.97 one.\nRight?\nWell, this was the calculation for information\nwhen Outlook equal sunny,\nbut Outlook even equals overcast and rainy for in that case.\nWhat we'll do again similarly will calculate for everything\nfor overcast and sunny\nfor overcast weighted averages\nfor by 14 multiplied by its entropy.\nThat is 0 and for Sonny it is same Phi by 14.\nYes, and to Knows X its entropy\nthat is zero point nine seven one.\nAnd finally we'll take the sum of all of them which equals\nto 0.693 right next.\nWe will calculate the information gained this\nwhat we did earlier was information taken from Outlook.\nNow, we are calculating.\nWhat is the information?\nWe are gaining from Outlook right.\nNow this Information Gain\nthat equals to Total entropy minus the information\nthat is taken from Outlook.\nAll right, so So total entropy we had 0.94 -\ninformation we took from Outlook as 0.693.\nSo the value of information gained from Outlook results\nto zero point two four seven.\nAll right.\nSo next what we have to do.\nLet's assume that Wendy is our root node.\nSo Wendy consists of two parameters false and true.\nLet's see how many years\nand how many nodes are there in case of true and false.\nSo when Wendy has Falls as its parameter,\nthen in that case it has six years and to knows.\nAnd when it as true as its parameter,\nit has 3 S and 3 nodes.\nAll right.\nSo let's move ahead\nand similarly calculate the information taken from Wendy\nand finally calculate the information gained from Wendy.\nAlright, so first of all,\nwhat we'll do we'll calculate the entropy\nof each feature starting with windy equal true.\nSo in case of true we had equal number of yes\nand equal number of no will remember the graph\nwhen we had the probability as\n0.5 as total number of years equal total number of know.\nFor that case the entropy equals 1\nso we can directly write entropy of room\nwhen it's windy is one\nas we had already proved it\nwhen probability equals 0.5 the entropy is the maximum\nthat equals to 1.\nAll right.\nNext is entropy of false when it is windy.\nAll right, so similarly just put the probability of yes\nand no in the formula and then calculate the result\nsince you have six years and two nodes.\nSo in total,\nyou'll get the probability of e S6 by 8 and probability\nof know Two by eight.\nAll right, so when you will calculate it,\nyou will get the entropy\nof false as zero point eight one one.\nAlright, now, let's calculate the information from windy.\nSo total information collected from Windy\nequals information taken\nwhen Wendy equal true plus information taken\nwhen when D equals false.\nSo we'll calculate the weighted average for each one of them\nand then we'll sum\nit up to finally get the total information taken from windy.\nSo in this case,\nit equals to 8 by 14 multiplied by 0.8 1 1 + 6 y 14 x 1\nwhat is this?\n8 it is total number of yes, and\nno in case when when D equals false, right?\nSo when it was false, so total number of BS\nthat equals to 6 and total more of know that equal to 2\nthat some herbs to 8.\nAll right.\nSo that is why the weighted average results to Aid by\n14 similarly information taken\nwhen windy equals true equals to 3 plus 3 that is 3 S\nand 3 no equal 6 divided by total number of sample space.\nThat is 14 x That is entropy of true.\nAll right, so it is a\nby 14 multiplied by 0.8 1 1 plus 6 by 14 x one\nwhich results to 0.89 to this\nis information taken from Windy.\nAll right.\nNow how much information you are gaining from Wendy.\nSo for that what you will do so total information gained\nfrom Windy that equals to Total entropy -\ninformation taken from Windy.\nAll right, that is 0.94 -\n0.89 to that equals to zero point zero four eight.\nAnd so 0.048 is the information gained from Windy.\nAll right.\nSimilarly we calculated for the rest to all right.\nSo for Outlook as you can see,\nthe information was 0.693.\nAnd it's Information Gain was zero point two four seven\nin case of temperature.\nThe information was around\nzero point nine one one and the Information Gain\nthat was equal to 0.02 9 in case of humidity.\nThe information gained was 0.15 to and in the case of windy.\nThe information gained was 0.048.\nSo what we'll do we'll select the attribute.\nWith a maximum fine.\nNow, we are selected Outlook as our root node,\nand it is further subdivided\ninto three different parts Sunny overcast and rain,\nso in case of overcast we have seen\nthat it consists of all.\nYes, so we can consider it as a leaf node,\nbut in case of sunny and rainy,\nit's doubtful as it consists of both.\nYes and both know\nso you need to recalculate the things right again\nfor this node.\nYou have to recalculate the things.\nAll right, you have to again select the attribute.\nIs having the maximum Information Gain.\nAll right, so there's\nhow your complete tree will look like.\nAll right.\nSo, let's see when you can play so you can play\nwhen Outlook is overcast.\nAll right, in that case.\nYou can always play if the Outlook is sunny.\nYou will further drill down to check the humidity condition.\nAll right, if the humidity is normal,\nthen you will play\nif the humidity is high then you won't play right\nwhen the Outlook predicts\nthat it's rainy then further you will check\nwhether it's windy or not.\nIf it is a week went then you will go and offer.\nSay but if it has strong wind, then you won't play right?\nSo this is how your entire decision tree would look\nlike at the end.\nNow comes the concept of pruning say is\nthat what should I do to play?\nWell you have to do pruning pruning will decide\nhow you will play.\nWhat is this pruning?\nWell, this pruning is nothing but cutting down the nodes\nand order to get the optimal solution.\nAll right.\nSo what pruning does it reduces the complexity?\nAll right as are you can see on the screen\nthat it showing only the result for you.\nThat is it showing all the result which says\nthat you can play.\nAll right before we drill down to a practical session\na common question might come in your mind.\nYou might think\nthat our tree base model better than cleaner model, right?\nYou can think like if I can use a logistic regression\nfor classification problem\nand linear regression for regression problem.\nThen why there is a need to use the tree.\nWell many of us have this In in their mind and well,\nthere's a valid question too.\nWell, actually as I said earlier,\nyou can use any algorithm.\nIt depends on the type of problem.\nYou're solving let's look at some key factor,\nwhich will help you to decide which algorithm to use and\nwhen so the first point being\nif the relationship between dependent and independent\nvariable as well approximated\nby a linear model then linear\nregression will outperform tree base model second case\nif there is a high non-linearity and complex\nrelationship between Lent\nand independent variables at remodel will outperform\na classical regression model in third case.\nIf you need to build a model\nwhich is easy to explain to people a decision tree model\nwill always do better than a linear model\nas the decision tree models\nare simpler to interpret then linear regression.\nAll right.\nNow, let's move on ahead and see\nhow you can write it as Gentry classifier from scratch\nand python using the card algorithm.\nAll right for this.\nI will be using jupyter notebook with python 3.0.\nOh install on it.\nAlright, so let's open the Anaconda\nand the jupyter notebook.\nWhereas that so this\nis a inner Corner Navigator and I will directly jump over\nto jupyter notebook and hit the launch button.\nI guess everyone knows that jupyter.\nNotebook is a web-based interactive Computing notebook\nenvironment where you can run your python codes.\nSo my jupyter notebook.\nIt opens on my Local Host double 8 9 1\nso I will be using this jupyter notebook\nin order to write my decision tree classifier\nusing python for this decision tree classifier.\nI have already written.\nSet of codes.\nLet me explain you just one by one.\nSo we'll start with initializing our training data set.\nSo there's our sample data set\nfor which each row is an example.\nThe last column is a label\nand the first two columns are the features.\nIf you want you can add some more features an example\nfor your practice interesting fact is\nthat this data set is designed in a way\nthat the second and fifth example have almost\nthe same features,\nbut they have different labels.\nAll right.\nSo let's move on and see how the tree handles this case\nas you can see here both.\nBoth of them the second\nand the fifth column have the same features.\nWhat did different is just their label?\nRight?\nSo let's move ahead.\nSo this is our training data set next what we are doing we\nare adding some column labels.\nSo they are used only to print the trees fine.\nSo what we'll do we'll add header to the columns\nlike the First Column is of color second is of diameter\nand third is a label column.\nAlright, next Road will do will Define\na function as unique values in which will pass the rows\nand the columns.\nSo this function what it will do.\nWe find the unique values for a column in the data set.\nSo this is an example for that.\nSo what we are doing here,\nwe are passing training data Hazard row\nand column number as 0 so\nwhat we are doing we are finding unique values in terms of color.\nAnd in this\nsince the row is training data and the column is 1\nso what you are doing here,\nso we are finding the unique values\nin terms of diameter fine.\nSo this is just an example next\nwhat we'll do we'll Define a function as class count\nand we'll pass zeros into it.\nSo what it does it counts the number of each type\nof Example within data set.\nSo in this function\nwhat we are basically doing we are counting the number\nof each type for example\nin the data set or what we are doing.\nWe are counting the unique values for the label\nin the data set as a sample.\nYou can see here.\nWe can pass that entire training data set\nto this particular function as class underscore count\nwhat it will do it will find all the different types of label\nwithin the training data set\nas you can see here the unique label consists of mango grape\nand lemon so next what we'll do we'll Define a function\nis numeric and we'll pass a value into it.\nSo what it Do it.\nWe'll just test\nif the value is numeric or not and it will return\nif the value is an integer or a float.\nFor example, you can see is numeric.\nWe are passing 7 so it is an integer\nso it will return in value and\nif we are passing red it's not a numeric value, right?\nSo moving on ahead\nwhere you define a class named as question.\nSo what this question does\nthis question is used to partition the data set.\nThis class voted does it just records a column number?\nFor example 0 for color a light and a column value for example,\ngreen Next what we are doing we are defining a match method\nwhich is used to compare the feature value\nin the example.\nThe feature values stored in the question.\nLet's see how first of all what you are doing.\nWe're defining an init function and inside\nthat we are passing the self column\nand the value as parameter.\nSo next what we do we Define a function\nas match what it does is it compares the feature value\nin an example to the feature value in this question\nwhen next we'll Define a function as re PR,\nwhich is just a helper method to print the question\nin a readable format.\nNext what we are doing we are defining a function partition.\nWell, this function is used to partition\nthe data set each row in the data set it checks\nif it matched the question or not\nif it does so it adds it to the true rose or if not,\nthen it adds to the false Rose.\nAll right, for example,\nas you can see, it's partition the training data set based on\nwhether the rows are ready or not here.\nWe are calling the function question\nand we are passing a value of zero and read to it.\nSo what did we do?\nIt will assign all the red rose to True underscore Rose.\nAnd everything else will be assigned\nto false underscore rose fine.\nNext what we'll do we'll Define a gini impurity function\nand inside that will pass the list of rows.\nSo what it will do it will just calculate the dream Purity\nfor the list of rows.\nNext what we are doing every defining a function\nas Information Gain.\nSo what this Information Gain function does it calculates\nThe Information Gain using the uncertainty\nof the starting node -\nthe weighted impurity of the child node.\nThe next function is find the best plate.\nWell, this function is used to find the best question to ask\nby iterating over every feature of value\nand then calculating the information game.\nFor the detail explanation on the code.\nYou can find the code in the description given below.\nAll right next we'll define a class as leave\nfor classifying the data.\nIt holds a dictionary of glass like mango for how many times\nit appears in the row from the training data\nthat reaches the sleeve.\nAlright next is the decision node.\nSo this decision node, it will ask a question.\nThis holds a reference to the question\nand the two child nodes on the base of\nthat you are deciding which node to add further to which branch.\nAlright so next video.\nWe're defining a function of Beltre and inside\nthat we are passing our number of rows.\nSo this is the function that is used to build the tree.\nSo initially what we did we Define all the various function\nthat we'll be using in order to build a tree.\nSo let's start\nby partitioning the data set for each unique attribute,\nthen we'll calculate the information gain\nand then return the question\nthat produces the highest gain\nand on the basis of that will split the tree.\nSo what we are doing here,\nwe are partitioning the data set calculating\nthe Information Gain.\nAnd then what this is returning it is returning the question\nthat is producing the highest gain.\nAll right.\nNow if gain equals 0 return Leaf Rose,\nso what it will do.\nSo if we are getting no for the gain\nthat is gain equals 0 then in that case\nsince no further question could be asked\nso what it will do it will return a leaf fine now true\nor underscore Rose\nor false underscore Rose equal partition with rose\nand the question.\nSo if we are reaching tell this position,\nthen you have already found a Value\nwhich will be used to partition the data set then\nwhat you will do you will recursively build\nthe true branch\nand similarly recursively build the false Branch.\nSo return Division and Discord node and side\nthat will be passing question true branch and false Branch.\nSo what it will do it will return a question node.\nThis question node this recalls the best feature\nor the value to ask at this point fine.\nNow that we have Builder tree next\nwhat we'll do we'll Define a print underscore tree function\nwhich will be used to print the tree fine.\nSo finally what we are doing in this particular function\nthat we are printing our tree next is the classify function\nwhich will use it to decide\nwhether to follow the true Branch or the false branch\nand then compared\nto the feature values stored in the node to the example.\nWe are considering and last what we'll do\nwe'll finally print the production at the leaf.\nSo let's execute it and see okay,\nso there's our testing data.\nOnline so we printed a leaf as well.\nNow that we have trained our algorithm is\nour training data set now it's time to test it.\nSo there's our testing data set.\nSo let's finally execute it and see what is the result.\nSo this is the result you will get so first question,\nwhich is asked by the algorithm is is diameter greater\nthan equal to 3,\nif it is true,\nthen it will further ask if the color is yellow again,\nif it is true,\nthen it will predict mango as one and lemon with one.\nAnd in case it is false,\nthen it will just predict the mango.\nNow.\nThis was the true part.\nNow next coming to diameter is not greater\nthan or equal to 3 then in that case it's false.\nAnd what did we do?\nIt'll just predict the grape vine.\nOkay.\nSo this was all about the coding part now,\nlet's conclude this session.\nBut before concluding let me just show you one more thing.\nNow.\nThere's a scikit-learn algorithm cheat sheet,\nwhich explains you\nwhich algorithm you should use and when all right,\nlet's build in a decision tree format.\nAt let's see how it is Big.\nSo first condition it will check\nwhether you have 50 samples or not.\nIf your samples are greater than 50,\nthen we'll move ahead if it is less than 50,\nthen you need to collect more data\nif your sample is greater than 50,\nthen you have to decide\nwhether you want to predict a category or not.\nIf you want to predict a category,\nthen further you will see\nthat whether you have labeled data or not.\nIf you have label data, then\nthat would be a classification algorithm problem.\nIf you don't have the label data,\nthen it would be a clustering problem.\nNow if you don't want to The category then\nwhat you want to protect predict a quantity.\nWell, if you want to predict a quantity,\nthen in that case,\nit would be a regression problem.\nIf you don't want to predict\na quantity and you want to keep looking further,\nthen in that case,\nyou should go for dimensionality reduction problems and still\nif you don't want to look\nand the predicting structure is not working.\nThen you have tough luck for that.\nI hope this doesn't recession clarifies all your doubt\nover decision tree algorithm.\nNow, we'll try to find out the answer to this particular\nquestion as to why we need random Forest fine.\nSo like human beings learn from the past experiences.\nSo unlike human beings a computer does not have\nexperiences then how does machine takes decisions?\nWhere does it learn from?\nWell a computer system actually\nlearns from the data which represents some past experiences\nof an application domain.\nSo now let's see,\nhow random Forest It's in building up in learning model\nwith a very simple use case of credit risk detection.\nNow needless to say\nthat credit card companies\nhave a very nested interest in identifying\nFinancial transactions\nthat are illegitimate and criminal in nature.\nAnd also I would like to mention this point\nthat according to the Federal Reserve payments\nstudy Americans used credit cards to pay\nfor twenty six point two million purchases in 2012\nand The estimated loss due to unauthorized transactions\nthat here was u.s.\n6 point 1 billion dollars now\nin the banking industry measuring risk is very critical\nbecause the stakes are too high.\nSo the overall goal is actually to figure out\nwho all can be fraudulent\nbefore too much Financial damage has been done.\nSo for this a credit card company receives thousands\nof applications for new cards\nand each application contains information.\nMission about an applicant, right?\nSo so here as you can see that from all those applications\nwhat we can actually figure out is\nthat predictor variables.\nLike what is the marital status of the person?\nWhat is the gender of the person?\nWhat is the age of the person and the status which is actually\nwhether it is a default pair or non-default pair.\nSo default payments are basically when payments\nare not made in time\nand according to the agreement signed by the cardholder.\nSo now that account is actually set to be in the default.\nSo you can easily figure out the history\nof the particular card holder from this then we can also look\nat the time of payment\nwhether he has been a regular pair\nor non regular one.\nWhat is the source of income for that particular person\nand so and so forth.\nSo to minimize loss the back actually needs\ncertain decision rule to predict\nwhether to approve\nParticular no one of that particular person or not.\nNow here is\nwhere the random Forest actually comes into the picture.\nAll right.\nNow, let's see how random Forest can actually help us\nin this particular scenario.\nNow, we have taken randomly\ntwo parameters out of all the predictive variables\nthat we saw previously now,\nwe have taken two predictor variables here.\nThe first one is the income\nand the second one is the H right\nand Hurley parallel\nit to decision trees have been implemented\nupon those predicted variables and let's first assume the case\nof the income variable right?\nSo here we have divided our income into three categories\nthe first one being the person earning over $35,000 second\nfrom 15 to 35 thousand dollars the third one running\nin the range of 0 to 15 thousand dollars.\nNow if a person is earning over $35,000,\nwhich is a pretty Good income pretty decent.\nSo now we'll check out for the credit history.\nAnd here the probability is\nthat if a person is earning a good amount then\nthere is very low risk\nthat he won't be able to pay back already earning good.\nSo the probability is\nthat his application of loan will get approved.\nRight?\nSo there is actually low risk or moderate risk,\nbut there's no real issue of higher risk as such.\nWe can approve the applicants request here.\nNow, let's move on and watch out for the second category\nwhere the person is actually earning\nfrom 15 to 35 thousand dollars right now here the person may\nor may not pay back.\nSo in such scenarios will look for the credit history as\nto what has been his previous history.\nNow if his previous history has been bad\nlike he has been a default ER in the previous transactions\nwill definitely not Consider approving his request\nand he will be\nat the high risk in which is not good for the bank.\nIf the previous history\nof that particular applicant is really good.\nThen we will just to clarify\na doubt will consider another parameter as well\nthat will be on depth.\nI have his already in really high dip then\nthe risks again increases and there are chances\nthat he might not pay repay in the future.\nSo here Will.\nNot accept the request of the person having high dipped\nif the person is in the low depth\nand he has been a good pair in his past history.\nThen there are chances\nthat he might be back and we can consider\napproving the request of this particular applicant.\nAlex look at the third category,\nwhich is a person earning from 0 to 15 thousand dollars.\nNow, this is something which actually raises I broke\nand this person will actually lie\nin the category of high risk.\nAll right.\nSo the probability is\nthat his application of loan would probably get rejected now,\nwe'll get one final outcome from this income parameter, right?\nNow let us look at our second variable\nthat is H which will lead into the second decision tree.\nNow.\nLet us say if the person is Young, right?\nSo now we will look forward to if it is a student now\nif it is a student then the chances are high\nthat he won't be able to repay back\nbecause he has no earning Source, right?\nSo here the risks are too high and probability is\nthat his application of loan will get rejected fine.\nNow if the person is Young\nand his Not the student then we'll probably go on\nand look for another variable.\nThat is pan balance.\nNow.\nLet's look if the bank balance is less than 5 lakhs.\nSo again the risk arises and the probabilities\nthat his application of loan will get rejected.\nNow if the person is Young is not a student\nand his bank balance so\nof greater than 5 lakhs is got a pretty good\nand stable and balanced then the probability is\nthat he is sort of application\nwill get approved of Now let us take another scenario\nif he's a senior, right?\nSo if he is a senior will probably go and check out\nfor this credit history.\nHow well has he been in his previous transactions?\nWhat kind of a person he is like\nwhether he's a defaulter or is Ananda falter.\nNow if he is a very fair kind of person\nin his previous transactions then again the risk arises\nand the probability of his application\ngetting rejected actually increases right now\nif he has An excellent person as\nper his transactions in the previous history.\nSo now again here there is least risk\nand the probabilities\nthat his application of loan will get approved.\nSo now here these two variables income and age have led\nto two different decision trees.\nRight and these two different decision trees actually led\nto two different results.\nNow what random forest does is it will actually compile\nthese two different results from these two different.\nGentry's and then finally,\nit will lead to a final outcome.\nThat is how random Forest actually works.\nRight?\nSo that is actually the motive of the random Forest.\nNow let us move forward and see what is random Forest right?\nYou can get an idea\nof the mechanism from the name itself random forests.\nSo a collection of trees is a fortress\nthat's why I called for is probably and here\nalso the trees are actually because being trained on subsets\nwhich are being selected at random.\nAnd therefore they are called random forests So Random forests\nis a collection or an insane.\nHumble of decision trees right here decision trees actually\nbuilt using the whole data set considering all features,\nbut actually in random Forest only a fraction of the number\nof rows is selected\nand that too at random\nand a particular number of features,\nwhich are actually selected at random are trained\nupon and that is\nhow the decision trees are built upon.\nRight?\nSo similarly number of decision trees will be grown\nand each decision tree will Salt into a certain final outcome\nand random Forest will do nothing\nbut actually just compiled the results\nof all those decision trees to bring up the final result.\nAs you can see in this particular figure\nthat a particular instance actually has resulted\ninto three different decision trees, right?\nSo not tree one results into a final outcome called Class A\nand tree to results\ninto class B. Similarly tree three results into class P\nSo Random Forest\nwill compile the results of all these Decision trees\nand it will go by the call of the majority voting now\nsince head to decision trees have actually voted\ninto the favor of the Class B that is decision tree 2 and 3.\nTherefore the final outcome will be in the favor of the Class B.\nAnd that is how random Forest actually works upon.\nNow one really\nbeautiful thing about this particular algorithm is\nthat it is one of the versatile algorithms\nwhich is capable of Performing both regression as well as Now,\nlet's try to understand random Forest further\nwith a very beautiful example or this is my favorite one.\nSo let's say you want to decide\nif you want to watch edge of tomorrow or not, right?\nSo in this particular scenario,\nyou will have two different actions to work Bond either.\nYou can just straight away go\nto your best friend asked him about.\nAll right,\nwhether should I go for Edge of Tomorrow not will I\nlike this movie or you can ask Your friends\nand take their opinion consideration and then based\non the final results\nwho can go out and watch Edge of Tomorrow, right?\nSo now let's just take the first scenario.\nSo where you go to your best friend asked about\nwhether you should go out to watch edge\nof tomorrow or not.\nSo your friend will probably ask you certain questions\nlike the first one being here Jonah So so let's say\nyour friend asks you\nif you really like The Adventurous kind\nof movies or not.\nSo you say yes,\ndefinitely I would love to watch it Venture kind of movie.\nSo the probabilities\nthat you will like edge of tomorrow as well.\nSince Age of Tomorrow is also a movie of Adventure\nand sci-fi kind of Journal right?\nSo let's say you do not like the adventure John a movie.\nSo then again the probability reduces\nthat you might really not like edge of Morrow right.\nSo from here you can come to a certain conclusion right?\nLet's say your best friend puts you into another situation\nwhere he'll ask you\nor a do you like Emily Blunt and you see definitely\nI like Emily Blunt and then he puts another question to you.\nDo you like Emily Blunt to be in the main lead\nand you say yes, then again,\nthe probability arises\nthat you will definitely like edge of tomorrow as\nwell because Edge of Tomorrow is Has the Emily plant\nin the main lead cast so\nand if you say oh I do not like Emily Blunt then again,\nthe probability reduces\nthat you would like Edge of Tomorrow to write.\nSo this is one way\nwhere you have one decision tree and your final outcome.\nYour final decision will be based on your one decision tree,\nor you can see your final outcome will be based\non just one friend.\nNo, definitely not really convinced.\nYou want to consider the options of your other friends also\nso that you can make very precise and crisp\ndecision right you go out\nand you approach some other bunch of friends of yours.\nSo now let's say you go to three of your friends\nand you ask them the same question\nwhether I would like to watch it off tomorrow or not.\nSo you go out and approach\nthree or four friends friend one friend twin friend three.\nNow, you will consider each of their Sport\nand then you will your decision now will be dependent\non the compiled results of all of your three friends, right?\nNow here, let's say you go to your first friend\nand you ask him\nwhether you would like to watch it just tomorrow\nnot and your first friend puts you to one question.\nDid you like Top Gun?\nAnd you say yes,\ndefinitely I did like the movie Top Gun then the probabilities\nthat you would like edge of tomorrow as\nwell because topgun is actually a military action drama,\nwhich is also Tom Cruise.\nSo now again the probability Rises that yes,\nyou will like edge of tomorrow as well and\nIf you say no I didn't like Top Gun then again.\nThe chances are\nthat you wouldn't like Edge of Tomorrow, right?\nAnd then another question that he puts you across is\nthat do you really like to watch action movies?\nAnd you say yes,\nI would love to watch them that again.\nThe chances are\nthat you would like to watch Edge of Tomorrow.\nSo from your friend\nwhen you can come to one conclusion now\nhere since the ratio\nof liking the movie to don't like is actually 2 is\nto 1 so the final result is Actually,\nyou would like Edge of Tomorrow.\nNow you go to your second friend and you ask the same question.\nSo now you are second friend asks you did you like far\nand away when we went out and did the last time\nwhen we washed it\nand you say no I really didn't like far and away\nthen you would say then you are definitely going\nto like Edge of Tomorrow.\nWhy does so because far and away is actually\nsince most of whom might not be knowing it so far\nin a ways Johner of romance\nand it revolves around a girl\nand a guy By falling in love with each other and so on.\nSo the probability is\nthat you wouldn't like edge of tomorrow.\nSo he ask you another question.\nDid you like Bolivian\nand to really like to watch Tom Cruise?\nAnd you say Yes, again.\nThe probability is\nthat you would like to watch Edge of Tomorrow.\nWhy because Oblivion again is a science fiction\ncasting Tom Cruise full of strange experiences.\nAnd where Tom Cruise is the savior of the masses.\nKind well,\nthat is the same kind of plot in edge of tomorrow as well.\nSo here it is pure yes\nthat you would like to watch edge of tomorrow.\nSo you get\nanother second decision from your second friend.\nNow you go to your third friend and ask him so\nprobably our third friend is not really interesting\nin having any sort of conversation with you say,\nit just simply asks you did you like Godzilla and you said\nno I didn't like Godzilla's\nwe said definitely you wouldn't like\nit's of tomorrow why so\nbecause Godzilla is also actually sign Fiction movie\nfrom the adventure Jonah.\nSo now you have got three results from\nthree different decision trees from three different friends.\nNow you compile the results of all those friends\nand then you make a final call that yes,\nwould you like to watch edge of tomorrow or not?\nSo this is some very real time and very interesting example\nwhere you can actually Implement random Forest\ninto ground reality right any questions so far.\nSo far, no,\nthat's good, and then we can move forward.\nNow let us look at various domains\nwhere random Forest is actually used.\nSo because of its diversity random Forest is actually used\nin various diverse to means\nlike so beat banking beat\nmedicine beat land use beat marketing name it\nand random Forest is there so in banking particularly\nrandom Forest is being actually used to make it out\nwhether the applicant will be a default a pair\nor it Will be non default of 1\nso that it can accordingly\napprove or reject the applications of loan,\nright?\nSo that is how random Forest is being used in banking\ntalking about medicine.\nRandom.\nForest is widely used\nin medicine field to predict beforehand.\nWhat is the probability\nif a person will actually have a particular disease or not?\nRight?\nSo it's actually used to look at the various disease Trends.\nLet's say you want to figure out what is the probability\nthat a person will have diabetes?\nNot and so what would you do?\nIt'd probably look at the medical history\nof the patient and then you will see or read.\nThis has been the glucose concentration.\nWhat was the BMI?\nWhat was the insulin levels\nin the patient in the past previous three months.\nWhat is the age of this particular person\nand will make a different decision trees based on each one\nof these predictor variables\nand then you'll finally compiled the results\nof all those variables and then you'll make a fine.\nFinal decision as\nto whether the person will have diabetes\nin the near future or not.\nThat is how random Forest will be used\nin medicine sector now move.\nRandom Forest is also actually used to find out the land use.\nFor example, I want to set up a particular industry\nin certain area.\nSo what would I probably look for a look for?\nWhat is the vegetation over there?\nWhat is the Urban population over there?\nRight and how much is the Is from the nearest modes\nof Transport like from the bus station\nor the railway station and accordingly.\nI will split my parameters\nand I will make decision on each one of these parameters\nand finally I'll compile my decision of all\nthese parameters in that will be my final outcome.\nSo that is how I am finally going to predict\nwhether I should put my industry\nat this particular location or not.\nRight?\nSo these three examples have actually been of majorly\naround classification problem\nbecause we are trying to classify\nwhether or not we're actually trying to answer this question\nwhether or not right now,\nlet's move forward and look\nhow marketing is revolving around random Forest.\nSo particularly in marketing\nwe try to identify the customer churn.\nSo this is particularly the regression kind\nof problem right now\nhow let's see so customer churn\nis nothing but actually the number of people\nwhich are actually The number of customers\nwho are losing out.\nSo we're going out of your market.\nNow you want to identify\nwhat will be your customer churn in near future.\nSo you'll most of them\neCommerce Industries are actually using this\nlike Amazon Flipkart Etc.\nSo they particularly look at your each Behavior as to\nwhat has been your past history.\nWhat has been your purchasing history.\nWhat do you like based on your activity\naround certain things around certain ads around certain?\nDiscounts or around certain kind of materials right?\nIf you like a particular top your activity will be more\naround that particular top.\nSo that is how they track each and every particular move\nof yours and then they try to predict\nwhether you will be moving out or not.\nSo that is how they identify the customer churn.\nSo these all are various domains\nwhere random Forest is used and this is\nnot the only list so there are numerous other examples\nwhich are Chile are using\nrandom forests that makes it so special actually.\nNow, let's move forward and see how random\nForest actually works.\nRight.\nSo let us start with the random Forest algorithm first.\nLet's just see it step\nby step as to how random Forest algorithm works.\nSo the first step is to actually select\ncertain M features from T.\nWhere m is less than T.\nSo here T is the total number of the predictor variables\nthat you have\nin your data set and out of those total predictor variables.\nYou will select some randomly some Features out of those now\nwhy we are actually selecting a few features only.\nThe reason is\nthat if you will select all the predictive variables\nor the total predictor variables then each of your decision tree\nwill be same.\nSo the model is not actually learning something new.\nIt is learning the same previous thing\nbecause all those decision trees will be similar,\nright if you actually split your predicted variables\nand you select randomly a few predicted variables only.\nLet's say there are 14 total number of variables and out\nof those you randomly pick just three right?\nSo every time you will get a new decision tree,\nso there will be variety.\nRight?\nSo the classification model will be actually\nmuch more intelligent than the previous one.\nNow.\nIt has got barrier to experiences.\nSo definitely it will make different decisions each time.\nAnd then when you will compile all those different decisions,\nit will be a new more accurate.\nAn efficient result right?\nSo the first important step is to select certain number\nof features out of all the features now,\nlet's move on to the second step.\nLet's say for any node D. Now.\nThe first step is to calculate the best plate at that point.\nSo, you know that decision tree\nhow decision trees actually implemented so\nyou pick up a the most significant variable right?\nAnd then you will split that particular node\ninto Other child nodes\nthat is how the split takes place, right?\nSo you will do it for M number of variables\nthat you have selected.\nLet's say you have selected three\nso you will implement the split at all.\nThose three nodes in one particular decision tree,\nright the third step is split up the node\ninto two daughter nodes.\nSo now you can split your root note\ninto as many notes\nas you want to put hair will split our node\ninto 2.2 notes as to this\nor that so it will be an answer in terms of You saw that right?\nOur fourth step will be to repeat all these 3 steps\nthat we've done previously\nand we'll repeat all this splitting\nuntil we have reached all the N number of nodes.\nRight?\nSo we need to repeat\nuntil we have reached till the leaf nodes\nof a decision tree.\nThat is how we will do it right now after these four steps.\nWe will have our one decision tree.\nBut random Forest is actually about multiple.\nAsian trees.\nSo here our fifth step will come into the picture\nwhich will actually repeat all these previous steps\nfor D number of times now hit these the D number\nof decision trees.\nLet's say I want to implement five decision trees.\nSo my first step\nwill be to implement all the previous steps 5 times.\nSo the head the eye tration is 4/5 number of times right now.\nOnce I have created\nthese five decision trees still my task is not complete yet.\nOn my final task will be to compile the results\nof all these five different decision trees\nand I will make a call\nin the majority voting right here.\nAs you can see in this picture.\nI had in different instances.\nThen I created n different decision trees.\nAnd finally I will compile the result of all these n\ndifferent decision trees\nand I will take my call on the majority voting right.\nSo whatever my majority vote says\nthat will be My final result.\nSo this is basically an overview of the random Forest algorithm\nhow it actually works.\nLet's just have a look at this example to get\nmuch better understanding of what we have learnt.\nSo let's say I have this data set\nwhich consists of four different instances, right?\nSo basically it consists of the weather information\nof previous 14 days right from D1 tildy 14,\nand this basically Outlook humidity and wind\nis Click gives me the better condition\nof those 14 days.\nAnd finally I have play\nwhich is my target variable weather match did take place\non that particular day or not right.\nNow.\nMy main goal is to find out\nwhether the match will actually take place\nif I have following these weather conditions\nwith me on any particular day.\nLet's say the Outlook is rainy that day\nand humidity is high and the wind is very weak.\nSo now I need to predict\nwhether I will be able to play in the match.\nThat they are not.\nAll right.\nSo this is a problem statement fine.\nNow, let's see how random Forest is used in this to sort it out.\nNow here the first step is to actually split\nmy entire data set into subsets here.\nI have split my entire 14 variables into further\nsmaller subsets right now these subsets may\nor may not overlap\nlike there is certain overlapping between d 1 till D3\nand D3 till D6 fine.\nIs an overlapping of D3\nso it might happen that there might be overlapping\nso you need not really worry about the overlapping\nbut you have to make sure\nthat all those subsets are actually different right?\nSo here I have taken three different subsets\nmy first subset consists of D1\ntill D3 Mexican subset consists of D3\ntill D6 and methods subset consists of D7 tildy.\nNow now I will first be focusing on my first upset now here,\nlet's say that particular day\nthe Outlook was Overcast fine if yes,\nit was overcast then the probabilities\nthat the match will take place.\nSo overcast is basically when your weather is too cloudy.\nSo if that is the condition then definitely the match\nwill take place and let's say it wasn't overcast.\nThen you will consider these second most probable option\nthat will be the wind\nand you will make a decision based on this now\nwhether wind was weak or strong if wind was weak,\nthen you will definitely go out and play them.\nJudge as you would not so now the final outcome\nout of this decision tree will be Play\nBecause here the ratio between the play\nand no play is to is to 1\nso we get to a certain decision from a first decision tree.\nNow, let us look at the second subset now\nsince second subset has different number of variables.\nSo that is why this decision trees absolutely different from\nwhat we saw in our four subsets.\nSo let's say if it was overcast then you will play the match\nif It isn't the overcast in you would go\nand look out for humidity.\nNow further.\nIt will get split into two whether it was high or normal.\nNow, we'll take the first case\nif the humidity was high and when it was week,\nthen you will play the match else\nif humidity was high but wind was too strong,\nthen you would not go out and play the match right now.\nLet us look at the second dot to node of humidity\nif the humidity was normal.\nThe wind was weak.\nThen you will definitely go out and play the match\nas you want go out and play the match.\nSo here if you look at the final result,\nthen the ratio of placed no play is 3 is to 2 then again.\nThe final outcome is actually play, right?\nSo from second subset,\nwe get the final decision of play now,\nlet us look at our third subset\nwhich consists of D7 till D9 here\nif again the overcast is yes, then you will play a match.\nEach else you will go and check out for humidity.\nAnd if the humidity is really high then you\nwon't play the match else.\nYou will play the match again the probability\nof playing the matches.\nYes, because the ratio of no play is Twist one, right?\nSo three different subsets three different decision trees\nthree different outcomes\nand one final outcome after compiling all the results\nfrom these three different decision trees are so I This\ngives a better perspective better understanding\nof random Forest like how it really works.\nAll right.\nSo now let's just have a look\nat various features of random Forest Ray.\nSo the first and the foremost feature is\nthat it is one\nof the most accurate learning algorithms, right?\nSo why it is so\nbecause single decision trees are actually prone\nto having high variance\nor Hive bias and on the contrary actually.\nM4s, it averages the entire variance\nacross the decision trees.\nSo let's say\nif the variances say X4 decision tree,\nbut for random Forest,\nlet's say we have implemented n number\nof decision trees parallely.\nSo my entire variance gets averaged to upon\nand my final variance actually becomes X upon n so\nthat is how the entire variance actually goes down\nas compared to other algorithms.\nNow second most important feature is\nthat it works well for both classification\nand regression problems\nand by far I have come across this is one\nand the only algorithm\nwhich works equally well for both of them\nthese classification kind of problem or a regression kind\nof problem, right?\nThen it's really runs efficient on large databases.\nSo basically it's really scalable.\nEven if you work for the lesser amount of database\nor if you work for a really huge volume of data, right?\nSo that's a very good part about it.\nThen the fourth most important point is\nthat it requires almost no input preparation.\nNow, why am I saying this is\nbecause it has got certain implicit methods,\nwhich actually take care and All the outliers\nand all the missing data\nand you really don't have to take care about all that thing\nwhile you are in the stages of input preparations.\nSo Random Forest is all here to take care\nof everything else and next.\nIs it performs implicit feature selection, right?\nSo while we are implementing multiple decision trees,\nso it has got implicit method\nwhich will automatically pick up some random features out.\nOf all your parameters and then it will go\non and implementing different decision trees.\nSo for example,\nif you just give one simple command\nthat all right,\nI want to implement 500 decision trees no matter\nhow so Random Forest will automatically take care\nand it will Implement all those 500 decision trees\nand those all 500 decision trees will be different\nfrom each other and this is\nbecause it has got implicit methods\nwhich will automatically collect different parameters.\nOut of all the variables that you have right?\nThen it can be easily grown in parallel why it is so\nbecause we are actually\nimplementing multiple decision trees and all\nthose decision trees are running\nor all those decisions trees are actually\ngetting implemented parallely.\nSo if you say I want thousand trees to be implemented.\nSo all those thousand trees are getting implemented parallely.\nSo that is how the computation time reduces down.\nRight, and the last point is\nthat it has got methods for balancing error\nin unbalanced it\nas it's now what exactly unbalanced data sets\nare let me just give you an example of that.\nSo let's say you're working on a data set fine\nand you create a random forest model and get\n90% accuracy immediately.\nFantastic you think right.\nSo now you start diving deep you go a little deeper.\nAnd you discovered\nthat 90% of that data actually belongs to just one class\ndamn your entire data set.\nYour entire decision is actually biased\nto just one particular class.\nSo Random Forest actually takes care of this thing\nand it is really not biased\ntowards any particular decision tree or any particular variable\nor any class.\nSo it has got methods which looks after it\nand they does is all the balance of errors in your data sets.\nSo that's pretty much\nabout the features of random forests.\nWhat is KNN algorithm\nwill K. Nearest neighbor is a simple algorithm\nthat stores all the available cases\nand classify the new data\nor case based on a similarity measure.\nIt suggests that\nif you are similar to your neighbors,\nthen you are one of them, right?\nFor example,\nif apple looks more similar to banana orange or Melon.\nRather than a monkey rat\nor a cat then most likely Apple belong to the group of fruits.\nAll right.\nWell in general Cayenne is used in Search application\nwhere you are looking for similar items\nthat is when your task is some form of fine items\nsimilar to this one.\nThen you call this search as a Cayenne search.\nBut what is this KN KN?\nWell this K denotes the number of nearest neighbor\nwhich are voting class of the new data\nor the testing data.\nFor example,\nif k equal 1 then the testing data are given the same label\nas a close this Ample in the training set similarly\nif k equal to 3 the labels\nof the three closes classes are checked and the most\ncommon label is assigned to then testing data.\nSo this is\nwhat a KN KN algorithm means so moving on ahead.\nLet's see some of the example of scenarios\nwhere KN is used in the industry.\nSo, let's see the industrial application\nof KNN algorithm starting with recommender system.\nWell the biggest use case\nof cayenne and search is a recommender system.\nThis recommended system is like an automated form\nof a shop counter guy when you asked him for a product.\nNot only shows you the product\nbut also suggest you or displays your relevant set of products,\nwhich are related to the item.\nYou're already interested in buying this KNN algorithm\napplies to recommending products like an Amazon\nor for recommending media,\nlike in case of Netflix or even for recommending advertisement\nto display to a user\nif I'm not wrong almost all of you must have used Amazon\nfor shopping, right?\nSo just to tell you more than 35% of amazon.com revenue\nis generated by its recommendation engine.\nSo what's their strategy Amazon uses?\nRecommendation as a targeted marketing tool\nin both the email campaigns\naround most of its website\nPages Amazon will recommend many products\nfrom different categories based on what you have browser\nand it will pull those products in front of you\nwhich you are likely to buy\nlike the frequently bought together option\nthat comes at the bottom of the product page to tempt you\ninto buying the combo.\nWell, this recommendation has just one main goal\nthat is increase average order value or to upsell\nand cross-sell customers by providing product suggestion\nbased on items in the shopping cart,\nor On the product they are currently looking at on site.\nSo next industrial application of KNN\nalgorithm is concept search\nor searching semantically similar documents\nand classifying documents containing similar topics.\nSo as you know,\nthe data on the Internet is increasing exponentially\nevery single second.\nThere are billions and billions of documents on the internet\neach document on the internet contains multiple Concepts,\nthat could be a potential concept.\nNow, this is a situation\nwhere the main problem is to extract concept\nfrom a set of documents\nas each page could have thousands of combination\nthat could be potential Concepts an average document could have\nmillions of concept combined\nthat the vast amount of data on the web.\nWell, we are talking about an enormous amount\nof data set and Sample.\nSo what we need is we need to find the concept\nfrom the enormous amount of data set and samples, right?\nSo for this purpose,\nwe'll be using KNN algorithm more advanced example\ncould include handwriting detection like an OCR\nor image recognization or even video recognization.\nAll right.\nSo now that you know various use cases\nof KNN algorithm,\nlet's proceed and see how does it work.\nSo how does a KNN algorithm work?\nLet's start by plotting these blue and orange\npoint on our graph.\nSo these Blue Points the belong to class A\nand the orange ones they belong to class B.\nNow you get a star as a new pony and your task is to predict\nwhether this new point it belongs to class A\nor it belongs to the class B.\nSo to start the production, the very first thing\nthat you have to do is select the value of K,\njust as I told you KN KN algorithm refers to the number\nof nearest neighbors that you want to select for example,\nin this case k equal to 3.\nSo what does it mean it means\nthat I am selecting three points\nwhich are the least distance to the new point\nor you can say I am selecting three different points\nwhich are closest to the star.\nWell at this point of time you can ask\nhow will you calculate the least distance?\nSo once you calculate the distance,\nyou will get one blue and two orange points\nwhich are closest to this star now since in this case\nas we have a majority of Inch point so you can see\nthat for k equal 3D star belongs to the class B,\nor you can say\nthat the star is more similar to the orange points\nmoving on ahead.\nWell, what if k equal to 6 well for this case,\nyou have to look for six different points\nwhich are closest to this star.\nSo in this case after calculating the distance,\nwe find that we have four blue points\nand two Orange Point\nwhich are closest to the star now,\nas you can see\nthat the blue points are in majority so you can say\nthat for k equals 6 this star belongs.\nThese two class A or the star is more similar to Blue Points.\nSo by now,\nI guess you know how a KNN algorithm work.\nAnd what is the significance of gain KNN algorithm.\nSo how will you choose the value of K?\nSo keeping in mind this case the most important parameter\nin KNN algorithm.\nSo, let's see when you build a k nearest neighbor classifier.\nHow will you choose a value of K?\nWell, you might have a specific value of K in mind\nor you could divide up your data and use something\nlike cross-validation technique to test several values of K\nin order to determine\nwhich works best for your data.\nExample if n equal 2,000 cases then\nin that case the optimal value of K lies somewhere\nin between 1 to 19.\nBut yes, unless you try it you cannot be sure of it.\nSo, you know how the algorithm is working on a higher level.\nLet's move on and see\nhow things are predicted using KNN algorithm.\nRemember I told you\nthe KNN algorithm uses the least distance measure\nin order to find its nearest neighbors.\nSo let's see how these distances calculated.\nWell, there are several distance measure\nwhich can be used.\nSo to start with Will mainly focus on euclidean distance\nin Manhattan distance in this session.\nSo what is this euclidean distance?\nWell, this euclidean distance is defined as the square root\nof the sum of difference between a new point x\nand an existing Point why\nso for example here we have Point P1 and P2 Point\nP. 1 is 1 1 and point B 2 is 5\nfor so what is the euclidean distance between both of them?\nSo you can say that euclidean distance is\na direct distance between two points.\nSo what is the distance between the point P1 and P2?\nSo we Calculate it as 5 minus 1 whole square\nplus 4 minus 1 whole square\nand we can route it over which results to 5.\nSo next is the Manhattan distance.\nWell, this Manhattan distance is used to calculate the distance\nbetween real Vector using\nthe sum of their absolute difference in this case.\nThe Manhattan distance between the point P1\nand P2 is mod of 5 minus 1 plus mod value of 4 minus 1,\nwhich results to 3 plus 4.\nThat is 7.\nSo this slide shows the difference between euclidean\nand Manhattan distance from point A to point B.\nSo euclidean distance is nothing but the direct\nor the least possible distance between A and B.\nWhereas the Manhattan distance is a distance between A\nand B measured along the axis at right angle.\nLet's take an example and see\nhow things are predicted using KNN algorithm\nor how the cannon algorithm is working suppose.\nWe have data set which consists of height weight\nand T-shirt size of some customers.\nNow when a new customer come we only have is height.\nAnd wait as the information now our task is to predict.\nWhat is the T-shirt size of that particular customer?\nSo for this will be using the KNN algorithm.\nSo the very first thing what we need to do,\nwe need to calculate the euclidean distance.\nSo now that you have a new data of height 160 one centimeter\nand weight as 61 kg.\nSo the very first thing\nthat we'll do is we'll calculate the euclidean distance,\nwhich is nothing but the square root\nof 160 1 minus 158 whole square\nplus 61 minus 58 whole square and square root of that is 4.24.\nLet's drag and drop it.\nSo these are the various euclidean distance\nof other points.\nNow, let's suppose k equal to 5 then the algorithm\nwhat it does is it searches for the five customer\nclosest to the new customer\nthat is most similar to the new data in terms\nof its attribute for k equal 5.\nLet's find the top five minimum euclidian distance.\nSo these are the distance\nwhich we are going to use one two,\nthree, four and five.\nSo let's rank them in the order first.\nThis is second.\nThis is third then this one is Forward and again,\nthis one is five.\nSo there's our order.\nSo for k equal 5 we have for t-shirts\nwhich come under size M and one t-shirt\nwhich comes under size l\nso obviously best guess for the best prediction\nfor the T-shirt size of white 161 centimeters and wait\n60 1 kg is M.\nOr you can say that a new customer fit\ninto size M. Well this was all about the theoretical session.\nBut before we drill down to the coding part,\nlet me just tell you why people call KN as a lazy learner.\nWell KN for classification.\nOcean is a very simple algorithm.\nBut that's not why they are called lazy KN is a lazy learner\nbecause it doesn't have a discriminative function\nfrom the training data.\nBut what it does it memorizes the training data,\nthere is no learning phase of the model and all\nof the work happens at the time.\nYour prediction is requested.\nSo as such there's the reason why KN is often referred\nto us lazy learning algorithm.\nSo this was all about the theoretical session now,\nlet's move on to the coding part.\nSo for the Practical\nimplementation of the Hands-On part,\nI'll be using the artists data set\nso This data set consists of 150 observation.\nWe have four features\nand one class label the four features include\nthe sepal length sepal width petal length and the petrol head\nwhereas the class label decides which flower belongs\nto which category.\nSo this was the description of the data set,\nwhich we are using now,\nlet's move on and see what are the step\nby step solution to perform a KNN algorithm.\nSo first, we'll start by handling the data\nwhat we have to do we have to open the data set\nfrom the CSV format\nand split the data set into train and test part next.\nWe'll take the Clarity where we have to calculate the distance\nbetween two data instances.\nOnce we calculate the distance next we'll look for the neighbor\nand select K Neighbors\nwhich are having the least distance from a new point.\nNow once we get our neighbor,\nthen we'll generate a response from a set of data instances.\nSo this will decide\nwhether the new Point belongs to class A or Class B.\nFinally will create the accuracy function\nand in the end.\nWe'll tie it all together in the main function.\nSo let's start with our code\nfor implementing KNN algorithm using python.\nI'll be using Java.\nOld book by Don 3.0 installed on it.\nNow.\nLet's move on and see\nhow can an algorithm can be implemented using python.\nSo there's my jupyter notebook,\nwhich is a web-based interactive Computing notebook environment\nwith python 3.0 installed on it.\nSo the launch its launching so there's our jupyter notebook\nand we'll be riding our python codes on it.\nSo the first thing\nthat we need to do is load our file our data\nis in CSV format without a header line\nor any code we can open the file the open function\nand read the data line using the reader function.\nIn the CSV module.\nSo let's write a code to load our data file.\nLet's execute the Run button.\nSo once you execute the Run button,\nyou can see the entire training data set as the output next.\nWe need to split the data into a training data set\nthat KN can use to make prediction and a test data set\nthat we can use to evaluate the accuracy of the model.\nSo we first need to convert the flower measure\nthat will load it as string into numbers\nthat we can work next.\nWe need to split the data set randomly to train and test.\nRatio 67's 233 for test is to train as a standard ratio,\nwhich is used for this purpose.\nSo let's define a function\nas load data set\nthat loads a CSV with the provided file\nnamed and split it randomly into training\nand test data set using the provided split ratio.\nSo this is our function load data set which is using filename\nsplit ratio training data set\nand testing data set as its input.\nAll right.\nSo let's execute the Run button and check for any errors.\nSo it's executed with zero errors.\nLet's test this function.\nSo there's our training set testing set load data set.\nSo this is our function load data set on inside\nthat we are passing.\nOur file is data with a split ratio of 0.66\nand training data set and test data set.\nLet's see what our training data set and test data set.\nIt's dividing into so it's giving a count\nof training data set and testing data set.\nThe total number of training data set\nas split into is 97 and total number\nof test data set we have is 53.\nSo total number of training data set we have here is 97 and total\nnumber of test data set we have here is 53.\nAll right.\nOkay, so Function load data set is performing.\nWell, so let's move on to step two\nwhich is similarity.\nSo in order to make prediction,\nwe need to calculate the similarity between\nany two given data instances.\nThis is needed\nso that we can locate the kamo similar data instances\nin the training data set are in turn make a prediction given\nthat all for flower measurement are numeric and have same unit.\nWe can directly use the euclidean distance measure.\nThis is nothing but the square root of the sum\nof squared differences between two areas\nof the number given\nthat all the for flower Are numeric and have\nsame unit we can directly use the euclidean distance measure\nwhich is nothing but the square root of the sum\nof squared difference between two areas\nor the number additionally we want to control\nwhich field to include in the distance calculation.\nSo specifically we only want to include first for attribute.\nSo our approach will be to limit the euclidean distance\nto a fixed length.\nAll right.\nSo let's define our euclidean function.\nSo this are euclidean distance function\nwhich takes instance one instance to and length as\nparameters instance 1 and ends.\nThese two are the two points\nof which you want to calculate the euclidean distance,\nwhereas this length and denote\nthat how many attributes you want to include?\nOkay.\nSo there's our euclidean function.\nLet's execute it.\nIt's executing fine without any errors.\nLet's test the function suppose the data one\nor the first instance consists of the data point has two to two\nand it belongs to class A\nand data to consist of four for four\nand it belongs to class P.\nSo when we calculate the euclidean distance\nof data one to data to and\nwhat we have to do we have to consider only\nfirst three features of them.\nAll right.\nSo let's print the distance as you can see here.\nThe distance comes out to be three point\nfour six four now like so this is nothing\nbut the square root of 4 minus 2 whole Square.\nSo this distance is nothing but the euclidean distance\nand it is calculated as square root of 4 minus 2 whole square\nplus 4 minus 2 whole square\nthat is nothing but 3 times of 4 minus 2 whole square\nthat is 12 + square root\nof 12 is nothing but 3.46 for all right.\nSo now that we have calculated the distance now we need to look\nfor K nearest.\nNeighbors now that we have a similarity measure\nwe can use it to collect the kamo similar instances\nfor a given unseen instance.\nWell, this is a straightforward process\nof calculating the distance for all the instances\nand selecting a subset with the smallest distance value.\nAnd now what we have to do we have to select\nthe smallest distance values.\nSo for that will be defining a function\nas get neighbors.\nSo for that\nwhat we will be doing will be defining a function\nas get neighbors\nwhat it will do it will return the K most similar Neighbors\nFrom the training set for a given test instance.\nAll right, so this is how our get neighbors In look\nlike it takes training data set\nand test instance and K as its input here.\nThe K is nothing but the number\nof nearest neighbor you want to check for.\nAll right.\nSo basically what you'll be getting\nfrom this get Mabel's function is K different points\nhaving least euclidean distance from the test instance.\nAll right, let's execute it.\nSo the function executed without any errors.\nSo let's test our function.\nSo suppose the training data set includes the data like to to\nto and it belongs to class A\nand other data includes four four four and it belongs\nto class P and at testing and Census 555 or now,\nwe have to predict\nwhether this test instance belongs to class A\nor it belongs to class be.\nAll right for k equal 1 we have to predict\nits nearest neighbor and predict\nwhether this test instance it will belong to class A\nor will it belong to class be?\nAlright.\nSo let's execute the Run button.\nAll right.\nSo an executing the Run button you can see\nthat we have output as for for for\nand be a new instance\n5 5 5 is closes 2.44 for which belongs to class be.\nAll right.\nNow once you have located the most similar neighbor\nfor a test instance next task is to predict a response based\non those neighbors.\nSo how we can do that.\nWell, we can do this\nby allowing each neighbor to vote for the class attribute\nand take the majority vote as a prediction.\nLet's see how we can do that.\nSo we are function\nas getresponse with takes neighbors as the input.\nWell, this neighbor was nothing but the output of this get me /\nfunction the output\nof get me were function will be fed to get response.\nAll right.\nLet's execute the Run button.\nIt's executed.\nLet's move ahead and test our function get response.\nSo we have a But as bun bun bun it belongs to class\nA 2 2 2 it belongs to class a33.\nIt belongs to class B.\nSo this response, that's what it will do.\nIt will store the value of get response by passing\nthis neighbor value.\nI like so what we want to check is we want to predict\nwhether that test instance final outcome will belongs\nto class A or Class B.\nWhen the neighbors are 1 1 1 a 2 2 A + 3 3 B.\nSo, let's check our response.\nNow that we have created all the different function\nwhich are required for a KNN algorithm.\nSo important main concern is\nhow do you evaluate the accuracy of the prediction\nand easy way to evaluate\nthe accuracy of the model is to calculate a ratio\nof the total correct prediction to all the protection made.\nSo for this I will be defining function\nas get accuracy and inside\nthat I'll be passing my test data set\nand the predictions get accuracy function check\nget executed without any error.\nLet's check it for a sample data set.\nSo we have our test data set as 1 1 1 It belongs to class A 2/2\nwhich again belongs to class 3 3 3 which belongs to class B\nand my predictions is for first test data.\nIt predicted latter belongs to class A which is true\nfor next it predicted that belongs to class C,\nwhich is again to and for the next again and predictive\nthat it belongs to class A which is false in this case\ncause the test data belongs to class be.\nAll right.\nSo in total we have to correct prediction out of three.\nAll right, so the ratio will be 2 by 3,\nwhich is nothing but 66.6.\nSo our accuracy rate is 66.6.\nIt's so now that you have created all the function\nthat are required for KNN algorithm.\nLet's compile them into one single main function.\nAlright, so this is our main function\nand we are using Iris data set\nwith a split of 0.67 and the value of K is 3 Let's see.\nWhat is the accuracy score of this check\nhow accurate are modulus so in training data set,\nwe have a hundred and thirteen values\nand then the test data set.\nWe have 37 values.\nThese are the predicted\nand the actual values of the output.\nOkay.\nSo in total we got an accuracy of 90s.\nIn point two nine percent, which is really very good.\nAlright, so I hope the concept of this KNN algorithm is\nhere device in a world full of machine learning\nand artificial intelligence surrounding almost everything\naround us classification\nand prediction is one\nof the most important aspects of machine learning.\nSo before moving forward,\nlet's have a quick look at the agenda.\nI'll start off this video by explaining you guys\nwhat exactly is Nave biased\nthen we'll and what is Bayes theorem\nwhich serves as a logic\nbehind the name pass algorithm going forward.\nI'll explain the steps involved\nin the neighbors algorithm one by one\nand finally add finish of this video with a demo\non the Nave bass using the SQL own package noun\na bass is a simple but surprisingly powerful algorithm\nfrom penetrative analysis.\nIt is a classification technique based on base theorem\nwith an assumption of Independence among predictors.\nIt comprises of two parts, which is name.\nAnd bias in simple terms neighbors classifier assumes\nthat the presence of a particular feature\nin a class is unrelated to the presence\nof any other feature,\neven if this features depend on each other\nor upon the existence of the other features,\nall of these properties independently contribute\nto the probability\nwhether a fruit is an apple or an orange or a banana.\nSo that is why it\nis known as naive now naive based model is easy to build\nand particularly useful for very large data sets.\nIn probability Theory and statistics based theorem,\nwhich is already known as the base law\nor the base rule describes the probability of an event\nbased on prior knowledge of the conditions\nthat might be related to the event now paste\ntheorem is a way to figure out conditional probability.\nThe conditional probability is the probability\nof an event happening given\nthat it has some relationship to one or more other events.\nFor example, your probability of getting a parking space\nis connected to the time of the day you pass.\nWhere you park\nand what conventions are you going on at that time\nbased Serum is slightly more nuanced in a nutshell.\nIt gives you an actual probability of an event given\ninformation about the tests.\nNow, if you look at the definition\nof Bayes theorem,\nwe can see that given a hypothesis H\nand the evidence e-base term states that\nthe relationship between the probability of the hypothesis\nbefore getting the evidence\nwhich is the P of H and the probability\nof the hypothesis after getting the evidence\nthat P of H given e is defined as probability\nof e given H into probability\nof H divided by probability of e it's rather confusing, right?\nSo let's take an example to understand this theorem.\nSo suppose I have a deck of cards and\nif a single card is drawn from the deck of playing cards,\nthe probability that the card is a king is for by 52\nsince there are four Kings in a standard deck of 52 cards.\nNow if King is an event, this card is a king.\nThe probability of King is given as 4 by 52\nthat is equal to 1 by 13.\nNow if the evidence is provided for instance someone looks\nas the That the single card is a face card the probability\nof King given\nthat it's a face can be calculated\nusing the base theorem by this formula.\nThe since every King is also a face card\nthe probability of face given\nthat it's a king is equal to 1\nand since there are three face cards in each suit.\nThat is the chat king and queen.\nThe probability of the face card is equal to 12 by 52.\nThat is 3 by 30.\nNow using Bayes theorem we can find out the probability\nof King given that it's a face\nso our final answer comes to 1 by 3,\nwhich is also true.\nSo if you have a deck of cards\nwhich has having only faces now there are three types of phases\nwhich are the chat king and queen so the probability\nthat it's the king is 1 by 3.\nNow.\nThis is the simple example of how based on works now\nif we look at the proof as in how this Bayes theorem Evolved.\nSo here we have probability of a given p\nand probability of B given a now for\na joint probability distribution over the sets A and B,\nthe probability of a intersection B,\nthe conditional probability of a given B is defined\nas the probability\nof a intersection B divided by probability of B,\nand similarly probability of B,\ngiven a is defined as probability of B intersection\na divided by probability of a now we can\nEquate probability of a intersection p and probability\nof B intersection a as both are the same thing now\nfrom this method\nas you can see,\nwe get our final base theorem proof,\nwhich is the probability of a given b equals probability of B,\ngiven a into probability\nof P divided by the probability of a now\nwhile this is the equation\nthat applies to any probability distribution\nover the events A and B.\nIt has a particular nice interpretation in case\nwhere a is represented as the hypothesis h\nand B is represented\nas some observed evidence e in that case the formula is p\nof H given e is equal\nto P of e given H\ninto probability of H divided by probability of e now\nthis relates the probability\nof hypotheses before getting the evidence,\nwhich is p of H to the probability\nof the hypothesis after getting the evidence\nwhich is p of H given e\nfor this reason P of H is known as the prior probability\nwhile P of Each given e is known as the posterior probability\nand the factor\nthat relates the two is known as the likelihood ratio Now using\nthis term space theorem can be rephrased\nas the posterior probability equals.\nThe prior probability times the likelihood ratio.\nSo now that we know the maths\nwhich is involved behind the baster.\nMm.\nLet's see how we can implement this in real life scenario.\nSo suppose we have a data set.\nIn which we have the Outlook the humidity\nand we need to find out\nwhether we should play or not on that day.\nSo the Outlook can be sunny overcast rain\nand the humidity high normal\nand the wind are categorized into two phases\nwhich are the weak and the strong winds.\nThe first of all will create a frequency table using\neach attribute of the data set.\nSo the frequency table for the Outlook looks\nlike this we have Sunny overcast and rainy the frequency table\nof humidity looks like this\nand Frequency table of when looks like this we have strong\nand weak for wind and high and normal ranges for humidity.\nSo for each frequency table,\nwe will generate a likelihood table now now\nthe likelihood table contains the probability\nof a particular day suppose we take the sunny\nand we take the play as yes\nand no so the probability of Sunny given\nthat we play yes is 3 by 10,\nwhich is 0.3 the probability of X,\nwhich is the probability of Sunny\nIs equal to 5 by 14 now,\nthese are all the terms\nwhich are just generated from the data\nwhich we have a\nand finally the probability of yes is 10 out of 14.\nSo if we have a look at the likelihood of yes given\nthat it's a sunny we can see using Bayes theorem.\nIt's the probability of Sunny given yes\ninto probability of s divided by the probability of Sunny.\nSo we have all the values here calculated.\nSo if you put that in our base serum equation,\nwe get the likelihood of yes.\nA 0.59 similarly the likelihood\nof no can also be calculated here is 0.40 now similarly.\nWe are going to create the likelihood table\nfor both the humidity\nand the win there's a\nfor humidity the likelihood for yes given the humidity\nis high is equal to 0.4 to and the probability\nof playing know given the vent is high is 0.58.\nThe similarly for table wind the probability of he has given\nthat the wind is week is 0.75 and the probability of no given\nthat the win is week is 0.25 now suppose we have of day\nwhich has high rain\nwhich has high humidity and the wind is weak.\nSo should we play or not?\nThat's our for that?\nWe use the base theorem here again the likelihood\nof yes on that day is equal\nto the probability of Outlook rain given\nthat it's a yes into probability of Magic given that say yes,\nand the probability of when that is we given\nthat it's we are playing yes into the probability of yes,\nwhich equals to zero point zero one nine\nand similarly the likelihood of know on that day is equal\nto zero point zero one six.\nNow if we look\nat the probability of yes for that day\nof playing we just need to divide it\nwith the likelihood some of both the yes\nand no so the probability of playing tomorrow,\nwhich is yes is 5\nwhereas the probability of not playing is equal to 0.45.\nNow.\nThis is based upon the data which we already have with us.\nSo now that you have an idea of what exactly is named bias\nhow it works and we have seen\nhow it can be implemented on a particular data set.\nLet's see where it is used in the industry.\nThe started with our first industrial use case,\nwhich is news categorization or we can use\nthe term text classification to broaden the spectrum\nof this algorithm news\nin the web are rapidly growing in the era of Information Age\nwhere each new site has its own different layout\nand categorization for grouping news.\nNow these heterogeneity\nof layout and categorization cannot always satisfy\nindividual users need to remove these heterogeneity\nand classifying the news articles.\nOwing to the user preference is a formidable task companies\nuse web crawler to extract useful text\nfrom HTML Pages the news articles\nand each of these news articles\nis then tokenized now these tokens are nothing\nbut the categories of the news now\nin order to achieve better classification result.\nWe remove the less significant Words,\nwhich are the stop was from the documents\nor the Articles\nand then we apply the Nave base classifier\nfor classifying the news contents based on the news.\nNow this is by far one\nof the best examples of Neighbors classifier,\nwhich is Spam filtering.\nNow.\nIt's the Nave Bayes classifier are\na popular statistical technique for email filtering.\nThey typically use bag of words features to identify\nat the spam email\nand approach commonly used in text classification as well.\nNow it works by correlating the use of tokens,\nbut the spam and non-spam emails and then the Bayes theorem,\nwhich I explained\nearlier is used to calculate the probability\nthat an email is\nor not a Spam so named by a Spam filtering is\na baseline technique for dealing with Spam\nthat container itself\nto the emails need of an individual user\nand give low false positive spam detection rates\nthat are generally acceptable to users.\nIt is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering\nwith its roots\nin the 1990s particular words have particular probabilities\nof occurring in spam.\nAnd and legitimate email as well for instance.\nMost emails users\nwill frequently encounter the world lottery\nor the lucky draw a spam email,\nbut we'll sell them see it in other emails.\nThe filter doesn't know these probabilities in advance\nand must be friends.\nSo it can build them up to train the filter.\nThe user must manually indicate\nwhether a new email is Spam or not for all the words\nin each straining email.\nThe filter will adjust the probability\nthat each word will appear in a Spam or legitimate.\nOwl in the database now\nafter training the word probabilities also known\nas the likelihood functions are used to compute the probability\nthat an email with a particular set of words as in in belongs\nto either category each word\nin the email contributes the email spam probability.\nThis contribution is called the posterior probability\nand is computed again using the base 0\nthen the email spam probability\nis computed over all the verse in the email\nand if the total exceeds a certain threshold say\nOr 95% the filter will Mark the email as spam.\nNow object detection is the process of finding instances\nof real-world objects such as faces bicycles\nand buildings in images\nor video now object detection\nalgorithm typically use extracted features\nand learning algorithm\nto recognize instance of an object category here again,\na bass plays an important role of categorization\nand classification of object now medical area.\nThis is increasingly voluminous amount of electronic data,\nwhich are becoming more and more complicated.\nThe produced medical data has certain characteristics\nthat make the analysis very challenging and attractive\nas well among all the different approaches.\nThe knave bias is used.\nIt is the most effective and efficient classification\nalgorithm and has been successfully applied\nto many medical problems empirical comparison\nof knave bias versus five popular classifiers\non Medical data sets shows\nthat may bias is well suited for medical application and has\nhigh performance in most of the examine medical problems.\nNow in the past various testicle methods have been used\nfor modeling in the area of disease diagnosis.\nThese methods require prior assumptions and are\nless capable of dealing\nwith massive and complicated nonlinear and dependent data one\nof the main advantages of neighbor as approach\nwhich is appealing to Physicians is\nthat all the available information is used?\nTo explain the decision this explanation seems\nto be natural for medical diagnosis and prognosis.\nThat is it is very close to the way\nhow physician diagnosed patients now weather is one\nof the most influential factor in our daily life to an extent\nthat it may affect the economy of a country\nthat depends on occupation like agriculture.\nTherefore as a countermeasure to reduce the damage\ncaused by uncertainty in whether Behavior,\nthere should be an efficient way to print the weather now\nwhether projecting has Challenging problem\nin the meteorological department\nsince ears even after the technology skill\nand scientific advancement the accuracy\nand protection of weather has never been sufficient even\nin current day this domain remains as a research topic\nin which scientists\nand mathematicians are working to produce a model\nor an algorithm\nthat will accurately predict the weather now\na bias in approach based model is created by\nwhere posterior probabilities are used to calculate\nthe likelihood of each class label for input.\nData instance and the one with the maximum likelihood\nis considered as the resulting output now earlier.\nWe saw a small implementation of this algorithm as well\nwhere we predicted\nwhether we should play or not based on the data,\nwhich we have collected earlier.\nNow, this is a python Library\nwhich is known as scikit-learn it helps to build in a bias\nand model in Python.\nNow, there are three types of named by ass model\nunder scikit-learn Library.\nThe first one is the caution.\nIt is used in classification and it Assumes\nthat the feature follow a normal distribution.\nThe next we have is multinomial.\nIt is used for discrete counts.\nFor example, let's say we have a text classification problem\nand here we consider bernouli trials,\nwhich is one step further\nand instead of word occurring in the document.\nWe have count\nhow often word occurs\nin the document you can think of it\nas a number of times outcomes number is observed\nin the given number of Trials.\nAnd finally we have the bernouli type.\nOf neighbors.\nThe binomial model is useful\nif your feature vectors are binary bag of words model\nwhere the once\nand the zeros are words occur in the document and the verse\nwhich do not occur\nin the document respectively based on their data set.\nYou can choose any of the given discussed model here,\nwhich is the gaussian the multinomial or the bernouli.\nSo let's understand how this algorithm works.\nAnd what are the different steps?\nOne can take to create a bison model and use knave bias\nto predict the output so here to understand better.\nWe are going to predict the onset of diabetes Now\nthis problem comprises\nof 768 observations of medical details\nfor Pima Indian patients.\nThe record describes instantaneous measurement taken\nfrom the patient such as the age the number\nof times pregnant\nand the blood work crew now all the patients are women aged 21\nand Older and all the attributes are numeric\nand the unit's vary from attribute to attribute.\nEach record has a class value that indicate\nwhether the patient suffered on onset of diabetes\nwithin five years are the measurements.\nNow.\nThese are classified as 0 now.\nI've broken the whole process down into the following steps.\nThe first step is handling the data\nin which we load the data from the CSV file and split it\ninto training and test it\nas it's the second step is summarizing the data.\nIn which we summarize\nthe properties in the training data sets so that we\ncan calculate the probabilities and make predictions.\nNow the third step comes is making a particular prediction.\nWe use the summaries\nof the data set to generate a single prediction.\nAnd after that we generate predictions given a test data\nset and a summarized training data sets.\nAnd finally we evaluate\nthe accuracy of the predictions made for a test data set\nas the percentage correct out of all the predictions made\nand finally We tied together and form.\nOur own model of nape is classifier.\nNow.\nThe first thing we need to do is load our data the data is\nin the CSV format without a header line\nor any codes.\nWe can open the file with the open function\nand read the data lines using the read functions\nin the CSV module.\nNow, we also need to convert the attributes\nthat were loaded as strings into numbers\nso that we can work with them.\nSo let me show you\nhow this can be implemented now for that you need to Tall python\non a system and use the jupyter notebook\nor the python shell.\nHey, I'm using the Anaconda Navigator\nwhich has all\nthe things required to do the programming in Python.\nWe have the Jupiter lab.\nWe have the notebook.\nWe have the QT console.\nEven we have a studio as well.\nSo what you need to do is just install the Anaconda Navigator\nit comes with the pre installed python also,\nso the moment you click launch on The jupyter Notebook.\nIt will take you to the Jupiter homepage\nin a local system and here you can do programming in Python.\nSo let me just rename it as by my India diabetes.\nSo first, we need to load the data set.\nSo I'm creating here a function load CSV now before that.\nWe need to import certain CSV the math\nand the random method.\nSo as you can see,\nI've created a load CSV function\nwhich will take the pie my Indian diabetes\ndata dot CSV file using the CSV dot read a method\nand then we are converting every element of that data set\ninto float originally all the ants are in string,\nbut we need to convert them into floor\nfor all calculation purposes.\nThe next we need to split the data into training data sets\nthat nay bias can use to make the prediction\nand this data set\nthat we can use to evaluate the accuracy of the model.\nWe need to split the data set randomly into training\nand testing data set in the ratio of usually\nwhich is 7230.\nBut for this example,\nI'm going to use 67\nand 33 now 70 and 30 is a Ratio for testing algorithms\nso you can play around with this number.\nSo this is our split data set function.\nNow the Navy base model is comprised\nof summary of the data in the training data set.\nNow this summary is then used while making predictions.\nNow the summary of the training data\ncollected involves the mean the standard deviation\nof each attribute by class value now, for example,\nif there are two class values and seven numerical attributes,\nthen we need a mean\nand the standard deviation for each of these seven attributes\nand the class value\nwhich makes The 14 attributes summaries\nso we can break the preparation\nof this summary down into the following sub tasks\nwhich are the separating data by class calculating mean\ncalculating standard deviation summarizing the data sets\nand summarizing attributes by class.\nSo the first task is to separate\nthe training data set instances by class value\nso that we can calculate statistics for each class.\nWe can do that by creating a map\nof each class value to a list of instances\nthat belong to the class.\nClass and sort the entire dataset of instances\ninto the appropriate list.\nNow the separate by class function just the same.\nSo as you can see the function assumes\nthat the last attribute is the class value\nthe function returns a map of class value to the list\nof data instances next.\nWe need to calculate the mean of each attribute\nfor a class value.\nNow, the mean is\nthe central middle or the central tendency of the data\nand we use it as a middle of our gaussian distribution\nwhen Calculating the probabilities.\nSo this is our function for mean now.\nWe also need to calculate the standard deviation\nof each attribute for a class value.\nThe standard deviation is calculated as a square root\nof the variance\nand the variance is calculated as the average\nof the squared differences\nfor each attribute value\nfrom the mean now one thing to note\nthat here is\nthat we are using n minus one method\nwhich subtracts one\nfrom the number of attributes values\nwhen calculating the variance.\nNow that we have the tools to summarize the data\nfor a given list of instances.\nWe can calculate the mean and standard deviation\nfor each attribute.\nNow that's if function groups the values for each attribute\nacross our data instances into their own lists\nso that we can compute the mean and standard deviation values\nfor each attribute.\nNow next comes the summarizing attributes by class.\nWe can pull it all together by first separating.\nOur training data sets into instances groped by class\nthen calculating the summaries for each a Should be now.\nWe are ready to make predictions using the summaries prepared\nfrom our training data\nmaking patients involved calculating the probability\nthat a given data instance belong to each class then\nselecting the class\nwith the largest probability as a prediction.\nNow we can divide this whole method into four tasks\nwhich are the calculating gaussian probability density\nfunction calculating class probability making a prediction\nand then estimating the accuracy\nnow to calculate the gaussian probability density function.\nWe use the gaussian function to estimate the probability\nof a given attribute value given the node mean\nand the standard deviation of the attribute estimated\nfrom the training data.\nAs you can see the parameters RX mean\nand the standard deviation now\nin the calculate probability function,\nwe calculate the exponent first then calculate the main division\nthis lets us fit the equation nicely into two lines.\nNow, the next task\nis calculating the class properties now\nthat we had can calculate the probability of an attribute\nbelonging to a class.\nWe can combine the probabilities of all the attributes values\nfor a data instance and come up with a probability\nof the entire.\nOur data instance belonging to the class.\nSo now that we have calculated the class properties.\nIt's time to finally make our first prediction now,\nwe can calculate the probability of the data instance belong\nto each class value\nand we can look for the largest probability\nand return the associated class\nand for that we are going to use this function predict\nwhich uses the summaries\nand the input Vector which is basically all the probabilities\nwhich are being input for a particular label\nnow finally we can An estimate the accuracy\nof the model by making predictions\nfor each data instances in our test data for that.\nWe use the get predictions method.\nNow this method is used\nto calculate the predictions based upon the test data sets\nand the summary of the training data set.\nNow, the predictions can be compared\nto the class values in our test data set\nand classification accuracy can be calculated as\nan accuracy ratio between the zeros\nand the hundred percent.\nNow the get accuracy method will calculate this accuracy ratio.\nNow finally to sum it all up.\nWe Define our main function we call all these methods\nwhich we have defined earlier one by one to get\nthe Courtesy of the model which we have created.\nSo as you can see,\nthis is our main function in which we have the file name.\nWe have defined the split ratio.\nWe have the data set.\nWe have the training and test data set.\nWe are using the split data set method next.\nWe are using the summarized by class function using\nthe get protection and the get accuracy method as well.\nSo guys as you can see the output of this one gives us\nthat we are splitting the 768 Rose into 514\nwhich is the training and 254\nwhich is the test data set rows and the accuracy of this model\nis 68% Now we can play with the amount of training\nand test data sets which are to be used\nso we can change the split ratio to seventies.\n238 is 220 to get different sort of accuracy.\nSo suppose I change the split ratio from 0.67 20.8.\nSo as you can see,\nwe get the accuracy of 62 percent.\nSo splitting it into 0.67 gave us a better result\nwhich was 68 percent.\nSo this is how you can Implement Navy bias caution classifier.\nThese are the step by step methods\nwhich you need to do in case of using the Nave Bayes classifier,\nbut don't worry.\nWe do not need to write all this many lines\nof code to make a model this with the second.\nAnd I really comes into picture the scikit-learn library has\na predefined method\nor as say a predefined function of nape bias,\nwhich converts all of these lines,\nof course into merely just two or three lines of codes.\nSo, let me just open another jupyter notebook.\nSo let me name it as sklearn a pass.\nNow here we are going to use the most famous data set\nwhich is the iris De Casa.\nNow, the iris flower data set is a multivariate\ndata set introduced by the British statistician\nand biologists Roland Fisher\nand based on this fish is linear discriminant model this data set\nbecame a typical test case\nfor many statistical classification techniques\nin machine learning.\nSo here we are going to use the caution NB model,\nwhich is already available in the sklearn.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nthere were three types of Neighbors\nwhich are the question multinomial and the bernouli.\nSo here we are going to use the caution and be model\nwhich is already present in the SK loan Library,\nwhich is the cycle in library.\nSo first of all,\nwhat we need to do is import the sklearn data sets\nand the metrics and we also need to import the caution NB Now\nonce all these libraries\nare lowered we need to load the data set\nwhich is the iris dataset.\nThe next what we need to do is fit a Nave\nby a smaller to this data set.\nSo as you can see we have so easily defined the model\nwhich is the gaussian NB which contains\nall the programming\nwhich I just showed you earlier all the methods\nwhich are taking the input calculating the mean\nthe standard deviation separating it bike last\nand finally making predictions.\nCalculating the prediction accuracy.\nAll of this comes under the caution and be method\nwhich is inside already present in the sklearn library.\nWe just need to fit it according to the data set\nwhich we have so next\nif we print the model we see which is the gaussian NB model.\nThe next what we need to do is make the predictions.\nSo the expected output is data set dot Target\nand the projected is using the pretend model\nand the model we are using is the cause in N be here.\nNow to summarize the model\nwhich created we calculate the confusion Matrix\nand the classification report.\nSo guys, as you can see the classification to provide\nwe have the Precision of Point Ninety Six,\nwe have the recall of 0.96.\nWe have the F1 score\nand the support and finally if we print our confusion Matrix,\nas you can see it gives us this output.\nSo as you can see using the gaussian\nand we method just putting it in the model\nand using any of the data.\nfitting the model\nwhich you created into a particular data set\nand getting the desired output is so easy\nwith the scikit-learn library\nas we Mo support Vector machine is one\nof the most effective machine learning classifier\nand it has been used in various Fields\nsuch as face recognition cancer classification\nand so on today's session\nis dedicated to how svm works the various features of svm\nand how it Is used in the real world.\nAll right.\nOkay.\nNow let's move on and see what svm algorithm is all about.\nSo guys s VM\nor support Vector machine is a supervised learning algorithm,\nwhich is mainly used to classify data into different classes now\nunlike most algorithms svm makes use of a hyperplane\nwhich acts like a decision boundary\nbetween the various classes\nin general svm can be used to generate\nmultiple separating hyperplanes\nso that the data is Divided into segments.\nOkay, and each\nof these segments will contain only one kind of data.\nIt's mainly used\nfor classification purpose wearing you want to classify\nor data into two different segments depending\non the features of the data.\nNow before moving any further,\nlet's discuss a few features of svm.\nLike I mentioned earlier svm is a supervised learning algorithm.\nThis means that svm trains\non a set of labeled data svm studies the label training data\nand then classifies any new input Data,\ndepending on what it learned\nin the training phase a main advantage\nof support Vector machine is\nthat it can be used for both classification\nand regression problems.\nAll right.\nNow even though svm is mainly known for classification the svr\nwhich is the support Vector regressor is used\nfor regression problems.\nAll right, so svm can be used both for classification.\nAnd for regression.\nNow, this is one of the reasons why a lot of people prefer svm\nbecause it's a very good classifier and along\nThat it is also used for regression.\nOkay.\nAnother feature is the svm kernel functions svm can be used\nfor classifying nonlinear data\nby using the kernel trick the kernel trick basically\nmeans to transform your data into another dimension\nso that you can easily draw a hyperplane\nbetween the different classes of the data.\nAlright, nonlinear data is basically data\nwhich cannot be separated with a straight line.\nAlright, so svm can even be used on nonlinear data sets.\nYou just have to use a A kernel functions to do this.\nAll right.\nSo guys, I hope you all are clear\nwith the basic concepts of svm.\nNow, let's move on and look at how svm works\nso there's an order to understand how svm Works\nlet's consider a small scenario now for a second pretend\nthat you own a firm.\nOkay, and let's say that you have a problem\nand you want to set up a fence to protect your rabbits\nfrom the pack of wolves.\nOkay, but where do you\nbuild your films one way to get around?\nThe problem is to build a classifier based.\nOn the position of the rabbits and words in your pasture.\nSo what I'm telling you is you can classify the group\nof rabbits as one group\nand draw a decision boundary between the rabbits\nand the world correct.\nSo if I do that and if I try to draw a decision boundary\nbetween the rabbits and the Wolves,\nit looks something like this.\nOkay.\nNow you can clearly build a fence along this line\nin simple terms.\nThis is exactly\nhow SPM work it draws a decision boundary,\nwhich is a hyperplane\nbetween any New classes in order to separate them\nor classify them now.\nI know you're thinking how do you know\nwhere to draw a hyperplane\nthe basic principle behind svm is to draw a hyperplane\nthat best separates the two classes\nin our case the two glasses of the rabbits and the Wolves.\nSo you start off by drawing a random hyperplane\nand then you check the distance between the hyperplane\nand the closest data points\nfrom each Club these closes on your is data points\nto the hyperplane are known as support vectors.\nAnd that's where the name comes from support Vector machine.\nSo basically the hyperplane is drawn\nbased on these support vectors.\nSo guys an optimal hyperplane will have\na maximum distance from each of these support vectors.\nAll right.\nSo basically the hyperplane which has the maximum distance\nfrom the support vectors is the most optimal hyperplane\nand this distance between the hyperplane\nand the support vectors is known as the margin.\nAll right,\nso to sum it up svm is used to classify data.\nBy using a hyper plane such that the distance\nbetween the hyperplane and the support vectors is maximum.\nSo basically your margin has to be maximum.\nAll right, that way,\nyou know that you're actually separating your classes or add\nbecause the distance between the two classes is maximum.\nOkay.\nNow, let's try to solve a problem.\nOkay.\nSo let's say that I input a new data point.\nOkay.\nThis is a new data point\nand now I want to draw a hyper plane such\nthat it best separates the two classes.\nOkay, so I start off by drawing a hyperplane.\nLike this and then I check the distance\nbetween the hyperplane and the support vectors.\nOkay, so I'm trying to check\nif the margin is maximum for this hyper plane,\nbut what if I draw a hyperplane which is like this?\nAll right.\nNow I'm going to check the support vectors over here.\nThen I'm going to check the distance\nfrom the support vectors and for this hyperplane, it's clear\nthat the margin is more red.\nWhen you compare the margin of the previous one\nto this hyperplane.\nIt is more.\nSo the reason why I'm choosing this hyperplane is\nbecause the Distance between the support vectors\nand the hyperplane is maximum in this scenario.\nOkay.\nSo guys, this is how you choose a hyperplane.\nYou basically have to make sure\nthat the hyper plane has a maximum.\nMargin.\nAll right, it has to best separate the two classes.\nAll right.\nOkay so far it was quite easy.\nOur data was linearly separable\nwhich means that you could draw a straight line\nto separate the two classes.\nAll right, but what will you do?\nIf the data set is like this\nyou possibly can't draw a hyperplane like Is on it,\nit doesn't separate the two classes at all.\nSo what do you do\nin such situations now earlier in the session I mentioned\nhow a kernel can be used to transform data\ninto another dimension\nthat has a clear dividing margin between the classes of data.\nAlright, so kernel functions offer the user this option\nof transforming nonlinear spaces into linear ones.\nNonlinear data set is the one\nthat you can't separate using a straight line.\nAll right.\nIn order to deal with such data sets,\nyou're going to transform them into linear data sets\nand then use svm on them.\nOkay.\nSo simple trick would be to transform the two variables\nX and Y into a new feature space involving\na new variable called Z.\nAll right, so guys so far we were plotting our data\non two dimensional space.\nCorrect?\nWe will only using the X\nand the y axis so we had only those two variables X and Y now\nin order to deal with this kind of data a simple trick.\nBe to transform the two variables X\nand Y into a new feature space involving a new variable\ncalled Z. Okay,\nso we're basically visualizing the data\non a three-dimensional space.\nNow when you transform the 2D space into a 3D space\nyou can clearly see a dividing margin\nbetween the two classes of data right now.\nYou can go ahead and separate the two classes\nby drawing the best hyperplane between them.\nOkay, that's exactly\nwhat we discussed in the previous slides.\nSo guys, why don't you try this yourself dried.\nDrawing a hyperplane,\nwhich is the most Optimum for these two classes.\nAll right, so guys,\nI hope you have a good understanding\nabout nonlinear svm's now.\nLet's look at a real world use case\nif support Vector machines.\nSo guys s VM\nas a classifier has been used in cancer classification\nsince the early 2000s.\nSo there was an experiment held by a group of professionals\nwho applied svm in a colon cancer tissue classification.\nSo the data set consisted of about\nTransmembrane protein samples\nand only about 50 to 200 genes samples were input\nInto the svm classifier\nNow this sample\nwhich was input\ninto the svm classifier had both colon cancer tissue samples\nand normal colon tissue samples right now.\nThe main objective of this study was to classify Gene samples\nbased on whether they are cancerous or not.\nOkay, so svm was trained using the 50 to 200 samples\nin order to discriminate between non-tumor\nfrom A tumor specimens.\nSo the performance\nof the svm classifier was very accurate\nfor even a small data set.\nAll right, we had only 50 to 200 samples and even\nfor the small data set svm was pretty accurate\nwith this results.\nNot only that its performance was compared\nto other classification algorithms like naive Bayes\nand in each case svm outperform naive Bayes.\nSo after this experiment it was clear\nthat svm classified the data more effectively and it\nworked exceptionally good.\nSmall data sets.\nLet's go ahead\nand understand what exactly is unsupervised learning.\nSo sometimes the given data is unstructured and unlabeled\nso it becomes difficult to classify the data\ninto different categories.\nSo unsupervised learning helps to solve this problem.\nThis learning is used to Cluster the input data\nand classes on the basis of their statistical properties.\nSo example, we can cluster\nDifferent Bikes based upon the speed limit there.\nAcceleration or the average\nthat they are giving so\nand suppose learning is a type of machine learning algorithm\nused to draw inferences\nfrom beta sets consisting of input data\nwithout labeled responses.\nSo if you have a look at the workflow\nor the process flow of unsupervised learning,\nso the training data is collection of information\nwithout any label.\nWe have the machine learning algorithm\nand then we have the clustering malls.\nSo what it does is\nthat distributes the data into a different class.\nAnd again, if you provide any unreliable new data,\nit will make a prediction\nand find out to which cluster that particular data\nor the data set belongs\nto or the particular data point belongs to so one\nof the most important\nalgorithms in unsupervised learning is clustering.\nSo let's understand exactly what is clustering.\nSo a clustering\nbasically is the process of dividing the data sets\ninto groups consisting of similar data points.\nIt means grouping of objects based\non the information found in the data describing the object.\nObjects or their relationships\nso clustering malls focus on\nand defying groups of similar records\nand labeling records\naccording to the group to which they belong now this is done\nwithout the benefit of prior knowledge\nabout the groups and their characteristics.\nSo and in fact,\nwe may not even know exactly how many groups are\nthere to look for.\nNow.\nThese models are often referred to as\nunsupervised learning models,\nsince there's no external standard by which to judge.\nOne is classification performance.\nThere are no right or wrong answers to these model.\nAnd if we talk about why clustering is used\nso the goal of clustering is to determine\nthe intrinsic group in a set of unlabeled data sometime.\nThe partitioning is the goal\nor the purpose of clustering algorithm is to make sense\nof and exact value\nfrom the last set of structured and unstructured data.\nSo that is why clustering is used in the industry and\nif you have a look at the video,\nThese use cases of clustering in the industry.\nSo first of all, it's being used in marketing.\nSo discovering distinct groups\nin customer databases such as customers\nwho make a lot of long-distance calls customers\nwho use internet more\nthan cause they're also using insurance companies.\nSo like I need to find groups of Corporation insurance policy\nholders with high average claim rate Farmers crash cops,\nwhich is profitable.\nThey are using C Smith studies and defined problem areas of Oil\nor gas exploration Based on seesmic data,\nand they're also used in the recommendation of movies.\nIf you would say they are also used in Flickr photos.\nThey also used by Amazon\nfor recommending the product which category it lies in.\nSo basically if we talk\nabout clustering there are three types of clustering.\nSo first of all,\nwe have the exclusive clustering\nwhich is the hard clustering so here and item belongs\nexclusively to one cluster not several clusters\nand the data point.\nAlong exclusively to one cluster.\nSo an example of this is the k-means clustering\nso k-means clustering does this exclusive kind\nof clustering so secondly,\nwe have overlapping clustering\nso it is also known as soft clusters in this\nand item can belong\nto multiple clusters as its degree of association\nwith each cluster is shown and for example,\nwe have fuzzy or the c means clustering\nwhich is being used for overlapping clustering\nand finally we have The hierarchical clustering\nso when two clusters have a parent-child relationship\nor a tree-like structure,\nthen it is known as hierarchical cluster.\nSo as you can see here from the example,\nwe have a parent-child kind\nof relationship in the cluster given here.\nSo let's understand\nwhat exactly is K means clustering.\nSo k-means clustering is an algorithm whose main goal\nis to group similar elements of data points into a cluster\nand it is the process\nby which objects are classified into a predefined number.\nOf groups so that they are as much dissimilar as\npossible from one group to another group\nbut as much as similar or possible within each group now\nif you have a look at the algorithm working here, right?\nSo first of all,\nit starts with and defying the number of clusters,\nwhich is k then I can we find\nthe centroid we find the distance objects\nto the distance object\nto the centroid distance of object to the centroid\nthen we find the Dropping based\non the minimum distance has the centroid Converse\nif true then we make a cluster false.\nWe then I can't find the centroid repeat\nall of the steps again and again,\nso let me show you\nhow exactly clustering was with an example here.\nSo first we need to decide the number\nof clusters to be made now another important task here is\nhow to decide the important number of clusters\nor how to decide the number of clusters really get\ninto that later.\nSo first, let's assume\nthat the number Number of clusters we have decided\nis 3 so after that then we provide the centroids\nfor all the Clusters\nwhich is guessing\nand the algorithm calculates the euclidean distance\nof the point from each centroid\nand assigns the data point\nto the closest cluster now euclidean distance.\nAll of you know is the square root\nof the distance the square root of the square of the distance.\nSo next when the center is a calculated again,\nwe have our new clusters for each data point.\nAnd again the distance from the points\nto the new clusters are calculated and then again,\nthe points are assigned to the closest cluster.\nAnd then again,\nwe have the new centroid\nscattered and now these steps are repeated\nuntil we have a repetition the centroids\nor the new center eyes are very close to the very previous ones.\nSo antenna and less output gets repeated\nor the outputs are very very close enough.\nWe do not stop this process.\nWe keep on calculating the euclidean distance.\nIt's of all the points to the centroids.\nThen we calculate the new centroids\nand that is how clay means clustering Works basically,\nso an important part here is to understand\nhow to decide the value of K or the number of clusters\nbecause it does not make any sense.\nIf you do not know\nhow many classes are you going to make?\nSo to decide the number of clusters,\nwe have the elbow method.\nSo let's assume first\nof all compute the sum squared error,\nwhich is the sse4 some value.\nA for example,\nlet's take two four six and eight now the SS e\nwhich is the sum squared is defined as a sum\nof the squared distance between each number member\nof the cluster\nand its centroid mathematically and\nif you mathematically it is given by the equation\nwhich is provided here.\nAnd if you brought the key against the SSE,\nyou will see that the error decreases\nas K gets large now this is\nbecause the number of cluster increases\nthey should be smaller.\nSo does this torsion is also smaller know the idea\nof the elbow method is to choose the K at which\nthe SSC decreases abruptly.\nSo for example here\nif we have a look at the figure given here.\nWe see that the best number of cluster is at the elbow\nas you can see here the graph here changes abruptly\nafter number four.\nSo for this particular example,\nwe're going to use for as a number of cluster.\nSo first of all while working\nwith k-means clustering there are two key points,\nAs to know first of all be careful about various start.\nSo choosing the first center\nat random choosing the second center\nthat is far away from the first center similarly choosing\nthe NIH Center as far away as possible from the closest\nof the all the other centers\nand the second idea is to do as many runs\nof k-means each with different random starting points\nso that you get an idea of where exactly\nand how many clusters you need to make and\nwhere exactly the centroid lies.\nAnd how the data is getting confused\nnow k-means is not exactly a very good method.\nSo let's understand the pros and cons of clay means clusterings.\nWe know that k-means is simple and understandable.\nEveryone loves you\nthat the first go the items automatically assigned\nto the Clusters.\nNow if we have a look at the cons,\nso first of all one needs to define the number of clusters,\nthere's a very heavy task asks us\nif we have 3/4 or\nif we have 10 categories and if we do not know\nwhat the number of clusters are going to be.\nIt's Difficult for anyone to you know to guess the number\nof clusters not all items are forced into clusters\nwhether they are actually belong to any other cluster\nor any other category,\nthey are forced to to lie\nin that other category in which they are closest\nto this against happens because of the number\nof clusters with not defining the correct number of clusters\nor not being able to guess the correct number of clusters.\nSo and most of all it's unable\nto handle the noisy data and the outliners because anyway,\nAs machine learning engineers\nand data scientists have to clean the data.\nBut then again it comes down\nto the analysis watch they are doing and the method\nthat they are using so typically people do not clean the data\nfor k-means clustering even\nif the clean there's sometimes a now see noisy\nand outliners data which affect the whole model\nso that was all for k-means clustering.\nSo what we're going to do is now use k-means clustering\nfor the We data set\nso we have to find out the number of clusters\nand divide it accordingly.\nSo the use case is that first of all,\nwe have a data set of five thousand movies.\nAnd what you want to do is grip them\nif the movies into clusters based on the Facebook likes,\nso guys, let's have a look at the demo here.\nSo first of all,\nwhat we're going to do is import deep copy numpy pandas\nSeaborn the various libraries,\nwhich we're going to use now and from map popular videos.\nIn the use ply plot,\nand we're going to use this ggplot and next\nwhat we're going to do is import the data set\nand look at the shape of the data is it\nso if we have a look at the shape of the data set we can see\nthat it has 5043 rows with Twenty Eight columns.\nAnd if you have a look\nat the head of the data set we can see it has 5043 data points,\nso What we're going to do is place the data points\nin the plot me take the director Facebook likes\nand we have a look at the data columns face number\nand post cars total\nFacebook likes director Facebook likes.\nSo what we have done here\nnow is taking the director Facebook likes and the actor\nthree Facebook likes, right.\nSo we have five thousand forty three rows\nand two columns Now using the k-means from sklearn\nwhat we're going to do is import it.\nFirst we're going to import k-means\nfrom sklearn dot cluster.\nRemember guys Escalon is a very important library\nin Python for machine learning.\nSo and the number of cluster\nwhat we're going to do is provide as five now this again,\nthe number of cluster depends upon the SSE,\nwhich is the sum of squared errors\nor the we're going to use the elbow method.\nSo I'm not going to go into the details of that again.\nSo we're going to fit the data into the k-means to fit and\nif you find the cluster,\nUs then for the k-means and printed.\nSo what we find is is an array of five clusters\nand Fa print the label of the Caymans cluster.\nNow next what we're going to do is plot the data\nwhich we have with the Clusters with the new data clusters,\nwhich we have found and for this we're going\nto use the si bon and as you can see here,\nwe have plotted that car.\nWe have plotted the data into the grid\nand You can see here.\nWe have five clusters.\nSo probably what I would say is\nthat the cluster 3 and the cluster\nzero are very very close.\nSo it might depend see that's exactly\nwhat I was going to say.\nIs that initially the main Challenge\nand k-means clustering is to define the number of centers\nwhich are the K.\nSo as you can see here\nthat the third Center\nand the zeroth cluster the third cluster\nand the zeroth cluster up very very close to each other\nso It probably could have been in one another cluster\nand the another disadvantage was\nthat we do not exactly know\nhow the points are to be arranged.\nSo it's very difficult to force the data into any other cluster\nwhich makes our analysis a little different works fine.\nBut sometimes it might be difficult to code\nin the k-means clustering now,\nlet's understand what exactly is seems clustering.\nSo the fuzzy c means\nis an extension of the k-means clustering the popular simple.\nClustering technique so fuzzy clustering also referred\nas soft clustering is a form\nof clustering in which each data point can belong\nto more than one cluster.\nSo k-means tries to find the heart clusters\nwhere each point belongs to one cluster.\nWhereas the fuzzy c means discovers the soft clusters\nin a soft cluster any point can belong\nto more than one cluster\nat a time with a certain Affinity value\ntowards each 4zc means assigns the degree of membership,\nwhich Just from 0 to 1 to an object to a given cluster.\nSo there is a stipulation that the sum of the membership\nof an object to all the cluster.\nIt belongs to must be equal to 1 so the degree of membership\nof this particular point to pull of these clusters as 0.6 0.4.\nAnd if you add up we get 1\nso that is one of the logic behind the fuzzy c means\nso and and this Affinity is proportional to the distance\nfrom the point to the center of the cluster now then again\nNow we have the pros and cons of fuzzy see means.\nSo first of all,\nit allows a data point to be in multiple cluster.\nThat's a pro.\nIt's a more neutral representation of the behavior\nof jeans jeans usually are involved in multiple functions.\nSo it is a very good type of clustering\nwhen we're talking about genes First of and again,\nif we talk about the cons again,\nwe have to Define c which is the number\nof clusters same as K next.\nWe need to determine the membership cutoff value also,\nso that takes a lot of Time and it's time-consuming\nand the Clusters\nare sensitive to initial assignment of centroid.\nSo a slight change\nor deviation from the center has it's going to result\nin a very different kind of, you know,\na funny kind of output we get from the fuzzy c means and one\nof the major disadvantage of see means clustering is\nthat it's this are non deterministic algorithm.\nSo it does not give you\na particular output as in such that's\nthat now let's have a look.\nAt the third type\nof clustering which is the hierarchical clustering.\nSo hierarchical clustering is an alternative approach\nwhich builds a hierarchy from the bottom up\nor the top to bottom\nand does not require to specify the number\nof clusters beforehand.\nNow, the algorithm works as in first of all,\nwe put each data point in its own cluster and\nif I the closest to Cluster\nand combine them into one more cluster repeat the above step\ntill the data points are in a single cluster.\nNow, there are two types of hierarchical clustering one is\nI've number 80 plus string\nand the other one is division clustering.\nSo a commemorative clustering bills the dendogram\nfrom bottom level\nwhile the division clustering it starts all the data points\nin one cluster the fruit cluster now again\nhierarchical clustering also has some sort of pros and cons.\nSo in the pros don't know Assumption\nof a particular number of cluster is required\nand it may correspond to meaningful taxonomist.\nWhereas if we talk about the cons\nonce a decision is made to combine two clusters.\nHas it cannot be undone and one\nof the major disadvantage of these hierarchical clustering is\nthat it becomes very slow.\nIf we talked about very very large data sets and nowadays.\nI think every industry are using last year as its and collecting\nlarge amounts of data.\nSo hierarchical clustering is not the act\nor the best method someone might need to go for so there's\nthat now when we talk about unsupervised learning,\nso we have K means clustering and again,\nAnother important term\nwhich people usually Miss while talking about us was running and\nthere's one very important concept\nof Market Basket analysis.\nNow, it is one of the key techniques\nused by large retailers to uncover association\nbetween items now it works by looking\nfor combination of items\nthat occur together frequently\nin the transactions to put it in other way.\nIt allows retailers to identify the relationships\nbetween the items\nthat the People by for example people\nwho buy bread also tend to buy butter the marketing team\nat the retail stores should Target customers\nwho buy bread and butter and provide them and offer\nso that they buy a third item like an egg.\nSo if a customer buys bread and butter and sees a discount\nor an offer on X,\nhe will be encouraged to spend more money and buy the eggs.\nNow, this is what Market Basket analysis is all about now\nto find the association between the two items\nand make predictions about what the customers will buy.\nThere are two Cartoons which are the association rule Mining\nand the ebrary algorithms.\nSo let's discuss each of these algorithm\nwith an example.\nFirst of all,\nif we have a look at the association rule mining now,\nit's a technique that's shows\nhow items are associated to each other for example customers\nwho purchased spread have a 60 percent likelihood\nof also purchasing jam and customers\nwho purchase laptop are more likely to purchase laptop bags.\nNow if you take an example of an association rule\nif we have a look at the Example here a arrow B.\nIt means that\nif a person buys an atom a then he will also buy an atom P. Now.\nThere are three common ways to measure a particular Association\nbecause we have to find these rules not on the basis\nof some statistics, right?\nSo what we do is use\nsupport confidence and lift now these three common ways\nand the measures to have a look\nat the association rule Mining and know exactly\nhow good is that rule.\nSo first of all,\nwe have support So support gifts the fraction of the\nWhich contains an item A and B.\nSo it's basically the frequency of the item\nin the whole item set.\nWhere's confidence gifts\nhow often the item A and B occurred together\ngiven the number of item given the number\nof times a occur.\nSo it's frequency a comma B divided by\nthe frequency of a now left\nwhat indicates is the strength of the rule over the random\nco-occurrence of A and B.\nIf you have a close look at the denominator\nof the lift formula here,\nwe have support a into support be and now a major thing\nwhich can be noted from this is\nthat the support of A and B are independent here.\nSo if the value of lift\nor the denominator value of the lift is more it means\nthat the items are independently selling more not together.\nSo that in turn will decrease the value of lift.\nSo what happens is\nthat suppose the value of lift is more that implies\nthat the rule which we get.\nIt implies that the rule is strong and it\nAnd we used for later purposes because in that case the support\nin to support P value,\nwhich is the denominator of lift will be low\nwhich in turn means\nthat there is a relationship between the items in the and B.\nSo let's take an example of Association rule Mining\nand understand how exactly it works.\nSo let's suppose we have a set of items a b c d\nand e and we have the set of transactions\nwhich are T1 T2,\nT3, T4 and T5\nand what we need to do is create some sort of Rules,\nfor example, you can see a d\nwhich means that if a person buys a he buys D\nif a person by see he buys a if a person buys a he by C.\nAnd for the fourth one is\nif a person by B and C Hill in turn by a now\nwhat we need to do is calculate the support confidence and lift\nof these rules now here again,\nwe talked about a priority algorithm.\nSo a priori algorithm\nand the association rule mining go hand in hand.\nSo what a predator This algorithm.\nIt uses the frequent itemsets to generate the association rules\nand it is based on the concept\nthat a subset\nof a frequent itemsets must also be a frequent Isom set.\nSo let's understand\nwhat is a frequent item set and how all of these work together.\nSo if we take the following transactions of items,\nwe have transaction T 1 2 T 5 and the items are 1 3 4\n2 3 5 1 2 3 5 2 5 and 1 3 5 now.\nNow another more important thing about support\nwhich I forgot to mention was\nthat when talking\nabout Association rule mining there is a minimum support count\nwhat we need to do.\nNow.\nThe first step is to build a list of items\nthat of size 1 using this transaction data\nset and use the minimum support count to now,\nlet's see how we do that if we create the table see\nwhen you have a close look at the table c 1\nwe have the items at one which has support three\nbecause it appears in the transaction one.\nThree and five similarly\nif you have a look at the item set the single item 3.\nSo it has the support of for it appears\nin t 1 T 2 T 3 and T 5 but\nif we have a look at the item set for it only appears\nin the transaction once\nso it's support value is 1 now the item set with\nthe support value Which is less than the minimum support value\nthat is to have to be eliminated.\nSo the final table\nwhich is a table F1 has one two three.\nAnd five it does not contain the for now.\nWhat we're going to do is create the item list of the size\n2 and all the combination of the item sets in F1.\nI used in this iteration.\nSo we're left for behind.\nWe just have 1 2 3 &amp; 5.\nSo the possible item sets a 1 2 1 3\n1 5 2 3 2 5 &amp; 3 5 then again.\nWe will calculate the support So\nin this case if we have a closer look at the table\nc 2 we see that the items at once.\nWhat to do is having\na support value 1 which has to be eliminated.\nSo the final table f 2 does not contain 1 comma 2 similarly\nif we create the item sets\nof size 3 and calculate this support values,\nbut before calculating the support, let's perform\nthe puring on the data set.\nNow what's appearing?\nSo after all the combinations are made we divide the table\nc 3 items to check\nif there are another subset whose support is less\nthan the minimum support value.\nThis is a prairie algorithm.\nSo in the item sets one, two,\nthree what we can see that we have one two,\nand in the one to five again,\nwe have one too so build this cardboard of these item sets\nand we'll be left with 1 3 5 and 2 3 5.\nSo with one three five,\nwe have three subsets one five one, three three five,\nwhich are present in table F2.\nThen again.\nWe have two three to five and 3/5\nwhich are also present in t will f 2\nso we have 2 Move 1 comma 2 from the table c\n3 and create the table F3 now\nif you're using the items of C3 to create the atoms of C-4.\nSo what we find is\nthat we have the item set 1 2 3 5 the support value is\n1 Which is less than the minimum support value of 2.\nSo what we're going to do is stop here\nand we're going to return to the previous item set.\nThat is the table c 3 so the final table.\nWell, if three was one three five with\nthe support value of 2 and 2 3 5 with the support value of 2 now,\nwhat we're gonna do is generate all the subsets\nof each frequent itemsets.\nSo let's assume\nthat minimum confidence value is 60% So for every subset s\nof I the output rule is that s gives i2s\nis that s recommends i ns.\nIf the support of I / support of s is greater than or equal.\nEqual to the minimum confidence value,\nthen only will proceed further.\nSo keep in mind\nthat we have not used left till now.\nWe are only working with support and confidence.\nSo applying rules with item sets of F3\nwe get rule 1 which is 1 comma 3 which gives 1 3 5 and 1/3.\nIt means if you buy one and three there's a 66% chance\nthat you will buy item 5 also\nsimilarly the rule 1 comma 5 it means\nthat If you buy one and five,\nthere's a hundred percent chance\nthat you will buy three also similarly\nif we have a look at Rule 5 and 6 here\nthe confidence value is\nless than 60 percent which was the assumed confidence value.\nSo what we're going to do is with reject these files now\nan important thing to note here is\nthat have a closer look to the Rule 5 and root 3,\nyou see it has one five three one five three three point five.\nIt's very confusing.\nSo one thing to keep in Mine is\nthat the order of the item sets is also very important\nthat will help us allow create good rules\nand avoid any kind of confusion.\nSo that's that.\nSo now let's learn\nhow Association rule I used in Market Basket analysis problems.\nSo what we'll do is we will be using\nthe online transactions data\nof a retail store for generating Association rules.\nSo first of all,\nwhat you need to do is import pandas MSD ml.\nD&amp;D libraries from the imported and read the data.\nSo first of all, what we're going to do is read the data,\nwhat we're going to do is from M LX T\nand E dot frequent patterns.\nWe're going to improve the a priori and Association rules.\nAs you can see here.\nWe have the head of the data.\nYou can see we have invoice number stock code\nthe description quantity\nthe invoice dt8 unit price customer ID and the country.\nSo in the next step,\nwhat we will do is we will do the data cleanup\nwhich includes removing.\nHis from some of the descriptions given\nand what we're going to do is drop the rules\nthat do not have\nthe invoice numbers every move the crate transactions.\nSo hey, what what you're going to do is remove\nwhich do not have any invoice number\nif the string tight\nainst Epstein was a number then we're going to remove that.\nThose are the credits remove any kind of spaces\nfrom the descriptions.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have like five hundred and thirty-two thousand rows\nwith eight columns.\nSo next one.\nWe're going to do is after the cleanup.\nWe need to consolidate the items into one transaction per row\nwith each product for the sake of keeping the data set small.\nWe're going to only look at the sales for France.\nSo we're going to use the only France and group\nby invoice number description\nwith the quantity sum up and see so\nwhich leaves us with three ninety two rows\nand one thousand five hundred sixty three columns.\nNow, there are a lot of zeros in the data,\nbut we also need to make sure Any positive values\nare converted to a 1 and anything less than 0 is set to 0\nso for that we're going to use this code defining\nand code units\nif x is less than 0 return 0 if x\nis greater than 1 returned one.\nSo what we're going to do is map\nand apply it to the whole data set we have here.\nSo now that we have structured data properly.\nSo the next step is to generate the frequent item set\nthat has support of at least seven percent.\nNow this number is chosen so that you can get close enough.\nNow, what we're going to do is generate the rules\nwith the corresponding support confidence and lift.\nSo we had given the minimum support a 0.7.\nThe metric is left frequent Island set\nand threshold is 1 so these are\nthe following rules now a few rules with a high lift value,\nwhich means that it occurs more frequently\nthan would be expected given the number of transaction\nthe product combinations most of the places the confidence.\nIs high as well.\nSo these are few to observations what we get here.\nIf we filter the data frame using the standard pandas code\nfor large lift six and high confidence 0.8.\nThis is what the output is going to look like.\nThese are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have the H rules which are the final rules\nwhich are given by the Association rule Mining\nand this is how all the industries are.\nAre any of these we've talked about largely retailers.\nThey tend to know\nhow their products are used and how exactly they\nshould rearrange and provide the offers on the product\nso that people spend more and more money\nand time in the shop.\nSo that was all about Association rule mining.\nSo so guys,\nthat's all for unsupervised learning.\nI hope you got to know about the different formulas\nhow unsupervised learning works because you know,\nwe did not provide any label to the data.\nAll we did was create some rules and not knowing what the data is\nand we did clusterings different types of clusterings\ncame in simi's hierarchical clustering.\nThe reinforcement learning is a part of machine learning\nwhere an agent is put in an environment\nand he learns to behave in this environment\nby performing certain actions.\nOkay, so it basically performs actions and it either gets\na rewards on the actions\nor It gets a punishment and observing the reward\nwhich it gets from those actions reinforcement learning is all\nabout taking an appropriate action in order\nto maximize the reward in a particular situation.\nSo guys in supervised learning the training data comprises\nof the input\nand the expected output\nand so the model is trained with the expected output itself,\nbut when it comes to reinforcement learning,\nthere is no expected output here the reinforcement agent decides.\nWhat actions to take in order to perform a given task.\nIn the absence of a training data set it is bound to learn\nfrom its experience itself.\nAll right.\nSo reinforcement learning is all about an agent\nwho's put in an unknown environment\nand he's going to use a hit and trial method in order\nto figure out the environment\nand then come up with an outcome.\nOkay.\nNow, let's look at reinforcement learning\nwithin an analogy.\nSo consider a scenario where in a baby is learning\nhow to walk the scenario can go about in two ways.\nNow in the first case the baby starts walking\nand makes it to the candy here.\nThe candy is basically the reward it's going to get so\nsince the candy is the end goal.\nThe baby is happy.\nIt's positive.\nOkay, so the baby is happy and it gets rewarded a set\nof candies now another way in which this could go is\nthat the baby starts walking\nbut Falls due to some hurdle in between the baby gets hurt\nand it doesn't get any candy and obviously the baby is sad.\nSo this is a negative reward.\nOkay, or you can say this is a setback.\nSo just like how we humans learn\nfrom our mistakes by trial and error.\nLearning is also similar.\nOkay, so we have an agent\nwhich is basically the baby and a reward\nwhich is the candy over here.\nOkay, and with many hurdles in between the agent is supposed\nto find the best possible path to read through the reward.\nSo guys, I hope you all are clear\nwith the reinforcement learning.\nNow.\nLet's look at the reinforcement learning process.\nSo generally a reinforcement learning system has\ntwo main components.\nAll right, the first is an agent and the second one is\nan environment now in the previous case,\nwe saw that the agent was a baby.\nB and the environment was the living room\nwhere in the baby was crawling.\nOkay.\nThe environment is the setting\nthat the agent is acting on and the agent over here\nrepresents the reinforcement learning algorithm.\nSo guys the reinforcement learning process starts\nwhen the environment sends a state to the agent\nand then the agent will take some actions based\non the observations\nin turn the environment will send the next state\nand the respective reward back to the agent.\nThe agent will update\nits knowledge with the reward returned by the I meant\nand it uses that to evaluate its previous action.\nSo guys this Loop keeps continuing\nuntil the environment sends a terminal state which means\nthat the agent has accomplished all his tasks\nand he finally gets the reward.\nOkay.\nThis is exactly\nwhat was depicted in this scenario.\nSo the agent keeps climbing up ladders\nuntil he reaches his reward to understand this better.\nLet's suppose that our agent is learning to play Counter-Strike.\nOkay, so let's break it down now initially the RL agent\nwhich is Only the player player 1 let's say it's the player\n1 who is trying to learn how to play the game.\nOkay.\nHe collects some state from the environment.\nOkay.\nThis could be the first state of Counter-Strike now based\non the state the agent will take some action.\nOkay, and this action can be anything\nthat causes a result.\nSo if the player moves left\nor right it's also considered as an action.\nOkay.\nSo initially the action is going to be random\nbecause obviously the first time you pick up Counter-Strike,\nyou're not going to be a master at it.\nSo you're going to try with different actions\nand you're just going to Up a random action\nin the beginning.\nNow the environment is going to give a new state.\nSo after clearing\nthat the environment is now going to give a new state\nto the agent or to the player.\nSo maybe he's across stage 1 now.\nHe's in stage 2.\nSo now the player\nwill get a reward our one from the environment\nbecause it cleared stage 1.\nSo this reward can be anything.\nIt can be additional points or coins or anything like that.\nOkay.\nSo basically this Loop keeps going on\nuntil the player is dead or reaches the destination.\nOkay, and it Continuously outputs a sequence\nof States actions and rewards.\nSo guys.\nThis was a small example to show\nyou how reinforcement learning process works.\nSo you start with an initial State\nand once a player clothes that state he gets a reward\nafter that the environment will give another stage to the player\nand after it clears that state it's going to get another reward\nand it's going to keep happening\nuntil the player reaches his destination.\nAll right, so guys, I hope this is clear now,\nlet's move on and look\nat the reinforcement learning definition.\nSo there are a few Concepts that you should be aware\nof while studying reinforcement learning.\nLet's look at those definitions over here.\nSo first we have the agent now an agent is basically\nthe reinforcement learning algorithm that learns\nfrom trial and error.\nOkay.\nSo an agent takes actions,\nlike for example a soldier in Counter-Strike navigating\nthrough the game.\nThat's also an action.\nOkay, if he moves left right or if he shoots at somebody\nthat's also an action.\nOkay.\nSo the agent is responsible\nfor taking actions in the environment.\nNow the environment is the whole Counter-Strike game.\nOkay.\nIt's basically the world through which the agent\nmoves the environment takes the agents current state\nand action as input\nand it Returns the agency reward and its next state as output.\nAlright, next we have action now all the possible steps\nthat an agent can take are called actions.\nSo like I said,\nit can be moving right left or shooting or any of that.\nAlright, then we have state now state is\nbasically the current condition returned by the environment.\nSo Double State you are in\nif you are in state 1 or if you're interested\nto that represents your current condition.\nAll right.\nNext we have reward a reward is basically an instant return\nfrom the environment to appraise Your Last Action.\nOkay, so it can be anything like coins\nor it can be additional points.\nSo basically a reward is given to an agent\nafter it clears.\nThe specific stages.\nNext we have policy policy is basically the strategy\nthat the agent uses to find out his next action.\nIn based on his current state policy is just\nthe strategy with which you approach the game.\nThen we have value.\nNow while you is the expected long-term return with discount\nso value and action value can be a little bit confusing\nfor you right now.\nBut as we move further,\nyou'll understand what I'm talking about.\nOkay, so value is basically the long-term return\nthat you get with discount.\nOkay discount, I'll explain in the further slides.\nThen we have action value\nnow action value is also known as Q value.\nOkay, it's very similar to what You except\nthat it takes an extra parameter,\nwhich is the current action.\nSo basically here you'll find out the Q value depending\non the particular action that you took.\nAll right.\nSo guys don't get confused with value and action value.\nWe look at examples\nin the further slides and you will understand this better.\nOkay, so guys make sure\nthat you're familiar with these terms\nbecause you'll be seeing a lot of these terms\nin the further slides.\nAll right.\nNow before we move any further,\nI'd like to discuss a few more Concepts.\nOkay.\nSo first we will discuss the reward maximization.\nSo if you haven't already realize the it the basic aim\nof the RL agent is to maximize the reward now,\nhow does that happen?\nLet's try to understand this in depth.\nSo the agent must be trained in such a way\nthat he takes the best action so that the reward is maximum\nbecause the end goal of reinforcement learning\nis to maximize your reward based on a set of actions.\nSo let me explain this with a small game now\nin the figure you can see there is a Forks there's some meat\nand there's a tiger So odd agent is basically the fox\nand his end goal is to eat the maximum amount of meat\nbefore being eaten by the tiger now\nsince the fox is a clever fellow\nhe eats the meat\nthat is closer to him rather than the meat\nwhich is closer to the tiger.\nNow this is because the closer he is to the tiger\nthe higher are his chances of getting killed.\nSo because of this the rewards which are near the tiger,\neven if they are bigger meat chunks,\nthey will be discounted.\nSo this is exactly what discounting means\nso our agent is not going to eat the meat chunks\nwhich are Closer to the tiger because of the risk.\nAll right now even\nthough the meat chunks might be larger.\nHe does not want to take the chances of getting killed.\nOkay.\nThis is called discounting.\nOkay.\nThis is where you discount\nbecause it improvised and you just eat the meat\nwhich are closer to you instead of taking risks\nand eating the meat\nwhich are closer to your opponent.\nAll right.\nNow the discounting of reward Works based\non a value called gamma will be discussing gamma\nin our further slides,\nbut in short the value of gamma is between 0 and 1.\nOkay.\nSo the Follow the gamma.\nThe larger is the discount value.\nOkay.\nSo if the gamma value is lesser,\nit means that the agent is not going to explore\nand he's not going to try and eat the meat chunks\nwhich are closer to the tiger.\nOkay, but if the gamma value is closer to 1 it means\nthat our agent is actually going to explore\nand it's going to dry and eat the meat chunks\nwhich are closer to the tiger.\nAll right now,\nI'll be explaining this in depth in the further slides.\nSo don't worry\nif you haven't got a clear concept yet,\nbut just understand that reward maximized.\nAtion is a very important step\nwhen it comes to reinforcement learning\nbecause the agent has to collect maximum rewards\nby the end of the game.\nAll right.\nNow, let's look at another concept\nwhich is called exploration and exploitation.\nSo exploration like the name suggests is about exploring\nand capturing more information about an environment\non the other hand exploitation is about using the already\nknown exploited information to hide in the rewards.\nSo guys consider the fox and tiger example\nthat we discussed now here\nthe foxy Only the meat chunks which are close to him,\nbut he does not eat the meat chunks\nwhich are closer to the tiger.\nOkay, even though they might give him more Awards.\nHe does not eat them\nif the fox only focuses on the closest rewards,\nhe will never reach the big chunks of meat.\nOkay, this is what exploitation is\nabout you just going to use the currently known information\nand you're going to try and get rewards based\non that information.\nBut if the fox decides to explore a bit,\nit can find the bigger award which is the big chunks of meat.\nThis is exactly what exploration is.\nSo the agent is not going to stick to one corner instead.\nHe's going to explore the entire environment and try\nand collect bigger rewards.\nAll right, so guys,\nI hope you all are clear with exploration and exploitation.\nNow, let's look at the markers decision process.\nSo guys, this is basically a mathematical approach\nfor mapping a solution in reinforcement learning in a way.\nThe purpose of reinforcement learning is to solve\na Markov decision process.\nOkay, so there are a few parameters.\nWas that I used to get to the solution.\nSo the parameters include the set of actions the set\nof states the rewards the policy\nthat you're taking to approach the problem and the value\nthat you get.\nOkay, so to sum it up the agent must take\nan action a to transition\nfrom a start state to the end State s\nwhile doing so the agent will receive a reward are\nfor each action that he takes.\nSo guys a series\nof actions taken by the agent Define the policy\nor a defines the approach.\nAnd the rewards\nthat are collected Define the value.\nSo the main goal here is to maximize the rewards\nby choosing the optimum policy.\nAll right.\nNow, let's try to understand this with the help\nof the shortest path problem.\nI'm sure a lot of you might have gone through this problem\nwhen you are in college,\nso guys look at the graph over here.\nSo our aim here is to find the shortest path\nbetween a and d with minimum possible cost.\nSo the value that you see on each of these edges\nbasically denotes the cost.\nSo if I want to go from A to see it's gonna cost me 15 points.\nOkay.\nSo let's look at how this is done.\nNow before we move and look at the problem\nin this problem the set of states are denoted by the nodes,\nwhich is ABCD\nand the action is to Traverse from one node to the other.\nSo if I'm going from A to B,\nthat's an action similarly a to see\nthat's an action.\nOkay, the reward is basically the cost\nwhich is represented by each Edge over here.\nAll right.\nNow the policy is basically the path that I choose\nto reach the destination,\nso Let's say I choose a seed be okay,\nthat's one policy in order to get to D\nand choosing a CD which is a policy.\nOkay.\nIt's basically how I'm approaching the problem.\nSo guys here you can start off at node a\nand you can take baby steps to your destination.\nNow initially you're clueless\nso you can just take the next possible node,\nwhich is visible to you.\nSo guys, if you're smart enough,\nyou're going to choose a to see instead of ABCD or ABD.\nAll right.\nSo now if you are at nodes see you want to drive.\nString note D.\nYou must again choose a weisbarth.\nAll right, you just have to calculate which path has\nthe highest cost\nor which path will give you the maximum rewards.\nSo guys, this is a simple problem.\nWe just trying to calculate the shortest path between a\nand d by traversing through these nodes.\nSo if I Traverse from a CD, it gives me the maximum reward.\nOkay, it gives me 65,\nwhich is more than any other policy would give me.\nOkay.\nSo if I go from ABD,\nit would be 40 when you compare this to a CD.\nIt gives me more reward.\nSo obviously I'm going to go with a CB.\nOkay, so guys was a simple problem\nin order to understand how Markov decision process works.\nAll right, so guys, I want to ask you a question.\nWhat do you think?\nI did hear did I perform exploration or did I\nperform exploitation now\nthe policy for the above example is of exploitation\nbecause we didn't explore the other nodes.\nOkay.\nWe just selected three notes and we travel through them.\nSo that's why this is called exploitation.\nWe must always explore the different notes\nso that we Find a more optimal policy.\nBut in this case,\nobviously a CD has the highest reward\nand we're going with a CD but generally it's not so simple.\nThere are a lot of nodes there hundreds of notes you Traverse\nand there are like 50 60 policies.\nOkay, 50 60 different policies.\nSo you make sure you explore through all the policies\nand then decide on an Optimum policy\nwhich will give you a maximum reward the for a robot\nand environment is a place\nwhere It has been put to use now.\nRemember this reward is itself\nthe agent for example an automobile Factory\nwhere a robot is used to move materials\nfrom one place to another now the task we discussed just\nnow have a property in common.\nNow, these tasks involve and environment and expect\nthe agent to learn from the environment.\nNow, this is where traditional machine learning phase\nand hence the need for reinforcement learning now.\nIt is good to have an established overview\nof the problem.\nThat is to be Of using the Q learning\nor the reinforcement learning\nso it helps to define the main components\nof a reinforcement learning solution.\nThat is the agent environment action rewards and States.\nSo let's suppose we are to build\na few autonomous robots for an automobile building Factory.\nNow, these robots will help the factory personal\nby conveying them the necessary parts\nthat they would need in order to pull the car.\nNow.\nThese different parts are located at\nnine different positions within the factory warehouse.\nThe car part include the chassis Wheels dashboard\nthe engine and so on\nand the factory workers have prioritized the location\nthat contains the body\nor the chassis to be the topmost but they\nhave provided the priorities for other locations as well,\nwhich will look into the moment.\nNow these locations\nwithin the factory look somewhat like this.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have L1 L2 L3\nall of these stations now one thing you might notice here\nthat there Little obstacle prison in between the locations.\nSo L6 is the top priority location\nthat contains the chassis for preparing the car bodies.\nNow the task is to enable the robots\nso that they can find the shortest route\nfrom any given location to another location on their own.\nNow the agents in this case are the robots the environment\nis the automobile Factory warehouse.\nSo let's talk about the state's the states are the location\nin which a particular robot is\nAnd in the particular instance of time,\nwhich will denote it states the machines understand numbers\nrather than let us so let's map the location codes to number.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have mapped location l 1 to this t 0 L 2 and 1\nand so on we have L8 as state 7 and L line at state.\nSo next what we're going to talk about are the actions.\nSo in our example,\nthe action will be the direct location\nthat a robot can go\nfrom a particular location right considering What\nthat is a tel to location\nand the Direct locations to which it can move rl5 L1 and L3.\nNow the figure here may come in handy to visualize this now\nas you might have already guessed the set of actions\nhere is nothing but the set\nof all possible states\nof the robot for each location the set of actions\nthat a robot can take will be different.\nFor example, the set of actions will change\nif the robot is in L1 rather than L2.\nSo if the robot is Is in L1 it can only go\nto L 4 and L 2 directly now\nthat we are done with the states and the actions.\nLet's talk about the rewards.\nSo the states are basically zero one two,\nthree four and the actions are also 0 1\n2 3 4 up to 8.\nNow.\nThe rewards now will be given to a robot.\nIf a location\nwhich is the state is directly reachable\nfrom a particular location.\nSo let's take an example suppose L line is directly reachable\nfrom L8, right?\nIf a robot goes from LA to align and vice versa,\nit will be rewarded by one and\nif I look a shin is not directly reachable\nfrom a particular equation.\nWe do not give any reward a reward of 0 now the reward\nis just a number\nand nothing else it enables the robots to make sense\nof the movements helping them\nin deciding what locations are directly reachable\nand what are not now\nwith this Q. We can construct a reward table\nwhich contains all the required values mapping\nbetween all possible States.\nSo as you can see here in the table the positions\nwhich are marked green have a positive reward.\nAnd as you can see here,\nwe have all the possible rewards that a robot can get by moving\nin between the different states.\nNow comes an interesting decision.\nNow remember that the factory administrator prioritized L6\nto be the topmost.\nSo how do we incorporate this fact in the above table.\nNow, this is done by associating the topmost priority location\nwith a very high reward than the usual ones.\nSo let's put 990.\nAnd in the cell L 6 comma\nand 6 now the table of rewards with a higher reward\nfor the topmost location looks something like this.\nWe have not formally defined all the vital components\nfor the solution.\nWe are aiming for the problem discussed.\nNow, you will shift gears a bit and study some\nof the fundamental concepts\nthat Prevail in the world of reinforcement learning\nand q-learning the first of all we'll start\nwith the Bellman equation now consider\nthe following Square rooms,\nwhich is analogous to the actual environment.\nAunt from our original problem,\nbut without the barriers now suppose a robot needs to go\nto the room marked\nin the green promise current position a using\nthe specified Direction now,\nhow can we enable the robot to do this programmatically\none idea would be introduced some kind of a footprint\nwhich the robot will be able to follow now here\na constant value is specified in each of the rooms\nwhich will come along the robots way\nif it follows the direction specified above now in this way\nif it starts at A it will be able to scan\nthrough this constant value\nand will move accordingly but this will only work\nif the direction is prefix\nand the robot always starts\nat the location a now consider the robot starts\nat this location rather than its previous one.\nNow the robot now sees Footprints\nin two different directions.\nIt is therefore unable to decide which way to go\nin order to get the destination which is the Green Room.\nIt happens primarily\nbecause the robot does not have a weight.\nRemember the directions to proceed so our job\nnow is to enable the robot with a memory.\nNow, this is where the Bellman equation comes into play.\nSo as you can see here,\nthe main reason of the Bellman equation\nis to enable the reward with the memory.\nThat's the thing we're going to use.\nSo the equation goes something like this V\nof s gives maximum a r of s comma a plus gamma of vs -\nwhere s is a particular state\nwhich is a ROM a is the Action Moving\nbetween the rooms as -\nis the state to which the robot goes from s\nand gamma is the discount Factor\nnow we'll get into it in a moment\nand obviously R of s comma a is a reward function\nwhich takes a state as an action a and outputs the reward now V\nof s is the value of being in a particular state\nwhich is the footprint\nnow we consider all the possible actions\nand take the one that yields the maximum value now,\nthere is one constraint however regarding the value Footprint,\nthat is the row marked\nin the yellow just below the Green Room.\nIt will always have the value of 1 to denote\nthat is one of the nearest room\nadjacent to the Green Room not this is also to ensure\nthat a robot gets a reward\nwhen it goes from a yellow room to The Green Room.\nLet's see how to make sense of the equation\nwhich we have here.\nSo let's assume a discount factor of 0.9\nas remember gamma is the discount value\nor the discount Factor.\nSo let's take a 0.9 now for the room,\nwhich is Just below the one\nor the yellow room, which is the Aztec Mark for this room.\nWhat will be the V of s\nthat is the value of being in a particular state?\nSo for this V of s would be something\nlike maximum of a will take 0\nwhich is the initial of our s comma.\nHey plus 0.9 which is gamma into 1\nthat gives us zero point nine now here the robot\nwill not get any reward\nfor going to a state marked in yellow.\nHence the ER s comma a is 0 here\nbut the robot knows the value of being in the yellow room.\nHence V of s Dash is one following this\nfor the other states.\nWe should get 0.9 then again,\nif we put 0.9 in this equation,\nwe get 0.81 than 0.7 to 9 and then we again reach\nthe starting point.\nSo this is\nhow the table looks with some value Footprints computed\nfrom the Bellman equation now a couple of things\nto It is here is\nthat the max function has the robot to always\nchoose the state\nthat gives it the maximum value of being in that state.\nNow the discount Factor gamma notifies the robot\nabout how far it is from the destination.\nThis is typically specified by the developer of the algorithm.\nThat would be installed in the robot.\nNow, the other states can also be given their respective values\nin a similar way.\nSo as you can see here the boxes adjacent\nto the green one have one and\nif we Move away from 1 we get 0.9 0.8 1 0 1 7 to 9\nand finally we reach 0.66.\nNow the robot now can precede its way\nthrough the Green Room utilizing these value Footprints event\nif it's dropped at any arbitrary room\nin the given location now,\nif a robot Lance up in the highlighted Sky Blue Area,\nit will still find two options to choose\nfrom but eventually either of the parts will be good enough\nfor the robot to take\nbecause Auto V the value for prints\nand only that out.\nNow one thing to note is\nthat the Bellman equation is one of the key equations\nin the world of reinforcement learning and Q learning.\nSo if we think realistically our surroundings do not always work\nin the way we expect there is always a bit\nof stochastic City involved in it.\nSo this applies to robot as well.\nSometimes it might so happen\nthat the robots Machinery got corrupted.\nSometimes the robot may come across some hindrance\non its way which it may not be known\nto it beforehand.\nRight and sometimes even if the robot knows\nthat it needs to take the right turn it will not so\nhow do we introduce this to cast a city\nin our case now here comes the Markov decision process.\nSo consider the robot is currently in the Red Room\nand it needs to go to the green room.\nNow.\nLet's now consider the robot has a slight chance\nof dysfunctioning and might take the left or the right\nor the bottom turn instead of digging the upper turn\nand are Get to the Green Room from where it is now,\nwhich is the Retro.\nNow the question is,\nhow do we enable the robot to handle this when it is out\nin the given environment right.\nNow, this is a situation\nwhere the decision making\nregarding which turn is to be taken is partly random\nand partly another control of the robot now partly random\nbecause we are not sure\nwhen exactly the robot mind dysfunctional and partly under\nthe control of the robot\nbecause it is still\nmaking a decision of taking a turn right on its own.\nAnd with the help of the program embedded into it.\nSo a Markov decision process\nis a discrete time stochastic Control process.\nIt provides a mathematical framework for modeling\ndecision-making in situations\nwhere the outcomes are partly random\nand partly under the control of the decision maker.\nNow we need to give this concept\na mathematical shape most likely an equation\nwhich then can be taken further.\nNow you might be surprised\nthat we can do this with the help of the Bellman equation.\nAction with a few minor tweaks.\nSo if we have a look at the original Bellman equation\nV of X is equal\nto maximum of our s comma a plus gamma V of s -\nwhat needs to be changed in the above equation\nso that we can introduce some amount of Randomness\nhere as long as we are not sure\nwhen the robot might not take the expected turn.\nWe are then also not sure in which room it might end up\nin which is nothing\nbut the ROM it moves\nfrom its current room at this point according.\nTo the equation.\nWe are not sure of the a stash\nwhich is the next state or the room,\nbut we do know all the probable turns the robot might take now\nin order to incorporate each\nof this probabilities into the above equation.\nWe need to associate a probability with each\nof the turns to quantify the robot.\nIf it has got any expertise chance of taking the stern know\nif we do so we get PS is equal to maximum\nof RS comma a plus gamma into summation of s -\nPS comma a comma s stash into V of his stash now the PS a--\nand a stash is the probability\nof moving from room s to establish with the action a\nand the submission here is the expectation\nof the situation.\nThat's a robot in curse,\nwhich is the randomness now, let's take a look\nat this example here.\nSo when we associate\nthe probabilities to each of these terms Owns,\nwe essentially mean that there is an 80% chance\nthat the robot will take the upper turn.\nNow, if you put all the required values\nin our equation,\nwe get V of s is equal to maximum of R of s comma a +\ncomma of 0.8 into V of room up\nplus zero point 1 into V of room down 0.03 into Rome\nof V of from left plus 0.03 into V of room right now note\nthat the value footprints.\nNot change due to the fact\nthat we are incorporating stochastically here.\nBut this time we will not calculate\nthose values Footprints instead.\nWe will let the robot to figure it out.\nNow up until this point.\nWe have not considered about rewarding the robot\nfor its action of going into a particular room.\nWe are only watering the robot\nwhen it gets to the destination now,\nideally there should be a reward for each action the robot takes\nto help it better assess the quality of the actions,\nbut the there was need not to be always be the same\nbut it is much better than having some amount\nof reward for the actions than having no rewards at all.\nRight and this idea is known as the living penalty in reality.\nThe reward system can be very complex\nand particularly modeling sparse rewards is an active area\nof research in the domain of reinforcement learning.\nSo by now we have got the equation which we have a so\nwhat we're going to do is now transition to Q learning.\nSo this equation gives us the value of going\nto a particular State taking the stochastic city\nof the environment into account.\nNow, we have also learned very briefly about the idea\nof living penalty\nwhich deals with associating each move of the robot\nwith a reward.\nSo Q learning processes\nand idea of assessing the quality of an action\nthat is taken to move to a state rather than determining\nthe possible value of the state\nwhich is being moved to so earlier.\nWe had 0.8 into V. E of s 1 0.03 into V\nof S 2 0 point 1 into V of S 3 and so on now\nif you incorporate the idea of assessing the quality\nof the action for moving to a certain state\nso the environment with the agent\nand the quality of the action will look something like this.\nSo instead of 0.8 V\nof s 1 will have q of s 1 comma a one will have q\nof S 2 comma 2 Q of S 3 now the robot now has food.\nIn states to choose from and along with that there are\nfour different actions also for the current state it is in so\nhow do we calculate Q of s comma\na that is the cumulative quality of the possible actions\nthe robot might take so let's break it down.\nNow from the equation V of s equals maximum a RS comma a +\ncomma summation s - PSAs - into V of s -\nif we discard them.\nMaximum function we have is of a plus gamma into summation p\nand v now essentially in the equation\nthat produces V of s.\nWe are considering all possible actions\nand all possible States from the current state\nthat the robot is\nin and then we are taking\nthe maximum value caused by taking a certain action\nand the equation produces a value footprint,\nwhich is for just one possible action.\nIn fact, we can think of it as the quality\nof the So Q of s comma a is equal to RS comma a +\ncomma of summation p and v now\nthat we have got an equation to quantify the quality\nof a particular action.\nWe are going to make a little adjustment\nin the equation we can now say\nthat V of s is the maximum of all the possible values\nof Q of s comma a right.\nSo let's utilize this fact\nand replace V of s Dash as a function of Q. So Q U.s.\nComma a becomes R of s comma a + comma of summation PSAs -\nand maximum of the que\nes - a -\nso the equation of V is now turned into an equation of Q,\nwhich is the quality.\nBut why would we do that now?\nThis is done to ease our calculations\nbecause now we have only one function Q\nwhich is also the core of the dynamic programming language.\nWe have only one.\nOcean Q to calculate\nand R of s comma a is a Quantified metric\nwhich produces reward of moving to a certain State.\nNow, the qualities\nof the actions are called The Q values\nand from now on we will refer to the value Footprints\nas the Q values an important piece\nof the puzzle is the temporal difference.\nNow temporal difference is the component\nthat will help the robot calculate the Q values\nwhich respect to the changes in the environment over time.\nSo consider Our robot is currently in the mark State\nand it wants to move to the Upper State.\nOne thing to note that here is\nthat the robot already knows the Q value of making the action\nthat is moving through the Upper State and we know\nthat the environment is stochastic in nature\nand the reward\nthat the robot will get after moving to the Upper State\nmight be different from an earlier observation.\nSo how do we capture this change the real difference?\nWe calculate the new q s comma a with the same formula\nand subtract the Previously known qsa from it.\nSo this will in turn give us the new QA.\nNow the equation\nthat we just derived gifts the temporal difference\nin the Q values\nwhich further helps to capture the random changes\nin the environment\nwhich may impose now the name q s comma a\nis updated as the following so Q T of s comma is equal\nto QT minus 1 s comma a\nplus Alpha D DT of a comma\ns now here Allah Alpha is the learning rate which controls\nhow quickly the robot adapts to the random changes imposed\nby the environment the qts comma is the current state q value\nand a QT minus 1 s comma is the previously recorded Q value.\nSo if we replace the TDS comma a with its full form equation,\nwe should get Q T of s comma is equal to QT -\n1 of s comma y\nplus Alpha into R of s comma a plus gamma maximum.\nQ s Dash a dash minus QT\nminus 1 s comma a now\nthat we have all the little pieces of q line together.\nLet's move forward to its implementation part.\nNow, this is the final equation of q-learning, right?\nSo, let's see\nhow we can implement this and obtain the best path\nfor any robot to take now to implement the algorithm.\nWe need to understand the warehouse location\nand how that can be mapped to different states.\nSo let's start by reconnecting the sample environment.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have L1 L2 L3 to align and as you can see here,\nwe have certain borders also.\nSo first of all,\nlet's map each of the above locations in the warehouse\ntwo numbers or the states\nso that it will ease our calculations, right?\nSo what I'm going to do is create a new Python 3 file\nin the jupyter notebook and I'll name it as q-learning.\nNumber.\nOkay.\nSo let's define the states.\nBut before that what we need to do is import numpy\nbecause we're going to use numpy\nfor this purpose and let's initialize the parameters.\nThat is the gamma and Alpha parameters.\nSo gamma is 0.75\nwhich is the discount Factor whereas Alpha is 0.9,\nwhich is the learning rate.\nNow next what we're going to do is Define the states and map\nit to numbers.\nSo as I mentioned Earlier l 1 is 0 and Dylan line.\nWe have defined the states in the numerical form.\nNow.\nThe next step is to define the actions which is\nas mentioned above represents the transition\nto the next state.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have an array of actions from 0 to 8.\nNow, what we're going to do is Define the reward table.\nSo as you can see, it's the same Matrix\nthat we created just now\nthat I showed you just now now if you understood it correctly,\nthere isn't any real Barrel limitation\nas depicted in the image,\nfor example, the transitional for tell one is allowed\nbut the reward will be zero to discourage\nthat path or in tough situation.\nWhat we do is add a minus 1 there\nso that it gets a negative reward.\nSo in the above code snippet as you can see here.\nI took each of the states and put once in the respective state\nthat are directly reachable from the certain State now,\nif you refer to that reward table, once again,\nwhat we created the above,\nour reconstruction will be easy to understand\nbut one thing to note here is\nthat we did not consider the top priority location L6 yet.\nWe would also need an inverse mapping\nfrom the state's back to its original location\nand it will be cleaner\nwhen we reach to the utter depths of the algorithms.\nSo for that what we're going to do Is have the inverse\nmap location State delegation.\nWe will take the distinct State and location\nand convert it back.\nNow.\nWhat we'll do is we will now Define a function get optimal\nwhich is the get optimal route,\nwhich will have a start location and an N location.\nDon't worry.\nThe code is pick\nbut I'll explain you each and every bit of the code.\nNow the get optimal route function will take\ntwo arguments the style location in the warehouse\nand the end location in the warehouse recipe lovely\nand it will return the optimal route\nfor reaching the end location\nfrom the starting location in the form of an ordered list\ncontaining the letters.\nSo we'll start by defining\nthe function by initializing the Q values to be all zeros.\nSo as you can see here,\nwe have given the Q value has to be 0 but For that\nwhat we need to do is copy the reward Matrix to a new one.\nSo this is the rewards new and next again.\nWhat we need to do is get the ending State corresponding\nto the ending location.\nAnd with this information automatically will set\nthe priority of the given ending stay to the highest one\nthat we are not defining it now,\nbut will automatically set the priority\nof the given ending State as nine nine nine.\nSo what we're going to do is initialize\nthe Q values to be 0 and in the queue learning process\nwhat you can see See here.\nWe are taking I in range 1,000 and we're going\nto pick up a state randomly.\nSo we're going to use the MP dot random r + NT\nand for traversing through the neighbor location\nin the same maze.\nWe're going to iterate through the new reward\nMatrix and get the actions\nwhich are greater than 0 and after that\nwhat we're going to do is pick an action randomly from the list\nof the playable actions\nin years to the next state\nwill going to compute the temporal difference,\nwhich is TD,\nwhich is the rewards plus gamma into The queue of next state\nand will take n p dot ARG Max\nof Q of next eight minus Q of the current state.\nWe going to then update\nthe Q values using the Bellman equation\nas you can see here,\nyou have the Bellman equation\nand we're going to update the Q values\nand after that we're going to initialize the optimal route\nwith a starting location now here we do not know\nwhat the next location yet.\nSo initialize it with the value of the starting location,\nwhich again is the random Shh now we do not know\nabout the exact number of iteration needed to reach\nto the final location.\nHence while loop will be a good choice for the iteration.\nSo when you're going to fetch the starting State fetch\nthe highest Q value penetrating\nto the starting State we go to the index\nor the next state,\nbut we need the corresponding letter.\nSo we're going to use that state to location function.\nWe just mentioned there\nand after that we're going to update the starting location\nfor the next iteration.\nFinally, we'll return the root.\nSo let's take the starting location of n line\nand and location of L1 and see what part do we actually get?\nSo as you can see here,\nwe get Airline l8l five L2 and L1.\nAnd if you have a look at the image here,\nwe have if we start from L9\nto L1 we got l8l 5 L 2 l 1 L HL 5 L2 L1.\nThat would yield us the maximum.\nMm value of the maximum reward for the robot.\nSo now we have come to the end\nof this Q learning session the past year has seen a lot\nof great examples for machine learning\nand many new high-impact\napplication of machine learning with discovered\nand brought to light especially in the healthcare Finance\nthe speech recognition augmented reality\nand much more complex 3D and video applications.\nThe natural language processing was easily\nthe most talked about domain\nwithin the community with the likes of you.\nLmf it and but being open sourced.\nSo let's have a look\nat some of the amazing machine learning projects\nwhich are open sourced the code is available for you.\nAnd those are discussed in this 2018 to nine in Spectrum.\nSo the first and the foremost is tensorflow dot DS now\nmachine learning in the browser\nor fictional thought a few years back.\nBack and a stunning reality.\nNow a lot of us in this field are welded to our favorite IDE,\nbut tells of not DOT JS has the potential to change your habits.\nIt's become a very popular released since its release\nearlier this year\nand continues to amaze with its flexibility.\nNow as a repository states,\nthere are primarily three major features\nof terms of rho dot J's develop machine learning\nand deep learning models\nin your process itself run pre-existent as\na flow models within the browser retrain our Gene\nthese prediction models as well.\nAnd if you are familiar with Kara's the high-level layers\nEPA will seem quite familiar,\nbut there are plenty of examples available on GitHub repository.\nSo do check out those legs to Quicken your learning curve.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nI'll leave the links to all of these open\nsource machine learning projects in the description below.\nThe next what we not discuss is detector\non it is developed by Facebook and made a huge Splash\nwhen it was earlier launched in.\nAn 80 those developed by Facebook's AI research team,\nwhich is fa ir.\nAnd it implements the state\nof the art object detection frame was it\nis written in Python\nand as help enable multiple projects\nincluding the dance pose.\nNow, we'll know\nwhat exactly is then suppose after this example\nand this repository contains the code\nof over 70 preacher involves.\nSo it's a very good open source small guys.\nSo to check it out now the moment I talked\nabout then suppose.\nThat's the next one.\nI'm going to talk about so\nThat's supposed stents human pose estimation in the wild,\nbut the code to train and evaluate your own dance pose\nusing the our CNN model is included here\nand I've given the link to the open source code\nin the description below\nand there are notebooks available as well to visualize\ncertain Sports cocoa data set the next on our list.\nWe have D painterly harmonization.\nNow, I want you to take a moment to just admire\nthe above images.\nCan you tell which ones we're done by a human\nand which one by a machine?\nI certainly could not now here.\nThe first frame is the input image the original one\nand a third frame\nas you can see here has been generated by\nthis technique amazing, right?\nThe algorithm has an external object\nto your choosing to any image\nand manages it to make it look like nothing touched it now,\nmake sure you check out the code and try to implement it\non different sets of images yourself.\nIt is really really fun.\nBut talking about images.\nWe have image out painting now\nwhat if I give you an image and ask you to extend Its boundaries\nby imagining what it would look\nlike when the entire scene was captured.\nYou would understandably turn to some image editing software.\nBut here's the awesome news.\nYou can achieve it in few lines of code,\nwhich is the image out painting.\nNow.\nThis project is Akira's implementation of Stanford image\nout failing paper,\nwhich is incredibly cool and Illustrated paper.\nAnd this is how most research paper should be.\nI've given the links in the description\nbelow to check it out guys and see how you can.\nImplement it now.\nLet's talk about audio processing which is\nan another field\nwhere machine learning has started to make its mark.\nIt is not just limited to generate music.\nYou can do tasks like audio classification fingerprinting\nsegmentation tagging and much more and there is a lot\nthat's still yet to be explored\nand who knows perhaps you could use this project\nto Pioneer your way to the top.\nNow what if you want to discover your own planner now\nthat might perhaps be overstating things a bit,\nbut the astronaut repository will definitely get you close.\nThe Google brain team discovered\ntwo new planets in the summer 2017 by applying the astronaut.\nIt's a deep neural network meant for working\nwith astronomical data.\nIt goes to show the far-ranging application\nof machine learning and was a truly Monumental development.\nAnd now the team\nbehind the technology has open source the entire code,\nso go ahead and check out your own planet and\nwho knows you might even have a planet on your name now,\nI could not possibly let this section.\nPass by without mentioning the brt.\nThe Google AI is released has smashed record on his way\nto winning the hearts of NLP enthusiasts\nand experts alike following you.\nLmf it and he LMO brt really blew away the competition\nwith its performance.\nIt obtained a state of art result\non 11 and LP task apart from the official Google repository.\nThere is a python implementation of birth,\nwhich is worth checking out whether it makes a new era\nor not in natural language processing.\nThe thing we will soon find out now add on it.\nI'm sure you guys might have heard of it.\nIt is a framework for automatically learning\nhigh quality models without requiring programming expertise\nsince it's a Google invention.\nThe framework is based on tensorflow and you can build\nand simple models using a Danette\nand even extend it to use to train a neural network.\nNow the GitHub page contains the code and example\nthe API documentation\nand other things to get your hands dirty the trust me\nOtto ml is the next big thing.\nNG in our field now\nif you follow a few researchers on social media,\nyou must have come across some of the images.\nI am showing here\nin a video form a stick human running across the terrain\nor trying to stand up or some sort,\nbut that my friends is reinforcement learning\nand action now,\nhere's a signature example of it a framework to create\na simulated humanoid to imitate multiple motion skin.\nSo let's have a look at the top 10 skills.\nAre required to become\na successful machine learning engineer.\nSo starting with programming languages python\nis the lingua Franca of machine learning.\nYou may have had exposure to buy them.\nEven if you weren't previously\nin programming or in a computer science research field.\nHowever, it is important to have a solid understanding of glasses\nand data structures.\nSometimes python won't be enough often.\nYou'll encounter projects\nthat need to leverage hardware for Speed improvements.\nNow, make sure you are familiar with the basic algorithms as\nwell as the classes.\nMemory management and linking now\nif you want a job in machine learning,\nyou will probably have to learn all of these languages\nat some point C++ can help in speeding code up.\nWhereas our works great in statistics and plots\nand Hadoop is java-based.\nSo you probably need to implement mappers\nand reducers in Java.\nNow next we have linear algebra.\nYou need to be intimately familiar with mattresses vectors\nand matrix multiplication\nif you have an understanding of derivatives and integrals,\nYou should be in the clear.\nOtherwise even simple concept\nlike gradient descent will elude you statistic\nis going to come up a lot at least make sure you are familiar\nwith the caution distributions means standard deviation\nand much more every bit of statistical understanding\nBeyond this helps the theories help in learning\nabout algorithms great samples are naive buys\ngaussian mixture models and hidden Markov models.\nYou need to have a firm understanding of probability\nand stats to understand these these models just go nuts\nand study measure Theory\nand next we have advanced signal processing techniques.\nNow feature extraction is one of the most important parts\nof machine learning different types of problems\nneed various Solutions.\nYou may be able to utilize really cool Advanced\nsignal processing algorithms such as wavelets share.\nLet's go blades and bandless you need to learn\nabout the time-frequency analysis and try to apply it\nin your problems.\nNow, this skill will give you an edge over all\nthe other skills not this kid.\nWill give you an edge\nwhile you're applying\nfor a machine learning engine the job or others\nor next we have applied\nmaths a lot of machine learning techniques out.\nThere are just fancy types of functional approximation.\nNow these often get developed by theoretical mathematician\nand then get applied by people\nwho do not understand the theory at all.\nNow the result is\nthat many developers might have a hard time\nfinding the best techniques for the problem.\nSo even a basic understanding of numerical analysis will give\nyou a huge Edge having a firm understanding.\nEnding of algorithm Theory and knowing\nhow the algorithm works.\nYou can also discriminate models such as svm's now you will need\nto understand subjects such as\ngradient descent convex optimization LaGrange\nquadratic programming partial differentiation equations\nand much more now all this math might seem intimidating at first\nif you have been away from it for a while just\nmachine learning is much more math intensive\nthan something like front-end developer.\nJust like any other skill getting better at math is a man.\nOur Focus practice the next skill\nin our list is the neural network architectures.\nWe need machine learning for tasks that are too complex\nfor human to quote directly that is tasks\nthat are so complex\nthat it is Impractical now neural networks are a class\nof models within the general machine learning literature\nor neural networks are a specific set of algorithms\nthat have revolutionized machine learning.\nThey're inspired by biological neural networks,\nand the current so-called deep neural networks\nhave proven to work quite well.\nWell, the neural networks are themselves\nGeneral function approximations,\nwhich is why they\ncan be applied to almost any machine learning problem\nabout learning a complex mapping\nfrom the input to the output space.\nOf course, there are still good reason for the surge\nin the popularity of neural networks,\nbut neural networks have been by far the most accurate way of\napproaching many problems like translation speech recognition\nand image classification now coming to our next point\nwhich is the natural language processing now\nsince it combines computer science and Listed,\nthere are a bunch of libraries like the NLT K chances.\nMm and the techniques such as sentimental analysis\nand summarization\nthat are unique to NLP now audio and video processing\nhas a frequent overlap with the natural language processing.\nHowever, natural language processing can be applied\nto non audio data like text voice\nand audio analysis involves extracting useful information\nfrom the audio signals themselves being well-versed\nin math will get you far in this one\nand you should also be familiar.\nHer with the concepts such as the fast Fourier transforms.\nNow, these were the technical skills\nthat are required\nto become a successful machine learning engineer.\nSo next I'm going to discuss some of the non-technical skills\nor the soft skills,\nwhich are required to become a machine-learning engineer.\nSo first of all, we have the industry knowledge.\nNow the most successful machine learning projects out.\nThere are going to be those\nthat address real pain points whichever industry we\nare working for you should know\nhow that industry works\nand Will be beneficial for the business\nif a machine learning engineer does not have business Acumen\nand the know-how of the elements\nthat make up a successful business model\nor any particular algorithm.\nThen all those technical skills cannot be Channel productively,\nyou won't be able to discern the problems\nand potential challenges that need solving\nfor the business to sustain\nand grow you won't really be able to help\nyour organization explore new business opportunities.\nSo this is a must-have skill now next we\nhave effective communication.\nYou'll need to explain the machine learning\nConcepts to the people with little to no expertise\nin the field chances are you'll need to work\nwith a team of Engineers as well as many other teams.\nSo communication is going to make all of this much\nmore easier companies searching\nfor a strong machine learning engineer looking for someone\nwho can clearly\nand fluently translate their technical findings\nto a non technical team such as marketing\nor sales department and next on our list.\nWe have rapid prototyping so Iterating on ideas as quickly as\npossible is mandatory for finding one\nthat works in machine learning this applies to everything\nfrom picking up the right model\nto working on projects such as A/B Testing\nyou need to do a group\nof techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model\nof a physical part\nor assembly using\nthe three-dimensional computer aided design,\nwhich is the cat so last\nbut not the least we have the final skill\nand that is to keep updated.\nYou must stay up to date with Any upcoming changes\nevery month new neural network models come out\nthat are performed the previous architecture.\nIt also means being aware\nof the news regarding the development of the tools\nthe changelog the conferences\nand much more you\nneed to know about the theories and algorithms.\nNow this you can achieve\nby reading the research papers blogs the conference's videos.\nAnd also you need to focus on the online community\nwith changes very quickly.\nSo expect and cultivate this change now,\nthis is not the Here we have certain skills the bonus skills,\nwhich will give you an edge over other competitors\nor the other persons\nwho are applying\nfor a machine-learning engineer position on the bonus point.\nWe have physics.\nNow, you might be in a situation\nwhere you're like to apply machine learning techniques\nto A system\nthat will interact with the real world having some knowledge\nof physics will take you far the next we\nhave reinforcement learning.\nSo this reinforcement learning has been a driver\nbehind many of the most exciting developments\nin the Deep learning\nand the AI community.\nT from the alphago zero to the open a is Dota 2 pot.\nThis will be a critical to understand\nif you want to go into robotics self-driving cars\nor other AI related areas.\nAnd finally we have\ncomputer vision out of all the disciplines out there.\nThere are by far\nthe most resources available for learning computer vision.\nThis field appears to have the lowest barriers to entry\nbut of course this\nlikely means you will face slightly more competition.\nSo having a good knowledge of computer vision\nhow it rolls will give you an edge.\nOther competitors now.\nI hope you got acquainted with all the skills\nwhich are required to become a successful\nmachine learning engineer.\nAs you know,\nwe are living in the worlds of humans and machines\nin today's world.\nThese machines are the robots have to be programmed\nbefore they start following your instructions.\nBut what if the machine started\nlearning on its own from their experience work like us\nand feel like us\nand do things more accurately than us now?\nWell his machine learning Angela comes into picture to make sure\neverything is working according to the procedures\nand the guidelines.\nSo in my opinion machine learning is one of the most\nrecent and And Technologies,\nthere is you probably use it at dozens of times every day\nwithout even knowing it.\nSo before we indulge\ninto the different roles the salary Trends\nand what should be there on the resume\nof a machine learning engineer\nwhile applying for a job.\nLet's understand\nwho exactly a machine learning engineering is so machine\nlearning Engineers are sophisticated programmers\nwho develop machines and systems\nthat can learn\nand apply knowledge without specific Direction artificial\nintelligence is the goal of a machine-learning engineer.\nThey are computer programmers\nbut their focus goes beyond specifically\nprogramming machines to perform specific tasks.\nThey create programs\nthat will enable machines to take actions\nwithout being specifically directed to perform those tasks.\nNow if we have a look at the job trends\nof machine learning in general.\nSo as you can see in Seattle itself,\nwe have 2,000 jobs in New York.\nWe have 1100 San Francisco.\nWe have 1100 in Bengaluru India,\nwe have 1100 and then we have Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia where we have If I were a number of jobs,\nso as you can see the number of jobs in the market is too much\nand probably with the emergence of machine learning\nand artificial intelligence.\nThis number is just going to get higher now.\nIf you have a look at the job opening salary-wise percentage,\nso you can see for the $90,000 per annum bracket.\nWe have 32.7 percentage and that's the maximum.\nSo be assured\nthat if you get a job as a machine-learning engineer,\nyou'll probably get around 90 thousand bucks a year.\nThat's safe to say.\nNow for the hundred and ten thousand dollars per year.\nWe have 25% $120,000.\nWe have 20 percent\nalmost then we have a hundred and thirty thousand dollars\nwhich are the senior machine learning and Jenna's\nthat's a 13 point 6 7% And finally,\nwe have the most senior machine learning engineer\nor we have the data scientist here,\nwhich have the salary\nof a hundred and forty thousand dollars per annum\nand the percentage for that one is really low.\nSo as you can see there is a great opportunity for people.\nWhat trying to go into machine learning field\nand get started with it?\nSo let's have a look at the machine learning\nin junior salary.\nSo the average salary in the u.s.\nIs around a hundred eleven thousand four hundred\nand ninety dollars\nand the average salary in India is around\nseven last nineteen thousand six hundred forty six rupees.\nThat's a very good average salary\nfor any particular profession.\nSo moving forward if we have a look\nat the salary of an entry-level machine learning.\nYou know, so the salary ranges from $76,000\nor seventy seven thousand dollars two hundred\nand fifty one thousand dollars per annum.\nThat's a huge salary.\nAnd if you talk about the bonus here,\nwe have like\nthree thousand dollars to twenty five thousand dollars depending\non the work YouTube and the project you are working on.\nLet's talk about the profit sharing now.\nSo it's around two thousand dollars\nto fifty thousand dollars.\nNow this again depends\nupon the project you are working the company you are working\nfor and the percentage\nthat Give to the in general or the developer\nfor that particular project.\nNow, the total pay comes around seventy six thousand dollars\nor seventy-five thousand dollars\ntwo hundred and sixty two thousand dollars\nand this is just for the entry level machine learning engineer.\nJust imagine if you become an experience machine\nlearning engineer your salary is going to go through the roof.\nSo now that we have understood\nwho exactly is a machine learning engineer\nthe various salary Trends the job Trends in the market\nand how it's rising.\nLet's understand.\nWhat skills it takes to become a machine learning engine.\nSo first of all,\nwe have programming languages now programming languages are\nbig deal when it comes to machine learning\nbecause you don't just need to have Proficiency\nin one language you might require Proficiency in Python.\nJava are or C++\nbecause you might be working in a Hadoop environment\nwhere you require\nJava programming to do the mapreduce Coatings\nand sometimes our is very great\nfor visualization purposes and python has you know,\nAnother favorite languages\nwhen comes to machine learning now next scale\nthat particular individual needs is calculus and statistics.\nSo a lot of machine learning algorithms are mostly\nmaths and statistics.\nSo and a lot of static\nis required majorly the matrix multiplication\nand all so good understanding\nof calculus as well as statistic is required.\nNow next we have\nsignal processing now Advanced signal processing is something\nthat will give you an upper Edge\nover other machine learning engine is\nif you are Applying for a job anywhere.\nNow the next kill we have is applied maths\nas I mentioned earlier many of the machine\nlearning algorithms here are purely mathematical formulas.\nSo a good understanding of maths and how the algorithm Works\nwill take you far ahead the next on our list.\nWe have neural networks.\nNo real networks are something\nthat has been emerging\nquite popularly in the recent years and due to its efficiency\nand the extent to which it can walk and get the results\nas soon as possible.\nNeural networks are a must\nfor machine learning engine now moving forward.\nWe have language processing.\nSo a lot of times machine learning Engineers have to deal\nwith text Data the voice data as well as video data now\nprocessing any kind of language audio\nor the video is something\nthat a machine-learning engineer has to do on a daily basis.\nSo one needs to be proficient in this area also now,\nthese are only some of the few skills\nwhich are absolutely necessary.\nI would say for any machine learning\nand Engineer so let's now discuss the job description\nor the roles\nand responsibilities\nof a particular machine learning engineer now\ndepending on their level\nof expertise machine learning Engineers may have\nto study and transform data science prototypes.\nThey need to design machine Learning Systems.\nThey also need to research and Implement appropriate machine\nlearning algorithms and tools\nas it's a very important part of the job.\nThey need to develop new machine learning application\naccording to the industry requirements the Select\nthe appropriate data sets\nand the data representation methods\nbecause if there is a slight deviation in the data set\nand the data representation\nthat's going to affect Model A lot.\nThey need to run machine learning tests and experiments.\nThey need to perform statistical analysis\nand fine-tuning using the test results.\nSo sometimes people ask\nwhat exactly is a difference between a data analyst\nand a machine learning engineer.\nSo so static analysis\njust a small part of of machine learning Engineers job.\nWhereas it is a major part\nor it probably covers a large part of a data analyst job\nrather than a machine learning Engineers job.\nSo machine learning Engineers might need to train\nand retrain the systems whenever necessary\nand they also need\nto extend the existing machine learning libraries\nand Frameworks to their full potential\nso that they could make the model Works superbly\nand finally they need to keep abreast of the developments\nin the field needless to say\nthat any machine.\nIn general or any particular individual has to stay updated\nto the technologies\nthat are coming in the market\nand every now and then a new technology arises\nwhich will overthrow the older one.\nSo you need to be up to date now coming\nto the resume part of a machine learning engineer.\nSo any resume of a particular machine learning Engineers\nshould consist like clear career objective skills,\nwhich a particular individual possesses\nthe educational qualification\ncertain certification the past experience\nif you are an experienced machine learning and Jen\nare the projects which you have worked on and that's it.\nSo let's have a look at the various elements\nthat are required\nin a machine-learning Engineers resume.\nSo first of all,\nyou need to have a clear career objective.\nSo here you will need not stretch it too much\nand keep it as precise as possible.\nSo next we have the skills required and these skills\ncan be technical as well as non technical.\nSo let's have a look\nat the various Technical and non-technical skills out here.\nSo starting with the technical skills.\nFirst of all,\nwe have programming languages as an our Java Python and C++.\nBut the first\nand the foremost requirement is to have a good grip\non any programming languages preferably python\nas it is easy to learn\nand it's applications are wider than any other language now,\nit is important to have a good understanding of topics\nlike data structures memory management and classes.\nAll the python is a very good language it\nalone cannot help you\nso you will probably have to learn all\nthese he's languages like C++ are python Java\nand also work on mapreduce\nat some point of time the next on our list.\nWe have calculus and linear algebra and statistics.\nSo you'll need to be intimately familiar\nwith matrices the vectors and the matrix multiplication.\nSo statistics is going to come up a lot\nand at least make sure you are familiar\nwith caution distribution means standard deviations\nand much more.\nSo you also need to have a firm understanding of probability.\nStats to understand the machine learning models the next\nas I mentioned earlier, it's signal processing techniques.\nSo feature extraction is one of the most important parts\nof machine learning\ndifferent types of problems need various Solutions.\nSo you may be able to utilize\nthe really cool Advanced signal processing algorithms such as\nwavelengths shallots curve.\nLet's and the ballast so try to learn about\nthe time-frequency analysis and try to apply it to your problems\nas it gives you an upper jaw.\nOur other machine learning Engineers,\nso just go for the next we\nhave mathematics and a lot of machine learning techniques out.\nThere are just fancy types of function approximation\nhaving a firm understanding of algorithm Theory and knowing\nhow the algorithm works is really necessary\nand understanding subjects\nlike gradient descent convex optimization\nquadratic programming\nand partial differentiation will help a lot the neural networks\nas I was talking earlier.\nSo we need machine learning for tasks that are too Flex\nfor humans to quote directly.\nSo that is the tasks that are so complex\nthat it is Impractical neural networks are a class\nof models within the general machine learning literature.\nThey are specific set of algorithms\nthat have revolutionized machine\nlearning deep neural networks have proven to work quite well\nand neural networks\nare themself General function approximations,\nwhich is why they can be applied\nto almost any machine learning problem out there\nand they help a lot about learning a complex mapping\nfrom the input\nto The output space now next we have language processing\nsince natural language processing combines two\nof the major areas of work\nthat are linguistic and computer science\nand chances are at some point you are going to work\nwith either text or audio or the video.\nSo it's necessary to have a control over libraries\nlike gents mm and ltk\nand techniques like what to wet sentimental analysis\nand text summarization Now voice\nand audio analysis involves extracting useful information\nfrom the Your signals themselves very well versed in maths\nand concept like Fourier transformation will get\nyou far in this one.\nThese were the technical skills that are required but be assured\nthat there are a lot of non technical skills.\nAlso that are required to land a good job\nin a machine learning industry.\nSo first of all,\nyou need to have an industry knowledge.\nSo the most successful machine learning projects out.\nThere are going to be those that address real pain points,\ndon't you agree?\nSo whichever industry are working for You should know\nhow that industry works\nand what will be beneficial for the industry.\nNow, if a machine learning engineer\ndoes not have business Acumen and the know-how of the elements\nthat make up a successful business model.\nAll those technical skills cannot be\nchanneled productively.\nYou won't be able to discern the problems\nand the potential challenges that need solving\nfor the business to sustain and grow the next on our list.\nWe have effective communication and not this is one\nof the most important parts in any job requirements.\nSo you'll need to In machine learning Concepts to people\nwith little to no expertise in the field a chances are\nyou will need to work with a team of Engineers\nas well as many other teams like marketing\nand the sales team.\nSo communication is going to make all of this much\neasier companies searching\nfor the strong machine learning engineer looking for someone\nwho can clearly and fluency translate technical findings\nto a non technical team.\nRapid prototyping is another skill,\nwhich is very much required for any machine learning engineer.\nSo iterating on ideas as quickly as possible is mandatory\nfor finding the one\nthat works in machine learning this applies to everything\nfrom picking the right model\nto working on projects such as a/b testing\nand much more now you need to do a group\nof techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model\nof a physical part\nor assembly using\nthe three-dimensional computer aided design,\nwhich is the cat data now coming to the final skills,\nwhich will be required\nfor any machine learning agenda is to keep updated.\nSo you must stay up to date with any upcoming changes\nevery month new neural network models come out\nthat outperformed the previous architecture.\nIt also means being aware of the news regarding the development\nof the tools Theory\nand algorithms through research papers blocks conference videos\nand much more.\nNow another part of any machine learning engineer's resume is\nthe education qualification.\nSo a bachelor's\nor master's degree in computer science RIT economics statistics\nor even mathematics can help.\nUp you land a job in machine learning plus\nif you are an experienced machine learning engineer,\nso probably some standard company certifications\nwill help you a lot\nwhen Landing a good job in machine learning\nand finally coming to the professional experience.\nYou need to have experience in computer science statistics data\nas is if you are switching\nfrom any other profession into a machine learning engineer,\nor if you have a previous experience in machine learning\nthat is very well.\nNow finally if we talk about The projects\nso you need to have not just any project\nthat you have worked on you need to have working on machine\nlearning related projects\nthat involve a certain level of AI\nand working on neural networks to a certain degree\nto land a good job as a machine-learning engineer.\nNow if you have a look at the company's hiring machine\nlearning Engineers,\nso every other company is looking\nfor machine learning Engineers\nwho can modify the existing model to something\nthat did not need much more.\nOf Maintenance and cancel sustain so basically working\non artificial intelligence and new algorithms\nthat can work on their own is what every company deserves.\nSo Amazon Facebook.\nWe have Tech giants\nlike Microsoft IBM again in the gaming industry,\nwe have or the GPU industry Graphics industry.\nWe have Nvidia in banking industry.\nWe have JPMorgan Chase again,\nwe have LinkedIn and also we have Walmart.\nSo all of these companies require machine learning engine\nat some part of the time.\nSo be assured that\nif you are looking for a machine learning engineer post,\nevery other companies be it a big shot company or even\nthe new startups are looking for machine learning Engineers.\nSo be assured you will get a job now with this we come\nto an end of this video.\nSo I hope you've got a good understanding\nof who exactly are machine learning engineer is\nthe way just job Trends the salary Trends.\nWhat are the skills required to become machine learning engineer\nand once you become a machine-learning engineer,\nwhat are the roles and responsibilities\nor the Job description\nwhat appears to be on the resume or the job description\nwhat appears to be\non the job application of any machine learning engineers?\nAnd also I hope you got to know how to prepare your resume\nor how to prepare it in the correct format.\nAnd what on to keep their\nin the resume the career objectives the skills\nTechnical and non-technical\nprevious experience education qualification\nand certain projects\nwhich are related to it.\nSo that's it guys Ed Rica\nas you know provides a machine learning.\nEngineer master's program now that is aligned in such a way\nthat will get you acquainted in all the skills\nthat are required to become a machine\nlearning engine and that too in the correct form."
