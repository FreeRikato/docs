Dev and in this quick win I want to show you how you can easily use\nwant to show you how you can easily use\nwant to show you how you can easily use a map view in your react native\na map view in your react native\na map view in your react native application I found this to be\napplication I found this to be\napplication I found this to be unbelievable easy so I wanted to do this\nunbelievable easy so I wanted to do this\nunbelievable easy so I wanted to do this quick video and cover the basic round in\nquick video and cover the basic round in\nquick video and cover the basic round in like 10 minutes so you'll be up and\nlike 10 minutes so you'll be up and\nlike 10 minutes so you'll be up and running with a map view in just a matter\nrunning with a map view in just a matter\nrunning with a map view in just a matter of minutes so what I did so far is I\nof minutes so what I did so far is I\nof minutes so what I did so far is I created an expo application as I want to\ncreated an expo application as I want to\ncreated an expo application as I want to use Expo but you can actually also use\nuse Expo but you can actually also use\nuse Expo but you can actually also use it with a react native CLI and I was\nit with a react native CLI and I was\nit with a react native CLI and I was using the TS template so I got file\nusing the TS template so I got file\nusing the TS template so I got file based routing out of the box I then\nbased routing out of the box I then\nbased routing out of the box I then deleted everything in my folder here uh\ndeleted everything in my folder here uh\ndeleted everything in my folder here uh which destroyed my layout so I now have\nwhich destroyed my layout so I now have\nwhich destroyed my layout so I now have to do another index.\nto do another index.\nto do another index. TSX uh putting in a default page and\nTSX uh putting in a default page and\nTSX uh putting in a default page and then also putting a new underscore\nthen also putting a new underscore\nthen also putting a new underscore layout file next to it and that should\nlayout file next to it and that should\nlayout file next to it and that should hopefully uh fix my view again I can\nhopefully uh fix my view again I can\nhopefully uh fix my view again I can then just return a simple stack\nthen just return a simple stack\nthen just return a simple stack navigation using Expo router and if I\nnavigation using Expo router and if I\nnavigation using Expo router and if I run npx Expo it should immediately bring\nrun npx Expo it should immediately bring\nrun npx Expo it should immediately bring up my preview again which I broke\nup my preview again which I broke\nup my preview again which I broke previously good Additionally the most\npreviously good Additionally the most\npreviously good Additionally the most important command to use the map is NP\nimportant command to use the map is NP\nimportant command to use the map is NP Expo install react native Maps so this\nExpo install react native Maps so this\nExpo install react native Maps so this oh yeah of course could like this this\noh yeah of course could like this this\noh yeah of course could like this this here is the important and the critical\nhere is the important and the critical\nhere is the important and the critical part that you want to do so you can\npart that you want to do so you can\npart that you want to do so you can check out the map view in the Expo\ncheck out the map view in the Expo\ncheck out the map view in the Expo documentation it's actually a fairly\ndocumentation it's actually a fairly\ndocumentation it's actually a fairly long document we're going to talk about\nlong document we're going to talk about\nlong document we're going to talk about this here in the end about the\nthis here in the end about the\nthis here in the end about the deployment uh for now I just wonder why\ndeployment uh for now I just wonder why\ndeployment uh for now I just wonder why my views not coming up uh okay yeah it's\nmy views not coming up uh okay yeah it's\nmy views not coming up uh okay yeah it's let's do this again let's just refresh\nlet's do this again let's just

just want to\nfancy nothing map related just want to\nfancy nothing map related just want to cover the basics so if we would follow\ncover the basics so if we would follow\ncover the basics so if we would follow the usage here and we have installed the\nthe usage here and we have installed the\nthe usage here and we have installed the package I will just grab that code put\npackage I will just grab that code put\npackage I will just grab that code put it in here\nit in here\nit in here and that was that was not what I wanted\nand that was that was not what I wanted\nand that was that was not what I wanted to do why is my m not coming up um\nto do why is my m not coming up um\nto do why is my m not coming up um probably because uh how what I did I\nprobably because uh how what I did

that was so great I just wanted to put\nthat was so great I just wanted to put\nthat was so great I just wanted to put it in and show you that it worked like\nit in and show you that it worked like\nit in and show you that it worked like in one second anyway here it is here is\nin one second anyway here it is here is\nin one second anyway here it is here is our map uh we can even do this easier I\nour map uh we can even do this easier I\nour map uh we can even do this easier I can remove this and use flex one in here\ncan remove this and use flex one in here\ncan remove this and use flex one in here and if you don't want uh styling just\nand if you don't want uh styling just\nand if you don't want uh styling just want the map to full the whole Space you\nwant the map to full the whole Space you\nwant the map to full the whole Space you can just use uh stylesheet do absolute\ncan just use uh stylesheet do absolute\ncan just use uh stylesheet do absolute fill and you see as a result same\nfill and you see as a result same\nfill and you see as a result same behavior in the map fills our view good\nbehavior in the map fills our view good\nbehavior in the map fills our view good so that is the starting point for the\nso that is the starting point for the\nso that is the starting point for the map you see this is on the iOS simulator\nmap you see this is on the iOS simulator\nmap you see this is on the iOS simulator using Apple maps you can if you want to\nusing Apple maps you can if you want to\nusing Apple maps you can if you want to you can use it usually people want to\nyou can use it usually people want to\nyou can use it usually people want to use a Google with it so in that case you\nuse a Google with it so in that case you\nuse a Google with it so in that case you can simply change this and use the\ncan simply change this and use the\ncan simply change this and use the provider uh and I don't recommend you\nprovider uh and I don't recommend you\nprovider uh and I don't recommend you use a string you're going to break break\nuse a string you're going to break break\nuse a string you're going to break break a lot with that you should use provider\na lot with that you should use provider\na lot with that you should use provider Google for your application if you\nGoogle for your application if you\nGoogle for your application if you change that immediately it becomes a\nchange that immediately it becomes a\nchange that immediately it becomes a Google map instead by the way this is\nGoogle map instead by the way this is\nGoogle map instead by the way this is usually focusing on what you select for\nusually focusing on what you select for\nusually focusing on what you select for the simulator uh so on iOS on your Mech\nthe simulator uh so on iOS on your Mech\nthe simulator uh so on iOS on your Mech device you can go to Features location\ndevice you can go to Features location\ndevice you can go to Features location and then add something like a custom\nand then add something like a custom\nand then add something like a custom location so this comes up or you can use\nlocation so this comes up or you can use\nlocation so this comes up or you can use a few of the Apple previously defin it\na few of the Apple previously defin it\na few of the Apple previously defin it and then it will set basically the\nand then it will set basically the\nand then it will set basically the location for your\nlocation for your\nlocation for your emulator so how do we work with the map\nemulator so how do we work with the map\nemulator so how do we work with the map this is just displaying the map so let's\nthis is just displaying the map so let's\nthis is just displaying the map so let's talk about a few of the basics the first\ntalk about a few of the basics the first\ntalk about a few of the basics the first thing that you usually want to do is you\nthing that you usually want to do is you\nthing that you usually want to do is you want to set an initial region for the\nwant to set an initial region for the\nwant to set an initial region for the map that means when the map loads it\nmap that means when the map loads it\nmap that means when the map loads it will focus on this region so I can now\nwill focus on this region so I can now\nwill focus on this region so I can now just go ahead into the map and say hey\njust go ahead into the map and say hey\njust go ahead into the map and say hey my initial region is this and now we see\nmy initial region is this and now we see\nmy initial region is this and now we see when the map loads I'm suddenly here in\nwhen the map loads I'm suddenly here in\nwhen the map loads I'm suddenly here in San Francisco somewhere as this is uh\nSan Francisco somewhere as this is uh\nSan Francisco somewhere as this is uh the initial region that I have\nthe initial region that I have\nthe initial region that I have specified this won't change so if you\nspecified this won't change so if you\nspecified this won't change so if you put this now into a state and change\nput this now into a state and change\nput this now into a state and change your initial region it won't change so\nyour initial region it won't change so\nyour initial region it won't change so you really have to set in that case uh\nyou really have to set in that case uh\nyou really have to set in that case uh the region so you could keep a state in\nthe region so you could keep a state in\nthe region so you could keep a state in here and then just use your initial\nhere and then just use your initial\nhere and then just use your initial region as the initial region and the\nregion as the initial region and the\nregion as the initial region and the state the region can be changed if you\nstate the region can be changed if you\nstate the region can be changed if you want to that would be one idea\nwant to that would be one idea\nwant to that would be one idea Additionally you can of course also\nAdditionally you can of course also\nAdditionally you can of course also change styling you can change a bunch of\nchange styling you can change a bunch of\nchange styling you can change a bunch of things I highly recommend that you check\nthings I highly recommend that you check\nthings I highly recommend that you check out the documentation here on the um on\nout the documentation here on the um on\nout the documentation here on the um on the react native map and especially the\nthe react native map and especially the\nthe react native map and especially the map view component so we've covered\nmap view component so we've covered\nmap view component so we've covered provider and region and this is all you\nprovider and region and this is all you\nprovider and region and this is all you can do really there's a lot you can do\ncan do really there's a lot you can do\ncan do really there's a lot you can do with that component uh just showing you\nwith that component uh just showing you\nwith that component uh just showing you two more things so what you could do as\ntwo more things so what you could do as\ntwo more things so what you could do as well is beyond that saying hey show the\nwell is beyond that saying hey show the\nwell is beyond that saying hey show the user location uh which will result in\nuser location uh which will result in\nuser location uh which will result in the user location showing up here so\nthe user location showing up here so\nthe user location showing up here so this is where I'm currently placed or\nthis is where I'm currently placed or\nthis is where I'm currently placed or you could also additionally add uh\nyou could also additionally add uh\nyou could also additionally add uh show where is it show my location button\nshow where is it show my location button\nshow where is it show my location button so now I'm of course covering this with\nso now I'm of course covering this with\nso now I'm of course covering this with my head but I could now use this to dive\nmy head but I could now use this to dive\nmy head but I could now use this to dive into uh where my user is currently Focus\ninto uh where my user is currently Focus\ninto uh where my user is currently Focus if I move away I would go back there so\nif I move away I would go back there so\nif I move away I would go back there so these are just the cool minor things\nthese are just the cool minor things\nthese are just the cool minor things about Google Maps that make the usage of\nabout Google Maps that make the usage of\nabout Google Maps that make the usage of the map view really really easy um\nthe map view really really easy um\nthe map view really really easy um beyond that there are a few more things\nbeyond that there are a few more things\nbeyond that there are a few more things that I want to show you so first of all\nthat I want to show you so first of all\nthat I want to show you so first of all I want to show you that you can also\nI want to show you that you can also\nI want to show you that you can also control this of course from code so what\ncontrol this of course from code so what\ncontrol this of course from code so what you can do is you can start by defining\nyou can do is you can start by defining\nyou can do is you can start by defining a me ref and then telling this use rev\na me ref and then telling this use rev\na me ref and then telling this use rev it is of the type map\nit is of the type map\nit is of the type map view okay and then we assign our map rev\nview okay and then we assign our map rev\nview okay and then we assign our map rev to the map here so this goes in uh\nto the map here so this goes in uh\nto the map here so this goes in uh actually oh can be undefined okay\nactually oh can be undefined okay\nactually oh can be undefined okay okay cool cool uh what's your problem\nokay cool cool uh what's your problem\nokay cool cool uh what's your problem with that oh it's really I mean it's an\nwith that oh it's really I mean it's an\nwith that oh it's really I mean it's an um is it the right map view from react\num is it the right map view from react\num is it the right map view from react native\nnative\nnative Maps uh mutable yeah that's always the\nMaps uh mutable yeah that's always the\nMaps uh mutable yeah that's always the problem with I think I used it like this\nproblem with I think I used it like this\nproblem with I think I used it like this before didn't\nbefore didn't\nbefore didn't I I don't want to make this a typescript\nI I don't want to make this a typescript\nI I don't want to make this a typescript tutorial so therefore I will just say\ntutorial so therefore I will just say\ntutorial so therefore I will just say that this could also be\nthat this could also be\nthat this could also be any um then we'll of course remove our\nany um then we'll of course remove our\nany um then we'll of course remove our typings a bit but it should work for now\ntypings a bit but it should work for now\ntypings a bit but it should work for now anyway um so let's add a button we can\nanyway um so let's add a button we can\nanyway um so let's add a button we can add a button let's add a button to the\nadd a button let's add a button to the\nadd a button let's add a button to the top bar I will just use uh\ntop bar I will just use uh\ntop bar I will just use uh navigation use\nnavigation use\nnavigation use navigation equal use navigation from the\nnavigation equal use navigation from the\nnavigation equal use navigation from the Expo router and then we can simply add a\nExpo router and then we can simply add a\nExpo router and then we can simply add a button that will call a focus map\nbutton that will call a focus map\nbutton that will call a focus map function so let's do con Focus map\nfunction so let's do con Focus map\nfunction so let's do con Focus map equals something something and then if\nequals something something and then if\nequals something something and then if we want to place a button to the top we\nwe want to place a button to the top we\nwe want to place a button to the top we could just do it like this so this is\ncould just do it like this so this is\ncould just do it like this so this is just using the navigation package and\njust using the navigation package and\njust using the navigation package and putting a touchable opacity in the\nputting a touchable opacity in the\nputting a touchable opacity in the header right slot that will then call\nheader right slot that will then call\nheader right slot that will then call our Focus map you can place a button\nour Focus map you can place a button\nour Focus map you can place a button everywhere this tutorial is not about uh\neverywhere this tutorial is not about uh\neverywhere this tutorial is not about uh about creating a button it's about the\nabout creating a button it's about the\nabout creating a button it's about the react native map so here is the focus\nreact native map so here is the focus\nreact native map so here is the focus button and if I click it nothing happens\nbutton and if I click it nothing happens\nbutton and if I click it nothing happens because so far we're not doing anything\nbecause so far we're not doing anything\nbecause so far we're not doing anything let's say you want to focus on a\nlet's say you want to focus on a\nlet's say you want to focus on a specific location so you could come up\nspecific location so you could come up\nspecific location so you could come up with the coordinates like this one for\nwith the coordinates like this one for\nwith the coordinates like this one for the green Bas stadium and then you could\nthe green Bas stadium and then you could\nthe green Bas stadium and then you could go ahead with the me rev. current and\ngo ahead with the me rev. current and\ngo ahead with the me rev. current and then you can call a bunch of features so\nthen you can call a bunch of features so\nthen you can call a bunch of features so I really hate that I can I just do it\nI really hate that I can I just do it\nI really hate that I can I just do it like this uh if I do it like this you\nlike this uh if I do it like this you\nlike this uh if I do it like this you would have the code completion for\nwould have the code completion for\nwould have the code completion for everything so really uh it's possibly\neverything so really uh it's possibly\neverything so really uh it's possibly undefined yeah I don't care right now uh\nundefined yeah I don't care right now uh\nundefined yeah I don't care right now uh and in my case I would probably pick any\nand in my case I would probably pick any\nand in my case I would probably pick any M to region and then I would pass in the\nM to region and then I would pass in the\nM to region and then I would pass in the Green Bay Stadium region so if I now\nGreen Bay Stadium region so if I now\nGreen Bay Stadium region so if I now click on Focus see what\nclick on Focus see what\nclick on Focus see what happens we're immediately here and\nhappens we're immediately here and\nhappens we're immediately here and seeing the beautiful Lambo field in\nseeing the beautiful Lambo field in\nseeing the beautiful Lambo field in Green Bay\nGreen Bay\nGreen Bay Wisconsin um this is just one way you\nWisconsin um this is just one way you\nWisconsin um this is just one way you can do a whole lot more if you get the\ncan do a whole lot more if you get the\ncan do a whole lot more if you get the reference to your map you can can call\nreference to your map you can can call\nreference to your map you can can call all um not the events but you can call\nall um not the events but you can call\nall um not the events but you can call all the methods on this so we have used\nall the methods on this so we have used\nall the methods on this so we have used animate to region but you could also use\nanimate to region but you could also use\nanimate to region but you could also use animate camera for example so if I would\nanimate camera for example so if I would\nanimate camera for example so if I would change this to animate camera uh we\nchange this to animate camera uh we\nchange this to animate camera uh we would have to change this and say uh\nwould have to change this and say uh\nwould have to change this and say uh please Focus uh the center on the Green\nplease Focus uh the center on the Green\nplease Focus uh the center on the Green Bay Stadium and then you could even have\nBay Stadium and then you could even have\nBay Stadium and then you could even have another object saying okay please for\nanother object saying okay please for\nanother object saying okay please for the duration like this like 3 seconds\nthe duration like this like 3 seconds\nthe duration like this like 3 seconds long if I do it like\nlong if I do it like\nlong if I do it like this it's not changing the zoom we\nthis it's not changing the zoom we\nthis it's not changing the zoom we should probably change the zoom in that\nshould probably change the zoom in that\nshould probably change the zoom in that case as well uh let the zoom change to I\ncase as well uh let the zoom change to I\ncase as well uh let the zoom change to I don't know 10 let's\ndon't know 10 let's\ndon't know 10 let's see yeah that's better that's a whole\nsee yeah that's better that's a whole\nsee yeah that's better that's a whole lot better that's even like a flying\nlot better that's even like a flying\nlot better that's even like a flying movie I like that one so you see this is\nmovie I like that one so you see this is\nmovie I like that one so you see this is the way how you could interact with your\nthe way how you could interact with your\nthe way how you could interact with your map from code this is of course only the\nmap from code this is of course only the\nmap from code this is of course only the one way it also works the other way so\none way it also works the other way so\none way it also works the other way so you could set up a function that watches\nyou could set up a function that watches\nyou could set up a function that watches when the region changes let's do a\nwhen the region changes let's do a\nwhen the region changes let's do a simple on region change function and we\nsimple on region change function and we\nsimple on region change function and we once again have great typing for all\nonce again have great typing for all\nonce again have great typing for all these functions usually uh only besides\nthese functions usually uh only besides\nthese functions usually uh only besides the my MEAP ref not working with the\nthe my MEAP ref not working with the\nthe my MEAP ref not working with the MEAP VI ref so I could what is this\nMEAP VI ref so I could what is this\nMEAP VI ref so I could what is this Legacy map view mutable object map view\nLegacy map view mutable object map view\nLegacy map view mutable object map view undefined is not assignable legacy ref\nundefined is not assignable legacy ref\nundefined is not assignable legacy ref what is this what really like what oh my\nwhat is this what really like what oh my\nwhat is this what really like what oh my um so how can we use this well we can\num so how can we use this well we can\num so how can we use this well we can simply plug into not the methods but the\nsimply plug into not the methods but the\nsimply plug into not the methods but the events of the map view again I highly\nevents of the map view again I highly\nevents of the map view again I highly recommend the map view document it shows\nrecommend the map view document it shows\nrecommend the map view document it shows you everything you should really study\nyou everything you should really study\nyou everything you should really study this uh documentation if you want to use\nthis uh documentation if you want to use\nthis uh documentation if you want to use a map so now I can go ahead and say on\na map so now I can go ahead and say on\na map so now I can go ahead and say on region change if I would use un region\nregion change if I would use un region\nregion change if I would use un region change this would actually be called the\nchange this would actually be called the\nchange this would actually be called the whole time let me show you um you see my\nwhole time let me show you um you see my\nwhole time let me show you um you see my lock is going crazy when I do it instead\nlock is going crazy when I do it instead\nlock is going crazy when I do it instead I probably recommend you want to use on\nI probably recommend you want to use on\nI probably recommend you want to use on region change uh\nregion change uh\nregion change uh complete that would do put a lock once\ncomplete that would do put a lock once\ncomplete that would do put a lock once when the region Chang actually has\nwhen the region Chang actually has\nwhen the region Chang actually has finished so really when the user is done\nfinished so really when the user is done\nfinished so really when the user is done and then you could maybe calculate I\nand then you could maybe calculate I\nand then you could maybe calculate I don't know new places or display new\ndon't know new places or display new\ndon't know new places or display new markers on the map oh that brings me to\nmarkers on the map oh that brings me to\nmarkers on the map oh that brings me to something yeah that's what I wanted to\nsomething yeah that's what I wanted to\nsomething yeah that's what I wanted to show you as well thank you thank you for\nshow you as well thank you thank you for\nshow you as well thank you thank you for mentioning that so you can of course\nmentioning that so you can of course\nmentioning that so you can of course also display markers on the map that's\nalso display markers on the map that's\nalso display markers on the map that's also a very common thing I have seen um\nalso a very common thing I have seen um\nalso a very common thing I have seen um what you might need to do maybe you want\nwhat you might need to do maybe you want\nwhat you might need to do maybe you want to do like a marathon and you want to\nto do like a marathon and you want to\nto do like a marathon and you want to display some cool uh locations along the\ndisplay some cool uh locations along the\ndisplay some cool uh locations along the view so I've created uh this file here\nview so I've created uh this file here\nview so I've created uh this file here this markers TS with some markers in San\nthis markers TS with some markers in San\nthis markers TS with some markers in San Francisco and some San Diego so just let\nFrancisco and some San Diego so just let\nFrancisco and some San Diego so just let to longit to the usual stuff you know\nto longit to the usual stuff you know\nto longit to the usual stuff you know and let's see how we can display that on\nand let's see how we can display that on\nand let's see how we can display that on our map because again that is just so\nour map because again that is just so\nour map because again that is just so easy it's just so unbelievable easy and\neasy it's just so unbelievable easy and\neasy it's just so unbelievable easy and that's why I wanted to show I actually\nthat's why I wanted to show I actually\nthat's why I wanted to show I actually felt bad about making this video but\nfelt bad about making this video but\nfelt bad about making this video but still I learned this I didn't know it\nstill I learned this I didn't know it\nstill I learned this I didn't know it and then I want to show you so this is\nand then I want to show you so this is\nand then I want to show you so this is like the classic YouTube thing I don't\nlike the classic YouTube thing I don't\nlike the classic YouTube thing I don't know if YouTube will punish me for that\nknow if YouTube will punish me for that\nknow if YouTube will punish me for that but anyway uh I hope this is helpful and\nbut anyway uh I hope this is helpful and\nbut anyway uh I hope this is helpful and and if it is leave up uh leave a thumbs\nand if it is leave up uh leave a thumbs\nand if it is leave up uh leave a thumbs up and of course stay subscribed for\nup and of course stay subscribed for\nup and of course stay subscribed for even more in-depth videos now I have\neven more in-depth videos now I have\neven more in-depth videos now I have changed my map view to have um something\nchanged my map view to have um something\nchanged my map view to have um something inside so now I can iterate my markers I\ninside so now I can iterate my markers I\ninside so now I can iterate my markers I can say markers. map and for every\ncan say markers. map and for every\ncan say markers. map and for every marker and probably I also want the\nmarker and probably I also want the\nmarker and probably I also want the index we can now create our own marker\nindex we can now create our own marker\nindex we can now create our own marker

because I don't really have uh an ID for the marker of course that is not\nID for the marker of course that is not\nID for the marker of course that is not very recommended uh you should use\nvery recommended uh you should use\nvery recommended uh you should use something unique for that additionally\nsomething unique for that additionally\nsomething unique for that additionally we also of course need some coordinates\nwe also of course need some coordinates\nwe also of course need some coordinates and the coordinate should be uh the\nand the coordinate should be uh the\nand the coordinate should be uh the marker I can just I think I can just\nmarker I can just I think I can just\nmarker I can just I think I can just pass in the marker and voila with about\npass in the marker and voila with about\npass in the marker and voila with about yeah well if we say like three lines of\nyeah well if we say like three lines of\nyeah well if we say like three lines of code we now get our markers displayed\ncode we now get our markers displayed\ncode we now get our markers displayed here none of the box I can click on them\nhere none of the box I can click on them\nhere none of the box I can click on them and nothing happens yeah I can I think\nand nothing happens yeah I can I think\nand nothing happens yeah I can I think yeah well with a double click I can of\nyeah well with a double click I can of\nyeah well with a double click I can of course Zoom now if you want to also make\ncourse Zoom now if you want to also make\ncourse Zoom now if you want to also make them a bit more useful you can handle\nthem a bit more useful you can handle\nthem a bit more useful you can handle the Press event on a marker as well so\nthe Press event on a marker as well so\nthe Press event on a marker as well so let's say uh Con on marker\nlet's say uh Con on marker\nlet's say uh Con on marker selected equals marker I will now use\nselected equals marker I will now use\nselected equals marker I will now use any because I don't really have the type\nany because I don't really have the type\nany because I don't really have the type for that and present an alert from react\nfor that and present an alert from react\nfor that and present an alert from react native so alert. alert and then print\nnative so alert. alert and then print\nnative so alert. alert and then print out the marker name now I can pass this\nout the marker name now I can pass this\nout the marker name now I can pass this in and use the on press here of the\nin and use the on press here of the\nin and use the on press here of the marker and let's see\nmarker and let's see\nmarker and let's see I click this and I get nothing uh I\nI click this and I get nothing uh I\nI click this and I get nothing uh I click this and I get nothing why am I\nclick this and I get nothing why am I\nclick this and I get nothing why am I not getting anything uh let's try and do\nnot getting anything uh let's try and do\nnot getting anything uh let's try and do a\na\na Reload uh still nothing is it marker oh\nReload uh still nothing is it marker oh\nReload uh still nothing is it marker oh yeah we need to pass that to onm marker\nyeah we need to pass that to onm marker\nyeah we need to pass that to onm marker selected right uh so UNM marker selected\nselected right uh so UNM marker selected\nselected right uh so UNM marker selected get the actual marker and with that boom\nget the actual marker and with that boom\nget the actual marker and with that boom we can do this in a better way oh no\nwe can do this in a better way oh no\nwe can do this in a better way oh no this is like going I hate it when my map\nthis is like going I hate it when my map\nthis is like going I hate it when my map turns you can actually disabled this\nturns you can actually disabled this\nturns you can actually disabled this with a settings as well so now I can\nwith a settings as well so now I can\nwith a settings as well so now I can click on my markers you can also change\nclick on my markers you can also change\nclick on my markers you can also change the appearance of a marker or what you\nthe appearance of a marker or what you\nthe appearance of a marker or what you maybe want is also a call out so we can\nmaybe want is also a call out so we can\nmaybe want is also a call out so we can dive deeper we have now nested markers\ndive deeper we have now nested markers\ndive deeper we have now nested markers inside the map but inside that marker uh\ninside the map but inside that marker uh\ninside the map but inside that marker uh let's see I want to do this with a new\nlet's see I want to do this with a new\nlet's see I want to do this with a new line inside that marker I will move the\nline inside that marker I will move the\nline inside that marker I will move the closing bracket here uh I will place a\nclosing bracket here uh I will place a\nclosing bracket here uh I will place a call out so that is the little wide view\ncall out so that is the little wide view\ncall out so that is the little wide view above the marker we can once again have\nabove the marker we can once again have\nabove the marker we can once again have something like an onpress event here of\nsomething like an onpress event here of\nsomething like an onpress event here of that call out and in that view you can\nthat call out and in that view you can\nthat call out and in that view you can actually have your own styling like I\nactually have your own styling like I\nactually have your own styling like I can say\ncan say\ncan say padding pading 10 yeah that's not\npadding pading 10 yeah that's not\npadding pading 10 yeah that's not something and then text uh Simon all\nsomething and then text uh Simon all\nsomething and then text uh Simon all right if I do it let's remove that if I\nright if I do it let's remove that if I\nright if I do it let's remove that if I do it like this we see up here and I\ndo it like this we see up here and I\ndo it like this we see up here and I probably you probably don't want to have\nprobably you probably don't want to have\nprobably you probably don't want to have like an onpress for the marker and also\nlike an onpress for the marker and also\nlike an onpress for the marker and also for the call out I think that's probably\nfor the call out I think that's probably\nfor the call out I think that's probably not a good idea here now we see I get\nnot a good idea here now we see I get\nnot a good idea here now we see I get this cool little popup and of course I\nthis cool little popup and of course I\nthis cool little popup and of course I could also just instead run like change\ncould also just instead run like change\ncould also just instead run like change the text font size or uh use the marker.\nthe text font size or uh use the marker.\nthe text font size or uh use the marker. name in here again and if I then click\nname in here again and if I then click\nname in here again and if I then click on the marker it would show the\non the marker it would show the\non the marker it would show the information and you could just create\ninformation and you could just create\ninformation and you could just create your own little call out and again the\nyour own little call out and again the\nyour own little call out and again the call out could also be pressed so if you\ncall out could also be pressed so if you\ncall out could also be pressed so if you want to press the call out just do\nwant to press the call out just do\nwant to press the call out just do another function call out pressed and\nanother function call out pressed and\nanother function call out pressed and then on the call out on pressed it's as\nthen on the call out on pressed it's as\nthen on the call out on pressed it's as easy as that let's see wondering I do\neasy as that let's see wondering I do\neasy as that let's see wondering I do actually put out a lock right yeah so if\nactually put out a lock right yeah so if\nactually put out a lock right yeah so if I click a marker or click this we can\nI click a marker or click this we can\nI click a marker or click this we can see this huge object here uh with all\nsee this huge object here uh with all\nsee this huge object here uh with all the information from actually not just\nthe

It's fully native and takes advantage of\nfully native and takes advantage of\nfully native and takes advantage of platform specific features to give you a\nplatform specific features to give you a\nplatform specific features to give you a powerful and smooth maps experience in\npowerful and smooth maps experience in\npowerful and smooth maps experience in your Expo app. We're going to cover\nyour Expo app. We're going to cover\nyour Expo app. We're going to cover everything you need to get started. How\neverything you need to get started. How\neverything you need to get started. How to install Expo Maps, set up your API\nto install Expo Maps, set up your API\nto install Expo Maps, set up your API key for Android, control the camera, and\nkey for Android, control the camera, and\nkey for Android, control the camera, and move around the map. Add markers,\nmove around the map. Add markers,\nmove around the map. Add markers, annotations, and poly lines for routes,\nannotations, and poly lines for routes,\nannotations, and poly lines for routes, customize map properties, and handle map\ncustomize map properties, and handle map\ncustomize map properties, and handle map events. By the end, you'll have a solid\nevents. By the end, you'll have a solid\nevents. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use Expo Maps.\nunderstanding of how to use Expo Maps.\nunderstanding of how to use Expo Maps. By the way, at the time that I'm\nBy the way, at the time that I'm\nBy the way, at the time that I'm recording this video, Expo Maps is in\nrecording this video, Expo Maps is in\nrecording this video, Expo Maps is in beta, but I'm pretty sure that is going\nbeta, but I'm pretty sure that is going\nbeta, but I'm pretty sure that is going to be available for production pretty\nto be available for production pretty\nto be available for production pretty soon, so you can start implementing now.\nsoon, so you can start implementing now.\nsoon, so you can start implementing now. Let's jump\nLet's jump\nLet's jump [Music]\nin. Okay, so let's see the demo. When\nin. Okay, so let's see the demo. When I'm working on native modules, I like to\nI'm working on native modules, I like to\nI'm working on native modules, I like to test this on real devices. So, I have\ntest this on real devices. So, I have\ntest this on real devices. So, I have here my real iPhone and my Android\nhere my real iPhone and my Android\nhere my real iPhone and my Android device. So, here's a demo on iOS. You\ndevice. So, here's a demo on iOS. You\ndevice. So, here's a demo on iOS. You can, you know, move around, zoom in.\ncan, you know, move around, zoom in.\ncan, you know, move around, zoom in. We're going to learn how to add those\nWe're going to learn how to add those\nWe're going to learn how to add those annotations that you can see on screen.\nannotations that you can see on screen.\nannotations that you can see on screen. What is really nice about using the\nWhat is really nice about using the\nWhat is really nice about using the native implementation is that, for\nnative implementation is that, for\nnative implementation is that, for example, on iOS, I can do my two fingers\nexample, on iOS, I can do my two fingers\nexample, on iOS, I can do my two fingers and drag up to enter into the 3D mode.\nand drag up to enter into the 3D mode.\nand drag up to enter into the 3D mode. And this is how it looks. Looks amazing.\nAnd this is how it looks. Looks amazing.\nAnd this is how it looks. Looks amazing. This is actually an annotation that I\nThis is actually an annotation that I\nThis is actually an annotation that I added. And I can select it. Then we can\nadded. And I can select it. Then we can\nadded. And I can select it. Then we can also move between locations. So I have\nalso move between locations. So I have\nalso move between locations. So I have this previews and next button. So if I\nthis previews and next button. So if I\nthis previews and next button. So if I do next and previews, we have this\ndo next and previews, we have this\ndo next and previews, we have this really nice transition between locations\nreally nice transition between locations\nreally nice transition between locations using a reference. We're going to learn\nusing a reference. We're going to learn\nusing a reference. We're going to learn how to do that. Let's see how this looks\nhow to do that. Let's see how this looks\nhow to do that. Let's see how this looks on Android. If I press next and\non Android. If I press next and\non Android. If I press next and previews, the transition is a bit\npreviews, the transition is a bit\npreviews, the transition is a bit faster, but still looks good. I can also\nfaster, but still looks good. I can also\nfaster, but still looks good. I can also move around, zoom in with my two\nmove around, zoom in with my two\nmove around, zoom in with my two fingers. And they also have this\nfingers. And they also have this\nfingers. And they also have this property to kind of do the 3D thing if\nproperty to kind of do the 3D thing if\nproperty to kind of do the 3D thing if you do two fingers and swipe up. So this\nyou do two fingers and swipe up. So this\nyou do two fingers and swipe up. So this is a custom annotation that we can do as\nis a custom annotation that we can do as\nis a custom annotation that we can do as well. Uh passing like a title and\nwell. Uh passing like a title and\nwell. Uh passing like a title and description and a custom image. As you\ndescription and a custom image. As you\ndescription and a custom image. As you notice here, it's just an image that I\nnotice here, it's just an image that I\nnotice here, it's just an image that I added. It is also possible to change the\nadded. It is also possible to change the\nadded. It is also possible to change the type of map that you are looking into.\ntype of map that you are looking into.\ntype of map that you are looking into. It's also possible to draw all the\nIt's also possible to draw all the\nIt's also possible to draw all the lines. as you notice here have this\nlines. as you notice here have this\nlines. as you notice here have this route between this place and also if you\nroute between this place and also if you\nroute between this place and also if you if you press on a location by default we\nif you press on a location by default we\nif you press on a location by default we we get some information and you can turn\nwe get some information and you can turn\nwe get some information and you can turn this off if you want to um but yeah so\nthis off if you want to um but yeah so\nthis off if you want to um but yeah so far if I press anywhere it gives me the\nfar if I press anywhere it gives me the\nfar if I press anywhere it gives me the coordinates and the location information\ncoordinates and the location information\ncoordinates and the location information and we can do the same for Android let\nand we can do the same for Android let\nand we can do the same for Android let me show you by the way on Android I'm\nme show you by the way on Android I'm\nme show you by the way on Android I'm showing the traffic as you notice there\nshowing the traffic as you notice there\nshowing the traffic as you notice there you can turn that off as well I want to\nyou can turn that off as well I want to\nyou can turn that off as well I want to show you the poly line on Android in\nshow you the poly line on Android in\nshow you the poly line on Android in this case it's thread and I can go to\nthis case it's thread and I can go to\nthis case it's thread and I can go to the next location as well. And this is\nthe next location as well. And this is\nthe next location as well. And this is going to bring me back to Vancouver. So\ngoing to bring me back to Vancouver. So\ngoing to bring me back to Vancouver. So that's a quick demo. We're also going to\nthat's a quick demo. We're also going to\nthat's a quick demo. We're also going to cover how to set up the credentials API\ncover how to set up the credentials API\ncover how to set up the credentials API keys, enable Google Maps for Android,\nkeys, enable Google Maps for Android,\nkeys, enable Google Maps for Android, and also how to get the events on the\nand also how to get the events on the\nand also how to get the events on the map. Let's dive in. A couple things to\nmap. Let's dive in. A couple things to\nmap. Let's dive in. A couple things to notice before we jump into implementing\nnotice before we jump into implementing\nnotice before we jump into implementing this is that you're going to need to\nthis is that you're going to need to\nthis is that you're going to need to have a Google Cloud account for Android.\nhave a Google Cloud account for Android.\nhave a Google Cloud account for Android. So let's go ahead and do that as the\nSo let's go ahead and do that as the\nSo let's go ahead and do that as the first step. If you don't have a Google\nfirst step. If you don't have a Google\nfirst step. If you don't have a Google Cloud account, just go ahead and create\nCloud account, just go ahead and create\nCloud account, just go ahead and create one. And then I'm going to search for\none. And then I'm going to search for\none. And then I'm going to search for Google Maps SDK for Android. So let's go\nGoogle Maps SDK for Android. So let's go\nGoogle Maps SDK for Android. So let's go ahead and select the first one. As you\nahead and select the first one. As you\nahead and select the first one. As you notice, I already enabled this one. So\nnotice, I already enabled this one. So\nnotice, I already enabled this one. So to show you how this looks, I changed\nto show you how this looks, I changed\nto show you how this looks, I changed the project for my chat app and I'm\nthe project for my chat app and I'm\nthe project for my chat app and I'm going to press enable API. Just like\ngoing to press enable API. Just like\ngoing to press enable API. Just like that, we have our API key. The next\nthat, we have our API key. The next\nthat, we have our API key. The next thing is just press this button. I'm\nthing is just press this button. I'm\nthing is just press this button. I'm going to select that this API key can\ngoing to select that this API key can\ngoing to select that this API key can only be used for Android devices and\nonly be used for Android devices and\nonly be used for Android devices and specifically with my package. So in\nspecifically with my package. So in\nspecifically with my package. So in order to get your package as well as the\norder to get your package as well as the\norder to get your package as well as the SHA1 certificate fingerprint, we need to\nSHA1 certificate fingerprint, we need to\nSHA1 certificate fingerprint, we need to build our application. If you already\nbuild our application. If you already\nbuild our application. If you already have your application in Google Play,\nhave your application in Google Play,\nhave your application in Google Play, you can grab the SHA from the Google\nyou can grab the SHA from the Google\nyou can grab the SHA from the Google Play console. But if you are just\nPlay console. But if you are just\nPlay console. But if you are just developing like me, you actually get a\ndeveloping like me, you actually get a\ndeveloping like me, you actually get a debug SHA certificate when you build\ndebug SHA certificate when you build\ndebug SHA certificate when you build your application. So let's build our\nyour application. So let's build our\nyour application. So let's build our application. The first thing that I want\napplication. The first thing that I want\napplication. The first thing that I want to do is install Expo Maps. So let's\nto do is install Expo Maps. So let's\nto do is install Expo Maps. So let's come back here, copy this, paste it in\ncome back here, copy this, paste it in\ncome back here, copy this, paste it in here, and hit enter. Then I'm going to\nhere, and hit enter. Then I'm going to\nhere, and hit enter. Then I'm going to install as well expo image. And this is\ninstall as well expo image. And this is\ninstall as well expo image. And this is specifically to use a custom image to\nspecifically to use a custom image to\nspecifically to use a custom image to show a location. There is one more thing\nshow a location. There is one more thing\nshow a location. There is one more thing that we need to do before building our\nthat we need to do before building our\nthat we need to do before building our application and it's going to be\napplication and it's going to be\napplication and it's going to be configure the expo maps plugin. So let's\nconfigure the expo maps plugin. So let's\nconfigure the expo maps plugin. So let's go to the app JSON and inside this expo\ngo to the app JSON and inside this expo\ngo to the app JSON and inside this expo maps we need to specify some permissions\nmaps we need to specify some permissions\nmaps we need to specify some permissions that we're going to be using as well as\nthat we're going to be using as well as\nthat we're going to be using as well as the API key for Android. So let's copy\nthe API key for Android. So let's copy\nthe API key for Android. So let's copy this piece of code of the example for\nthis piece of code of the example for\nthis piece of code of the example for the plug-in and I'm going to replace\nthe plug-in and I'm going to replace\nthe plug-in and I'm going to replace this. We need permissions to use the\nthis. We need permissions to use the\nthis. We need permissions to use the map. So we need to specify this request\nmap. So we need to specify this request\nmap. So we need to specify this request location permission and location\nlocation permission and location\nlocation permission and location permission. Feel free to customize this\npermission. Feel free to customize this\npermission. Feel free to customize this message depending on the usage of your\nmessage depending on the usage of your\nmessage depending on the usage of your application. In the Android section,\napplication. In the Android section,\napplication. In the Android section, let's type config Google maps and then\nlet's type config Google maps and then\nlet's type config Google maps and then let's pass the API key. Now since I'm\nlet's pass the API key. Now since I'm\nlet's pass the API key. Now since I'm restricting the access of this API key\nrestricting the access of this API key\nrestricting the access of this API key only to my specific Android application\nonly to my specific Android application\nonly to my specific Android application based on the package and the SHA, this\nbased on the package and the SHA, this\nbased on the package and the SHA, this assures that no one else is going to use\nassures that no one else is going to use\nassures that no one else is going to use this API key. Once we configure the expo\nthis API key. Once we configure the expo\nthis API key. Once we configure the expo maps and the API key for Android, we can\nmaps and the API key for Android, we can\nmaps and the API key for Android, we can create a new build on EAS. So I'm going\ncreate a new build on EAS. So I'm going\ncreate a new build on EAS. So I'm going to say EAS build platform Android and\nto say EAS build platform Android and\nto say EAS build platform Android and then profile development and the build\nthen profile development and the build\nthen profile development and the build is in progress. Let's go to the EAS\nis in progress. Let's go to the EAS\nis in progress. Let's go to the EAS dashboard. Now I have this maps tutorial\ndashboard. Now I have this maps tutorial\ndashboard. Now I have this maps tutorial project and I can see that the Android\nproject and I can see that the Android\nproject and I can see that the Android build is in progress. The important part\nbuild is in progress. The important part\nbuild is in progress. The important part here is that if you scroll down, you'll\nhere is that if you scroll down, you'll\nhere is that if you scroll down, you'll find this credentials section and we\nfind this credentials section and we\nfind this credentials section and we have now credentials for Android since\nhave now credentials for Android since\nhave now credentials for Android since we created this build, right? So, this\nwe created this build, right? So, this\nwe created this build, right? So, this is where you can find the\nis where you can find the\nis where you can find the SHA1 fingerprint. Let's copy this. Let's\nSHA1 fingerprint. Let's copy this. Let's\nSHA1 fingerprint. Let's copy this. Let's go back to Google and let's paste this\ngo back to Google and let's paste this\ngo back to Google and let's paste this in here. Paste it in here. This is going\nin here. Paste it in here. This is going\nin here. Paste it in here. This is going to ensure that only our application can\nto ensure that only our application can\nto ensure that only our application can use this API key. Now, I'm going to say\nuse this API key. Now, I'm going to say\nuse this API key. Now, I'm going to say restrict key. Hit save. And that's it.\nrestrict key. Hit save. And that's it.\nrestrict key. Hit save. And that's it. That's all the configuration that we\nThat's all the configuration that we\nThat's all the configuration that we need to do. I'm going to copy this if\nneed to do. I'm going to copy this if\nneed to do. I'm going to copy this if statement. Okay, this is how my index\nstatement. Okay, this is how my index\nstatement. Okay, this is how my index screen looks like. I'm going to open a\nscreen looks like. I'm going to open a\nscreen looks like. I'm going to open a new terminal. I'm going to per build for\nnew terminal. I'm going to per build for\nnew terminal. I'm going to per build for iOS. Now, let's run this on the\niOS. Now, let's run this on the\niOS. Now, let's run this on the simulator by saying MPX expo run iOS.\nsimulator by saying MPX expo run iOS.\nsimulator by saying MPX expo run iOS. So, usually when you are working with a\nSo, usually when you are working with a\nSo, usually when you are working with a map, you're going to get data from an\nmap, you're going to get data from an\nmap, you're going to get data from an API, either Google directions or\nAPI, either Google directions or\nAPI, either Google directions or somewhere else from the database. And\nsomewhere else from the database. And\nsomewhere else from the database. And for now, I'm going to be using just this\nfor now, I'm going to be using just this\nfor now, I'm going to be using just this array of locations. So, this is a simple\narray of locations. So, this is a simple\narray of locations. So, this is a simple array. And if you want to use it, you\narray. And if you want to use it, you\narray. And if you want to use it, you can find it in the repo. My build is\ncan find it in the repo. My build is\ncan find it in the repo. My build is ready. So let's open it. So just like\nready. So let's open it. So just like\nready. So let's open it. So just like that, we are able to view the map. Now\nthat, we are able to view the map. Now\nthat, we are able to view the map. Now notice that uh we have actually two\nnotice that uh we have actually two\nnotice that uh we have actually two components. One is going to be for Apple\ncomponents. One is going to be for Apple\ncomponents. One is going to be for Apple and the other one for Android. This is\nand the other one for Android. This is\nand the other one for Android. This is because the implementation of Expo maps,\nbecause the implementation of Expo maps,\nbecause the implementation of Expo maps, it's fully native. This also means that\nit's fully native. This also means that\nit's fully native. This also means that we have different properties depending\nwe have different properties depending\nwe have different properties depending on the platform and you can learn more\non the platform and you can learn more\non the platform and you can learn more about that in here in the docs. So here\nabout that in here in the docs. So here\nabout that in here in the docs. So here we have all the components and\nwe have all the components and\nwe have all the components and properties available for iOS and for\nproperties available for iOS and for\nproperties available for iOS and for Google Maps. For Android, the list is\nGoogle Maps. For Android, the list is\nGoogle Maps. For Android, the list is actually a bit longer, which is nice.\nactually a bit longer, which is nice.\nactually a bit longer, which is nice. The first property that I want to show\nThe first property that I want to show\nThe first property that I want to show you guys is going to be the camera\nyou guys is going to be the camera\nyou guys is going to be the camera position. This is going to take some\nposition. This is going to take some\nposition. This is going to take some coordinates and zoom level. If I hit\ncoordinates and zoom level. If I hit\ncoordinates and zoom level. If I hit save, suddenly we are in this position.\nsave, suddenly we are in this position.\nsave, suddenly we are in this position. And if I comment it and reload the\nAnd if I comment it and reload the\nAnd if I comment it and reload the application,\napplication,\napplication, um, we are there. That's the default\num, we are there. That's the default\num, we are there. That's the default position. And as soon as I add this\nposition. And as soon as I add this\nposition. And as soon as I add this camera position, it's going to take me\ncamera position, it's going to take me\ncamera position, it's going to take me there. So from here, it's just a matter\nthere. So from here, it's just a matter\nthere. So from here, it's just a matter of playing with the zoom. You can\nof playing with the zoom. You can\nof playing with the zoom. You can either, you know, put it super close or\neither, you know, put it super close or\neither, you know, put it super close or very far. So the zoom is important for,\nvery far. So the zoom is important for,\nvery far. So the zoom is important for, I would say, the first load since the\nI would say, the first load since the\nI would say, the first load since the user can zoom in and zoom out with their\nuser can zoom in and zoom out with their\nuser can zoom in and zoom out with their fingers. Uh, but yeah, still you can\nfingers. Uh, but yeah, still you can\nfingers. Uh, but yeah, still you can play around within one and 21. I think\nplay around within one and 21. I think\nplay around within one and 21. I think it's the max. So if I set this to 21,\nit's the max. So if I set this to 21,\nit's the max. So if I set this to 21, it's going to be super close as you can\nit's going to be super close as you can\nit's going to be super close as you can see there. So I think 10 it's a good\nsee there. So I think 10 it's a good\nsee there. So I think 10 it's a good value. There are some properties that\nvalue. There are some properties that\nvalue. There are some properties that you can share between Apple and Google\nyou can share between Apple and Google\nyou can share between Apple and Google components and the camera position is\ncomponents and the camera position is\ncomponents and the camera position is one of them. So if I take the first item\none of them. So if I take the first item\none of them. So if I take the first item of my location list, I can come here and\nof my location list, I can come here and\nof my location list, I can come here and just share this across Google and\njust share this across Google and\njust share this across Google and Apple. So I have a long list of items.\nApple. So I have a long list of items.\nApple. So I have a long list of items. I'm going to create a variable to store\nI'm going to create a variable to store\nI'm going to create a variable to store the index of the position that we are\nthe index of the position that we are\nthe index of the position that we are currently at. And then we can create\ncurrently at. And then we can create\ncurrently at. And then we can create some controls that allows us to move\nsome controls that allows us to move\nsome controls that allows us to move between the maps and change the\nbetween the maps and change the\nbetween the maps and change the location. So for example, I'm going to\nlocation. So for example, I'm going to\nlocation. So for example, I'm going to add this render map controls function\nadd this render map controls function\nadd this render map controls function that is going to implement a simple view\nthat is going to implement a simple view\nthat is going to implement a simple view and a simple button from React Native.\nand a simple button from React Native.\nand a simple button from React Native. So now we can start adding items inside\nSo now we can start adding items inside\nSo now we can start adding items inside the view of the map. So because we can\nthe view of the map. So because we can\nthe view of the map. So because we can also share that between the Apple and\nalso share that between the Apple and\nalso share that between the Apple and Google maps, I'm going to create this\nGoogle maps, I'm going to create this\nGoogle maps, I'm going to create this function that is just going to render\nfunction that is just going to render\nfunction that is just going to render these two buttons that allow me to\nthese two buttons that allow me to\nthese two buttons that allow me to change the index of the location. And\nchange the index of the location. And\nchange the index of the location. And then instead of hard coding this uh\nthen instead of hard coding this uh\nthen instead of hard coding this uh zero, I can pass the location index of\nzero, I can pass the location index of\nzero, I can pass the location index of this variable and then go to the view\nthis variable and then go to the view\nthis variable and then go to the view and add the controls in here. So this\nand add the controls in here. So this\nand add the controls in here. So this component does not allow to have\ncomponent does not allow to have\ncomponent does not allow to have children inside of it. Um, and this is\nchildren inside of it. Um, and this is\nchildren inside of it. Um, and this is why I'm going to just call my render\nwhy I'm going to just call my render\nwhy I'm going to just call my render controls like this. So, if I hit save,\ncontrols like this. So, if I hit save,\ncontrols like this. So, if I hit save, you notice that something's happening.\nyou notice that something's happening.\nyou notice that something's happening. Uh, this is because the map view is\nUh, this is because the map view is\nUh, this is because the map view is taking the entire space available. And\ntaking the entire space available. And\ntaking the entire space available. And instead of doing this, I want to\ninstead of doing this, I want to\ninstead of doing this, I want to position this in an absolute manner. For\nposition this in an absolute manner. For\nposition this in an absolute manner. For that, we can use the stylesheet absolute\nthat, we can use the stylesheet absolute\nthat, we can use the stylesheet absolute fill and hit save. You can barely see\nfill and hit save. You can barely see\nfill and hit save. You can barely see it, but the controls are down here. And\nit, but the controls are down here. And\nit, but the controls are down here. And actually to prevent that I'm going to\nactually to prevent that I'm going to\nactually to prevent that I'm going to wrap this into a safe area view from\nwrap this into a safe area view from\nwrap this into a safe area view from React Native. And then I'm going to add\nReact Native. And then I'm going to add\nReact Native. And then I'm going to add a padding. Um and the padding is going\na padding. Um and the padding is going\na padding. Um and the padding is going to be the height of the bottom tabs.\nto be the height of the bottom tabs.\nto be the height of the bottom tabs. This is only necessary for iOS. To get\nThis is only necessary for iOS. To get\nThis is only necessary for iOS. To get the bottom height, we can use this hook.\nthe bottom height, we can use this hook.\nthe bottom height, we can use this hook. Uh use bottom tab overflow. This\nUh use bottom tab overflow. This\nUh use bottom tab overflow. This actually comes with the template and\nactually comes with the template and\nactually comes with the template and it's going to give you the height of the\nit's going to give you the height of the\nit's going to give you the height of the bottom tabs basically. Then we can add\nbottom tabs basically. Then we can add\nbottom tabs basically. Then we can add that padding. and it's not entirely\nthat padding. and it's not entirely\nthat padding. and it's not entirely working. This is because I want to\nworking. This is because I want to\nworking. This is because I want to actually use safe area view from React\nactually use safe area view from React\nactually use safe area view from React Native safe area context. Uh that is\nNative safe area context. Uh that is\nNative safe area context. Uh that is going to work a bit better and actually\ngoing to work a bit better and actually\ngoing to work a bit better and actually takes the uh pointer event box none in\ntakes the uh pointer event box none in\ntakes the uh pointer event box none in here. The pointer event box none\nhere. The pointer event box none\nhere. The pointer event box none actually allows me to still use the item\nactually allows me to still use the item\nactually allows me to still use the item behind this view. If I don't provide\nbehind this view. If I don't provide\nbehind this view. If I don't provide this, it's actually going to prevent me\nthis, it's actually going to prevent me\nthis, it's actually going to prevent me from using the map. So this is what the\nfrom using the map. So this is what the\nfrom using the map. So this is what the pointer events are doing in here. And\npointer events are doing in here. And\npointer events are doing in here. And then now we can move between next and\npreviews. Okay, that's how it looks. Now\npreviews. Okay, that's how it looks. Now let's see how this looks on Android. The\nlet's see how this looks on Android. The\nlet's see how this looks on Android. The build is actually ready. So I'm going to\nbuild is actually ready. So I'm going to\nbuild is actually ready. So I'm going to scan this QR code with my Android\nscan this QR code with my Android\nscan this QR code with my Android device. And to show you my Android\ndevice. And to show you my Android\ndevice. And to show you my Android device, here it is. Um, this is actually\ndevice, here it is. Um, this is actually\ndevice, here it is. Um, this is actually going to take me to the Expo build and\ngoing to take me to the Expo build and\ngoing to take me to the Expo build and then I can hit install. This is going to\nthen I can hit install. This is going to\nthen I can hit install. This is going to download the app. I'm going to delete\ndownload the app. I'm going to delete\ndownload the app. I'm going to delete the previous one that I had here. And\nthe previous one that I had here. And\nthe previous one that I had here. And once this is downloaded, I can install\nonce this is downloaded, I can install\nonce this is downloaded, I can install it. Okay, now it's installed. Um, I\nit. Okay, now it's installed. Um, I\nit. Okay, now it's installed. Um, I don't want to actually open it right\ndon't want to actually open it right\ndon't want to actually open it right away. What I want to do is scan the\naway. What I want to do is scan the\naway. What I want to do is scan the server. Since this is a development\nserver. Since this is a development\nserver. Since this is a development build, it needs the server to run. So,\nbuild, it needs the server to run. So,\nbuild, it needs the server to run. So, I'm going to scan this QR code. And this\nI'm going to scan this QR code. And this\nI'm going to scan this QR code. And this is actually going to open it right away.\nis actually going to open it right away.\nis actually going to open it right away. Awesome. And just like that, I'm able to\nAwesome. And just like that, I'm able to\nAwesome. And just like that, I'm able to see the map on Android. Looks and feels\nsee the map on Android. Looks and feels\nsee the map on Android. Looks and feels super nice. I can do my gestures, do my\nsuper nice. I can do my gestures, do my\nsuper nice. I can do my gestures, do my stuff. Awesome. So, we'll come back to\nstuff. Awesome. So, we'll come back to\nstuff. Awesome. So, we'll come back to Android. Let's go back to the\nAndroid. Let's go back to the\nAndroid. Let's go back to the implementation now that we know that\nimplementation now that we know that\nimplementation now that we know that everything is working. So, we don't have\neverything is working. So, we don't have\neverything is working. So, we don't have controls on Android. Let's quickly come\ncontrols on Android. Let's quickly come\ncontrols on Android. Let's quickly come here and copy these controls. Um, and\nhere and copy these controls. Um, and\nhere and copy these controls. Um, and I'm going to, of course, wrap this like\nI'm going to, of course, wrap this like\nI'm going to, of course, wrap this like this. Paste the controls in here. Hit\nthis. Paste the controls in here. Hit\nthis. Paste the controls in here. Hit save. Let's see how this looks. Okay.\nsave. Let's see how this looks. Okay.\nsave. Let's see how this looks. Okay. And we've been through this. The reason\nAnd we've been through this. The reason\nAnd we've been through this. The reason for that is because we need to pass the\nfor that is because we need to pass the\nfor that is because we need to pass the absolute feeling here.\nabsolute feeling here.\nabsolute feeling here. So, let's pass this in here. And now\nSo, let's pass this in here. And now\nSo, let's pass this in here. And now this is how it looks. Uh, and I can move\nthis is how it looks. Uh, and I can move\nthis is how it looks. Uh, and I can move between locations. Awesome. So, we don't\nbetween locations. Awesome. So, we don't\nbetween locations. Awesome. So, we don't have like a nice transition between\nhave like a nice transition between\nhave like a nice transition between locations when I'm changing the index.\nlocations when I'm changing the index.\nlocations when I'm changing the index. And we can actually fix that by using a\nAnd we can actually fix that by using a\nAnd we can actually fix that by using a reference instead of hard coding the\nreference instead of hard coding the\nreference instead of hard coding the index. Let's create a reference up here\nindex. Let's create a reference up here\nindex. Let's create a reference up here using ref. And then we can go to the map\nusing ref. And then we can go to the map\nusing ref. And then we can go to the map and add it in here. Uh, I'm going to\nand add it in here. Uh, I'm going to\nand add it in here. Uh, I'm going to need a new reference for Android, I\nneed a new reference for Android, I\nneed a new reference for Android, I think. But once we have this reference,\nthink. But once we have this reference,\nthink. But once we have this reference, we can just set the camera\nwe can just set the camera\nwe can just set the camera position using a helper function like\nposition using a helper function like\nposition using a helper function like this one. So, let me just change this to\nthis one. So, let me just change this to\nthis one. So, let me just change this to be 10. So, what this function is doing\nbe 10. So, what this function is doing\nbe 10. So, what this function is doing is taking the direction, meaning that we\nis taking the direction, meaning that we\nis taking the direction, meaning that we are going to increase or decrease the\nare going to increase or decrease the\nare going to increase or decrease the index, and then we take the next\nindex, and then we take the next\nindex, and then we take the next location and put it in this variable.\nlocation and put it in this variable.\nlocation and put it in this variable. And then instead of setting the user\nAnd then instead of setting the user\nAnd then instead of setting the user state variable with the new location, we\nstate variable with the new location, we\nstate variable with the new location, we pass the reference like this. And then\npass the reference like this. And then\npass the reference like this. And then after the animation, we set the location\nafter the animation, we set the location\nafter the animation, we set the location index. I think there might be a better\nindex. I think there might be a better\nindex. I think there might be a better way to do this, but let's see how we can\nway to do this, but let's see how we can\nway to do this, but let's see how we can do this. Now, instead of setting the\ndo this. Now, instead of setting the\ndo this. Now, instead of setting the location in here, I'm going to uh just\nlocation in here, I'm going to uh just\nlocation in here, I'm going to uh just call this function handle next with ref.\ncall this function handle next with ref.\ncall this function handle next with ref. So, if I press next, now we have this\nSo, if I press next, now we have this\nSo, if I press next, now we have this really nice and smooth. Of course, I am\nreally nice and smooth. Of course, I am\nreally nice and smooth. Of course, I am out of the index there. Uh, but we have\nout of the index there. Uh, but we have\nout of the index there. Uh, but we have this really nice and smooth animation\nthis really nice and smooth animation\nthis really nice and smooth animation that looks like that. The next thing\nthat looks like that. The next thing\nthat looks like that. The next thing that I want to show you are markers. So,\nthat I want to show you are markers. So,\nthat I want to show you are markers. So, Apple Maps and Google Maps take this\nApple Maps and Google Maps take this\nApple Maps and Google Maps take this property markers. And down here, I'm\nproperty markers. And down here, I'm\nproperty markers. And down here, I'm going to create some dummy data or\ngoing to create some dummy data or\ngoing to create some dummy data or hard-coded data, which basically it's an\nhard-coded data, which basically it's an\nhard-coded data, which basically it's an array of objects that are taking just\narray of objects that are taking just\narray of objects that are taking just the first 10 items of my location list.\nthe first 10 items of my location list.\nthe first 10 items of my location list. The reason why I'm doing this is because\nThe reason why I'm doing this is because\nThe reason why I'm doing this is because the Google markers take different\nthe Google markers take different\nthe Google markers take different properties than the Apple markers. So\nproperties than the Apple markers. So\nproperties than the Apple markers. So for example, the Google ones have\nfor example, the Google ones have\nfor example, the Google ones have coordinates, title, snippet, and\ncoordinates, title, snippet, and\ncoordinates, title, snippet, and dragable. So you can drag them on\ndragable. So you can drag them on\ndragable. So you can drag them on Android. But for iOS, uh also it takes\nAndroid. But for iOS, uh also it takes\nAndroid. But for iOS, uh also it takes coordinates, title, but then you can\ncoordinates, title, but then you can\ncoordinates, title, but then you can specify a tint color, which is a native\nspecify a tint color, which is a native\nspecify a tint color, which is a native color that you can specify for this\ncolor that you can specify for this\ncolor that you can specify for this specific marker, and system image. This\nspecific marker, and system image. This\nspecific marker, and system image. This is super nice because you don't have to\nis super nice because you don't have to\nis super nice because you don't have to pass a custom image. you can just use a\npass a custom image. you can just use a\npass a custom image. you can just use a really nice icon that comes with the\nreally nice icon that comes with the\nreally nice icon that comes with the system image for iOS. So once we have\nsystem image for iOS. So once we have\nsystem image for iOS. So once we have this um data in here, we can just come\nthis um data in here, we can just come\nthis um data in here, we can just come here and pass the markers markers Apple\nhere and pass the markers markers Apple\nhere and pass the markers markers Apple and then down here let's pass the\nand then down here let's pass the\nand then down here let's pass the markers Google. So if I hit save, as you\nmarkers Google. So if I hit save, as you\nmarkers Google. So if I hit save, as you notice now we have these really nice\nnotice now we have these really nice\nnotice now we have these really nice markers that are using uh different\nmarkers that are using uh different\nmarkers that are using uh different system images. So the first one for\nsystem images. So the first one for\nsystem images. So the first one for example is the cup and the saucer field.\nexample is the cup and the saucer field.\nexample is the cup and the saucer field. Let's change this to be a fork and knife\nLet's change this to be a fork and knife\nLet's change this to be a fork and knife for example. And you can change the\nfor example. And you can change the\nfor example. And you can change the color to be orange or\ncolor to be orange or\ncolor to be orange or blue,\nred, purple, any color that you want is\nred, purple, any color that you want is going to be available here. For example,\ngoing to be available here. For example,\ngoing to be available here. For example, a person in here. And when you tap on\na person in here. And when you tap on\na person in here. And when you tap on this, it's going to have this really\nthis, it's going to have this really\nthis, it's going to have this really nice native animation without us doing\nnice native animation without us doing\nnice native animation without us doing anything. Let's see how this looks on\nanything. Let's see how this looks on\nanything. Let's see how this looks on Android. Um, here I have my device. And\nAndroid. Um, here I have my device. And\nAndroid. Um, here I have my device. And if I zoom in, this is how it looks\nif I zoom in, this is how it looks\nif I zoom in, this is how it looks because I specified that I can move\nbecause I specified that I can move\nbecause I specified that I can move these pins. I can tap on it and then I'm\nthese pins. I can tap on it and then I'm\nthese pins. I can tap on it and then I'm going to get the title and description\ngoing to get the title and description\ngoing to get the title and description and then I can drag and drop and put it\nand then I can drag and drop and put it\nand then I can drag and drop and put it everywhere. So you can do that. Maybe\neverywhere. So you can do that. Maybe\neverywhere. So you can do that. Maybe the user has you know some route that\nthe user has you know some route that\nthe user has you know some route that they are doing. So they can drag and\nthey are doing. So they can drag and\nthey are doing. So they can drag and drop and you you can get these events as\ndrop and you you can get these events as\ndrop and you you can get these events as well uh on the map. But yeah, that's how\nwell uh on the map. But yeah, that's how\nwell uh on the map. But yeah, that's how it looks. The next thing that I want to\nit looks. The next thing that I want to\nit looks. The next thing that I want to show you are annotations. This is only\nshow you are annotations. This is only\nshow you are annotations. This is only for iOS and annotations can take an\nfor iOS and annotations can take an\nfor iOS and annotations can take an image or not as you can see there. So\nimage or not as you can see there. So\nimage or not as you can see there. So for example, let's take this position\nfor example, let's take this position\nfor example, let's take this position here and we can pass a title and text\nhere and we can pass a title and text\nhere and we can pass a title and text for example expo HQ and if I say test,\nfor example expo HQ and if I say test,\nfor example expo HQ and if I say test, you notice that this is updating. The\nyou notice that this is updating. The\nyou notice that this is updating. The cool thing about annotations on iOS is\ncool thing about annotations on iOS is\ncool thing about annotations on iOS is that you can use an image. So let's use\nthat you can use an image. So let's use\nthat you can use an image. So let's use an image. That's why I actually\nan image. That's why I actually\nan image. That's why I actually installed Expo image at the beginning.\ninstalled Expo image at the beginning.\ninstalled Expo image at the beginning. So let's import that. And for this I'm\nSo let's import that. And for this I'm\nSo let's import that. And for this I'm just going to use a link from the\njust going to use a link from the\njust going to use a link from the internet. This is how it looks. You can\ninternet. This is how it looks. You can\ninternet. This is how it looks. You can pass an an error function in case\npass an an error function in case\npass an an error function in case something is wrong. But then I can use\nsomething is wrong. But then I can use\nsomething is wrong. But then I can use this image down here in the icon\nthis image down here in the icon\nthis image down here in the icon property. So if I hit save now, we are\nproperty. So if I hit save now, we are\nproperty. So if I hit save now, we are able to see um the image. Of course, at\nable to see um the image. Of course, at\nable to see um the image. Of course, at this point, maybe you don't want to add\nthis point, maybe you don't want to add\nthis point, maybe you don't want to add the um sorry the text, but you can still\nthe um sorry the text, but you can still\nthe um sorry the text, but you can still have the description. You can see it\nhave the description. You can see it\nhave the description. You can see it here. Of course, maybe at this point you\nhere. Of course, maybe at this point you\nhere. Of course, maybe at this point you don't want to have this marker for the\ndon't want to have this marker for the\ndon't want to have this marker for the first item so that we only have the\nfirst item so that we only have the\nfirst item so that we only have the image uh of Expo HQ. And as you might\nimage uh of Expo HQ. And as you might\nimage uh of Expo HQ. And as you might imagine guys, you can have many more. So\nimagine guys, you can have many more. So\nimagine guys, you can have many more. So in this case, you can just change the um\nin this case, you can just change the um\nin this case, you can just change the um latitude and longitude and change the\nlatitude and longitude and change the\nlatitude and longitude and change the image and this would be the result. So\nimage and this would be the result. So\nimage and this would be the result. So those are annotations only for iOS. When\nthose are annotations only for iOS. When\nthose are annotations only for iOS. When we are working with maps, especially if\nwe are working with maps, especially if\nwe are working with maps, especially if you're doing something that requires\nyou're doing something that requires\nyou're doing something that requires giving the user directions to go from\ngiving the user directions to go from\ngiving the user directions to go from one place to another or track the\none place to another or track the\none place to another or track the location for for of someone, in that\nlocation for for of someone, in that\nlocation for for of someone, in that case, you can use poly lines. Poly lines\ncase, you can use poly lines. Poly lines\ncase, you can use poly lines. Poly lines are basically lines of a specific color\nare basically lines of a specific color\nare basically lines of a specific color from one coordinate to another\nfrom one coordinate to another\nfrom one coordinate to another coordinate. And you can specify the\ncoordinate. And you can specify the\ncoordinate. And you can specify the width and the color and the coordinates.\nwidth and the color and the coordinates.\nwidth and the color and the coordinates. In this example, we have these array\nIn this example, we have these array\nIn this example, we have these array polyline coordinates. In most cases, of\npolyline coordinates. In most cases, of\npolyline coordinates. In most cases, of course, you won't be using hard-coded\ncourse, you won't be using hard-coded\ncourse, you won't be using hard-coded data for poly lines. You can use APIs\ndata for poly lines. You can use APIs\ndata for poly lines. You can use APIs like Google directions to get this data\nlike Google directions to get this data\nlike Google directions to get this data in real time. Even you can have multiple\nin real time. Even you can have multiple\nin real time. Even you can have multiple routes and change them and draw them on\nroutes and change them and draw them on\nroutes and change them and draw them on the map with more detail. But the\nthe map with more detail. But the\nthe map with more detail. But the important part here is that you can\nimportant part here is that you can\nimportant part here is that you can change the look and feel. So, for\nchange the look and feel. So, for\nchange the look and feel. So, for example, you can change this to be\nexample, you can change this to be\nexample, you can change this to be white and then the width 10.\nwhite and then the width 10.\nwhite and then the width 10. Maybe just\nMaybe just\nMaybe just one, maybe 20. Let's check this out on\none, maybe 20. Let's check this out on\none, maybe 20. Let's check this out on Android. You can also have poly lines.\nAndroid. You can also have poly lines.\nAndroid. You can also have poly lines. Let's hit save. Let's go to the Android\nLet's hit save. Let's go to the Android\nLet's hit save. Let's go to the Android one. And that's how it looks. So poly\none. And that's how it looks. So poly\none. And that's how it looks. So poly lines, it's another property that we can\nlines, it's another property that we can\nlines, it's another property that we can share between Google and Apple Map. The\nshare between Google and Apple Map. The\nshare between Google and Apple Map. The next thing that I want to show you, it's\nnext thing that I want to show you, it's\nnext thing that I want to show you, it's going to be map properties. So you can\ngoing to be map properties. So you can\ngoing to be map properties. So you can specify the type of map for your user by\nspecify the type of map for your user by\nspecify the type of map for your user by importing this Apple maps type. So we\nimporting this Apple maps type. So we\nimporting this Apple maps type. So we have the standard which is what you're\nhave the standard which is what you're\nhave the standard which is what you're seeing right now. We also have hybrid uh\nseeing right now. We also have hybrid uh\nseeing right now. We also have hybrid uh which is you know like a the real world\nwhich is you know like a the real world\nwhich is you know like a the real world picture of how it looks from the sky.\npicture of how it looks from the sky.\npicture of how it looks from the sky. And then we also have imagery. So this\nAnd then we also have imagery. So this\nAnd then we also have imagery. So this looks pretty nice and it might be\nlooks pretty nice and it might be\nlooks pretty nice and it might be something that you need for your\nsomething that you need for your\nsomething that you need for your application. You can enable traffic just\napplication. You can enable traffic just\napplication. You can enable traffic just by passing this flag and selection\nby passing this flag and selection\nby passing this flag and selection enable equal to true or false. And if\nenable equal to true or false. And if\nenable equal to true or false. And if you want to learn more about these\nyou want to learn more about these\nyou want to learn more about these properties, you can just go to the docs\nproperties, you can just go to the docs\nproperties, you can just go to the docs or hover here. If true, the user can\nor hover here. If true, the user can\nor hover here. If true, the user can select a location on the map to get more\nselect a location on the map to get more\nselect a location on the map to get more information. In this case, I don't want\ninformation. In this case, I don't want\ninformation. In this case, I don't want to allow that. Meaning that if the user\nto allow that. Meaning that if the user\nto allow that. Meaning that if the user presses, nothing is going to happen. So\npresses, nothing is going to happen. So\npresses, nothing is going to happen. So map properties on Google maps, uh, we\nmap properties on Google maps, uh, we\nmap properties on Google maps, uh, we actually have extra properties, which is\nactually have extra properties, which is\nactually have extra properties, which is nice. For example, we have is building\nnice. For example, we have is building\nnice. For example, we have is building enabled, is indoor enabled, map type. We\nenabled, is indoor enabled, map type. We\nenabled, is indoor enabled, map type. We also have more map types like hybrid,\nalso have more map types like hybrid,\nalso have more map types like hybrid, normal, satellite, terrain. Let's check\nnormal, satellite, terrain. Let's check\nnormal, satellite, terrain. Let's check out the satellite. And let's check the\nout the satellite. And let's check the\nout the satellite. And let's check the Android device. That's how it looks. I\nAndroid device. That's how it looks. I\nAndroid device. That's how it looks. I have the um traffic enabled. So, if I\nhave the um traffic enabled. So, if I\nhave the um traffic enabled. So, if I turn this to\nturn this to\nturn this to false and go back now, we don't see the\nfalse and go back now, we don't see the\nfalse and go back now, we don't see the traffic, which you might want to do\ntraffic, which you might want to do\ntraffic, which you might want to do that. Let's check out the\nthat. Let's check out the\nthat. Let's check out the terrain. That's terrain. Let's say\nhybrid. Pretty similar to the first one,\nhybrid. Pretty similar to the first one, I think. Another important thing about\nI think. Another important thing about\nI think. Another important thing about Android is that you can set the min and\nAndroid is that you can set the min and\nAndroid is that you can set the min and max zoom preference. So we can set it\nmax zoom preference. So we can set it\nmax zoom preference. So we can set it between you know one and 20. So these\nbetween you know one and 20. So these\nbetween you know one and 20. So these properties are nice to have you know in\nproperties are nice to have you know in\nproperties are nice to have you know in case you need you know prevent the user\ncase you need you know prevent the user\ncase you need you know prevent the user from extra zooming in or zooming out. Uh\nfrom extra zooming in or zooming out. Uh\nfrom extra zooming in or zooming out. Uh you can pass these properties. Finally\nyou can pass these properties. Finally\nyou can pass these properties. Finally guys the most important part I would say\nguys the most important part I would say\nguys the most important part I would say to add that dynamic field of your map is\nto add that dynamic field of your map is\nto add that dynamic field of your map is going to be uh the events of the map. So\ngoing to be uh the events of the map. So\ngoing to be uh the events of the map. So for Apple Maps we can pass the on map\nfor Apple Maps we can pass the on map\nfor Apple Maps we can pass the on map click on map on marker click on camera\nclick on map on marker click on camera\nclick on map on marker click on camera move and if I open the terminal for\nmove and if I open the terminal for\nmove and if I open the terminal for example let's check out the on map click\nexample let's check out the on map click\nexample let's check out the on map click when I press on the map as you notice we\nwhen I press on the map as you notice we\nwhen I press on the map as you notice we are getting the event with the latitude\nare getting the event with the latitude\nare getting the event with the latitude and longitude and the target of this\nand longitude and the target of this\nand longitude and the target of this location. So if I press this marker,\nlocation. So if I press this marker,\nlocation. So if I press this marker, this is the event that we get. When I\nthis is the event that we get. When I\nthis is the event that we get. When I move the camera and I release, once the\nmove the camera and I release, once the\nmove the camera and I release, once the camera stops, we get the location of\ncamera stops, we get the location of\ncamera stops, we get the location of where we stopped. So for Android, we\nwhere we stopped. So for Android, we\nwhere we stopped. So for Android, we actually have more events at the time\nactually have more events at the time\nactually have more events at the time that I'm recording this video. Um, so we\nthat I'm recording this video. Um, so we\nthat I'm recording this video. Um, so we have for example the on polyline click.\nhave for example the on polyline click.\nhave for example the on polyline click. So let's open the terminal and let's go\nSo let's open the terminal and let's go\nSo let's open the terminal and let's go one by one on my Android device. Let me\none by one on my Android device. Let me\none by one on my Android device. Let me try to press on the poly line. Yeah, and\ntry to press on the poly line. Yeah, and\ntry to press on the poly line. Yeah, and I got the alert with the information.\nI got the alert with the information.\nI got the alert with the information. And we also have the console log with\nAnd we also have the console log with\nAnd we also have the console log with the event. Pretty similar to iOS. We\nthe event. Pretty similar to iOS. We\nthe event. Pretty similar to iOS. We have the latitude and longitude. We also\nhave the latitude and longitude. We also\nhave the latitude and longitude. We also have on map loaded. Maybe you need to do\nhave on map loaded. Maybe you need to do\nhave on map loaded. Maybe you need to do something when the map\nsomething when the map\nsomething when the map loads on map click. Let's try to check\nloads on map click. Let's try to check\nloads on map click. Let's try to check this one out. I'm just going to press\nthis one out. I'm just going to press\nthis one out.

to\nsyntax now first of all I want to talk\nsyntax now first of all I want to talk about how these map libraries actually\nabout how these map libraries actually\nabout how these map libraries actually work and so when you visit a webp page\nwork and so when you visit a webp page\nwork and so when you visit a webp page that has an interactive map on it like\nthat has an interactive map on it like\nthat has an interactive map on it like this the first thing that needs to\nthis the first thing that needs to\nthis the first thing that needs to happen is the browser is going to load a\nhappen is the browser is going to load a\nhappen is the browser is going to load a JavaScript live library that is actually\nJavaScript live library that is actually\nJavaScript live library that is actually used to display the map and so for this\nused to display the map and so for this\nused to display the map and so for this example I have a react application and\nexample I have a react application and\nexample I have a react application and it's using map Libre and also the vigl\nit's using map Libre and also the vigl\nit's using map Libre and also the vigl rapper library of map Libra but you'll\nrapper library of map Libra but you'll\nrapper library of map Libra but you'll see in the network tab here that it\nsee in the network tab here that it\nsee in the network tab here that it loaded those files in but because these\nloaded those files in but because these\nloaded those files in but because these packages can be installed from mpm I\npackages can be installed from mpm I\npackages can be installed from mpm I didn't have to hit any external server\ndidn't have to hit any external server\ndidn't have to hit any external server these are actually just loaded from the\nthese are actually just loaded from the\nthese are actually just loaded from the V Dev server that's serving up the\nV Dev server that's serving up the\nV Dev server that's serving up the application so that's step one it loaded\napplication so that's step one it loaded\napplication so that's step one it loaded in the JavaScript and now we can\nin the JavaScript and now we can\nin the JavaScript and now we can actually have an interactive map now\nactually have an interactive map now\nactually have an interactive map now step two is this library now needs to\nstep two is this library now needs to\nstep two is this library now needs to request tiles or vectors based on what\nrequest tiles or vectors based on what\nrequest tiles or vectors based on what the user is viewing and those tiles and\nthe user is viewing and those tiles and\nthe user is viewing and those tiles and vectors are requested from a map tile\nvectors are requested from a map tile\nvectors are requested from a map tile server so you'll see here as I navigate\nserver so you'll see here as I navigate\nserver so you'll see here as I navigate around if I reach a part of the map or a\naround if I reach a part of the map or a\naround if I reach a part of the map or a zoom level that I have not seen before\nzoom level that I have not seen before\nzoom level that I have not seen before some requests get fired off and these\nsome requests get fired off and these\nsome requests get fired off and these are requests for the actual vectors that\nare requests for the actual vectors that\nare requests for the actual vectors that describe these various parts of the map\ndescribe these various parts of the map\ndescribe these various parts of the map that I'm looking at you can see all\nthat I'm looking at you can see all\nthat I'm looking at you can see all these requests being fired off but if I\nthese requests being fired off but if I\nthese requests being fired off but if I hover over them you can see the request\nhover over them you can see the request\nhover over them you can see the request is being made to tiles. openen free.org\nis being made to tiles. openen free.org\nis being made to tiles. openen free.org so this is the free tile server that\nso this is the free tile server that\nso this is the free tile server that open free map provides that essentially\nopen free map provides that essentially\nopen free map provides that essentially gives us this data about the map and so\ngives us this data about the map and so\ngives us this data about the map and so the JavaScript library gets these Vector\nthe JavaScript library gets these Vector\nthe JavaScript library gets these Vector files back and then actually renders\nfiles back and then actually renders\nfiles back and then actually renders them onto the page now in this specific\nthem onto the page now in this specific\nthem onto the page now in this specific example we're using Vector tiles so if\nexample we're using Vector tiles so if\nexample we're using Vector tiles so if we look at the page itself it's just a\nwe look at the page itself it's just a\nwe look at the page itself it's just a canvas it's actually rendering these\ncanvas it's actually rendering these\ncanvas it's actually rendering these vectors directly onto a canvas here and\nvectors directly onto a canvas here and\nvectors directly onto a canvas here and then as I pan in Zoom it's actually\nthen as I pan in Zoom it's actually\nthen as I pan in Zoom it's actually updating what's displayed on this canvas\nupdating what's displayed on this canvas\nupdating what's displayed on this canvas here using that Vector information now\nhere using that Vector information now\nhere using that Vector information now vectors are just one way to display maps\nvectors are just one way to display maps\nvectors are just one way to display maps another way to get this data about the\nanother way to get this data about the\nanother way to get this data about the map is via tiles or images and so one of\nmap is via tiles or images and so one of\nmap is via tiles or images and so one of the services you might have used or\nthe services you might have used or\nthe services you might have used or heard of is called open street map and\nheard of is called open street map and\nheard of is called open street map and they actually have a tile server that\nthey actually have a tile server that\nthey actually have a tile server that provides raster tiles or essentially\nprovides raster tiles or essentially\nprovides raster tiles or essentially images and so you'll notice as I zoom in\nimages and so you'll notice as I zoom in\nimages and so you'll notice as I zoom in or pan around the map it's not making\nor pan around the map it's not making\nor pan around the map it's not making requests for these Vector files it's\nrequests for these Vector files it's\nrequests for these Vector files it's literally making requests for PNG images\nliterally making requests for PNG images\nliterally making requests for PNG images and then the JavaScript library is just\nand then the JavaScript library is just\nand then the JavaScript library is just adding these images to the page and so\nadding these images to the page and so\nadding these images to the page and so as I pan in Zoom you can see the actual\nas I pan in Zoom you can see the actual\nas I pan in Zoom you can see the actual loading is like squares that get popped\nloading is like squares that get popped\nloading is like squares that get popped in as I as I pan around because it's\nin as I as I pan around because it's\nin as I as I pan around because it's actually putting those images into the\nactually putting those images into the\nactually putting those images into the correct Place based on where I'm panning\ncorrect Place based on where I'm panning\ncorrect Place based on where I'm panning and zooming now the example on\nand zooming now the example on\nand zooming now the example on openstreetmap.org is using this Library\nopenstreetmap.org is using this Library\nopenstreetmap.org is using this Library called leaflet and you can see that it's\ncalled leaflet and you can see that it's\ncalled leaflet and you can see that it's actually just adding those images to the\nactually just adding those images to the\nactually just adding those images to the page here so it's not rendering to the\npage here so it's not rendering to the\npage here so it's not rendering to the canvas literally as I pan and zoom\ncanvas literally as I pan and zoom\ncanvas literally as I pan and zoom around all of these images are in the\naround all of these images are in the\naround all of these images are in the Dom and then the library is just\nDom and then the library is just\nDom and then the library is just changing which images I can see as I pan\nchanging which images I can see as I pan\nchanging which images I can see as I pan and zoom around now from here that\nand zoom around now from here that\nand zoom around now from here that process just gets repeated right so as a\nprocess just gets repeated right so as a\nprocess just gets repeated right so as a user pans and zooms around the\nuser pans and zooms around the\nuser pans and zooms around the JavaScript library is going to figure\nJavaScript library is going to figure\nJavaScript library is going to figure out which parts of the map they need\nout which parts of the map they need\nout which parts of the map they need make the request out to that tile server\nmake the request out to that tile server\nmake the request out to that tile server get the tiles or the vectors back and\nget the tiles or the vectors back and\nget the tiles or

generous free tier so if you look here at the\nfree tier so if you look here at the\nfree tier so if you look here at the vector tiles API you get 200,000\nvector tiles API you get 200,000\nvector tiles API you get 200,000 requests every month for free and so\nrequests every month for free and so\nrequests every month for free and so again this is probably enough for most\nagain this is

application like the example I\ndemand application like the example I\ndemand application like the example I showed at the beginning of the video you\nshowed at the beginning of the video you\nshowed at the beginning of the video you might actually have a pretty big bill\nmight actually have a pretty big bill\nmight actually have a pretty big bill every month and so the question becomes\nevery month and so the question becomes\nevery month and so the question becomes how can we do this for free well first\nhow can we do this for free well first\nhow can we do this for free well first it comes down to the JavaScript library\nit comes down to the JavaScript library\nit comes down to the JavaScript library and I already showed you map Libre so\nand I already showed you map Libre so\nand

things about\ntier but one of the cool things about\ntier but one of the cool things about them is they offer up all of these\nthem is they offer up all of these\nthem is they offer up all of these different kinds of styles of map and you\ndifferent kinds of styles of map and you\ndifferent kinds of styles of map and you can typically use these map Tyler Styles\ncan typically use these map Tyler

actually add these styles to your mapbox map or your\nthese styles to your mapbox map or your\nthese styles to your mapbox map or your map Libre map and so beyond that there\nmap Libre map and so beyond that there\nmap Libre map and so beyond that there is also the map Libre style\nis also the map Libre style\nis also the map Libre style specification which is essentially a way\nspecification which is essentially a way\nspecification which is essentially a way of describing how a map should look\nof describing how a map should look\nof describing how a map should look given some vectors and so with this\ngiven some vectors and so with this\ngiven some vectors and so with this style specification you can take all the\nstyle specification you can take all the\nstyle specification you can take all the parts of the vector map like the terrain\nparts of the vector map like the terrain\nparts of the vector map like the terrain and buildings and Roads and words and\nand buildings and Roads and words and\nand buildings and Roads and words and you can actually specify how they should\nyou can actually specify how they should\nyou can actually specify how they should be styled and this is also one of the\nbe styled and this is also one of the\nbe styled and this is also one of the things that open free map offers so if\nthings that open free map offers so if\nthings that open

and if you look in their quick\nalso 3D and if you look in their quick\nalso 3D and if you look in their quick start guide they give you the URL to\nstart guide they give you the URL to\nstart guide they give you the URL to these specific style so if you want to\nthese specific style so if you want to\nthese specific style so if you want to add the Liberty style to your map you\nadd the Liberty

then start changing all of the\nthen start changing all of the\nthen start changing all of the properties to create a custom style and\nproperties to create a custom style and\nproperties to create a

pops\nyou'll see after the page loads it pops that map to show approximately where I\nthat map to show approximately where I\nthat map to show approximately where I am let's see how close I mean I'm in\nam let's see how close I mean I'm in\nam let's see how close I mean I'm in Denver I'll say that so it says yes I'm\nDenver I'll say that so it says yes I'm\nDenver I'll say that so it says yes I'm approximately there and so it's just\napproximately there and so it's just\napproximately there and so it's just this basic example but one of the main\nthis basic example but one of the main\nthis basic example but one of the main things I want to show is the fact that\nthings I want to show is the fact that\nthings I want to show is the fact that you can add your own Styles and so right\nyou can add your own Styles and so right\nyou can add your own Styles and so right here inside of this Styles directory I\nhere inside of this Styles directory I\nhere inside of this Styles directory I have dark. Json and inside of here I'm\nhave dark. Json and inside of here I'm\nhave dark. Json and inside of here I'm pointing to the open free map tiles but\npointing to the open free map tiles but\npointing to the open free map tiles but then I've gone in and updated all the\nthen I've gone in and updated all the\nthen I've gone in and updated all the layers to have this dark style and so if\nlayers to have this dark style and so if\nlayers to have this dark style and so if we pull that style file in instead of\nwe pull that style file in instead of\nwe pull that style file in instead of Liberty we can see the map updates and\nLiberty we can see the map updates and\nLiberty we can see the map updates and now we have some dark Styles you could\nnow we have some dark Styles you could\nnow we have some dark Styles you could even combine this with like a dark mode\neven combine this with like a dark mode\neven combine this with like a dark mode and light mode toggle right right so\nand light mode toggle right right so\nand light mode toggle right right so when you're in dark mode load the dark\nwhen you're in dark mode load the dark\nwhen you're in dark mode load the dark map Styles otherwise load the light map\nmap Styles otherwise load the light map\nmap Styles otherwise load the light map Styles uh but yeah I just wanted to show\nStyles uh but yeah I just wanted to show\nStyles uh but yeah I just wanted to show that as long as that Json file is\nthat as long as that Json file is\nthat as long as that Json file is accessible to the JavaScript code here\naccessible to the JavaScript code here\naccessible to the JavaScript code here it can load in those custom Styles now\nit can load in those custom Styles now\nit can load in those custom Styles now the next example I want to show you is\nthe next example I want to show you is\nthe next example I want to show you is leaflet and so if you're already using\nleaflet and so if you're already using\nleaflet and so if you're already using leaflet maybe you don't want to jump to\nleaflet maybe you don't want to jump to\nleaflet maybe you don't want to jump to something like map lebre this example\nsomething like map lebre this example\nsomething like map lebre this example will show you how you can still use that\nwill show you how you can still use that\nwill show you how you can still use that tile layer inside of a leaflet app and\ntile layer inside of a leaflet app and\ntile layer inside of a leaflet app and so this example is set up in the exact\nso this example is set up in the exact\nso this example is set up in the exact same way except we do need two CSS file\nsame way except we do need two CSS file\nsame way except we do need two CSS file so we have to bring in the leaflet CSS\nso we have to bring in the leaflet CSS\nso we have to bring in the leaflet CSS and then we also bring in the map Libre\nand then we also bring in the map Libre\nand then we also bring in the map Libre CSS and so essentially the map libbre\nCSS and so essentially the map libbre\nCSS and so essentially the map libbre Library provides a layer that can be\nLibrary provides a layer that can be\nLibrary provides a layer that can be added to a leaflet map that will then\nadded to a leaflet map that will then\nadded to a leaflet map that will then render out the vector tiles and so I\nrender out the vector tiles and so I\nrender out the vector tiles and so I first load in leaflet I then load in the\nfirst load in leaflet I then load in the\nfirst load in leaflet I then load in the map lib Base Library and then I add in\nmap lib Base Library and then I add in\nmap lib Base Library and then I add in the compatibility layer the leaflet map\nthe compatibility layer the leaflet map\nthe compatibility layer the leaflet map lib GL and essentially what this Library\nlib GL and essentially what this Library\nlib GL and essentially what this Library does is it adds a map Libre GL method to\ndoes is it adds a map Libre GL method to\ndoes is it adds a map Libre GL method to your Global leaflet instance and then\nyour Global leaflet instance and then\nyour Global leaflet instance and then you can specifically add the layer there\nyou can specifically add the layer there\nyou can specifically add the layer there so you can see that I Enit a leaflet map\nso you can see that I Enit a leaflet map\nso you can see that I Enit a leaflet map with no tile layer then after that I add\nwith no tile layer then after that I add\nwith no tile layer then after that I add the map Libre GL layer which allows us\nthe map Libre GL layer which allows us\nthe map Libre GL layer which allows us to use the open free map tiles but\nto use the open free map tiles but\nto use the open free map tiles but you'll notice I'm also passing in\nyou'll notice I'm also passing in\nyou'll notice I'm also passing in attribution and so this just adds a link\nattribution and so this just adds a link\nattribution and so this just adds a link out to open free map but because open\nout to open free map but because open\nout to open free map but because open free map is based on top of open street\nfree map is based on top of open street\nfree map is based on top of open street map data you do need a link out to open\nmap data you do need a link out to open\nmap data you do need a link out to open street map at a minimum and if you look\nstreet map at a minimum and if you look\nstreet map at a minimum and if you look at the open free map website they do\nat the open free map website they do\nat the open free map website they do show you the attribution that you need\nshow you the attribution that you need\nshow you the attribution that you need here and they mention you don't have to\nhere and they mention you don't have to\nhere and they mention you don't have to even mention open free map but it is\neven mention open free map but it is\neven mention open free map but it is nice to and I would because they're\nnice to and I would because they're\nnice to and I would because they're giving you free tiles come on and so if\ngiving you free tiles come on and so if\ngiving you free tiles come on and so if you want to run this example it's\nyou want to run this example it's\nyou want to run this example it's similar to the other vanilla example so\nsimilar to the other vanilla example so\nsimilar to the other vanilla example so I'll just use live server to open this\nI'll just use live server to open this\nI'll just use live server to open this up and we can see that it loads up and\nup and we can see that it loads up and\nup and we can see that it loads up and so now I have a a leaf FP map but it's\nso now I have a a leaf FP map but it's\nso now I have a a leaf FP map but it's using the open map tile server via that\nusing the open map tile server via that\nusing the open map tile server via that map Libre compatibility layer and you\nmap Libre compatibility layer and you\nmap Libre compatibility layer and you can see I have my attribution down here\ncan see I have my attribution down here\ncan see I have my attribution down here so people can click out to see where all\nso people can click out to see where all\nso people can click out to see where all this data and tiles are coming from now\nthis data and tiles are coming from now\nthis data and tiles are coming from now these next three examples use a\nthese next three examples use a\nthese next three examples use a front-end framework like react spelt or\nfront-end framework like react spelt or\nfront-end framework like react spelt or View and to do that typically you want\nView and to do that typically you want\nView and to do that typically you want to use a wrapper library and so whenever\nto use a wrapper library and so whenever\nto use a wrapper library and so whenever you're using a map library in your\nyou're using a map library in your\nyou're using a map library in your webpage typically that map library is\nwebpage typically that map library is\nwebpage typically that map library is interacting directly with the Dom or the\ninteracting directly with the Dom or the\ninteracting directly with the Dom or the canvas API right it's creating elements\ncanvas API right it's creating elements\ncanvas API right it's creating elements it's modifying the canvas and so if you\nit's modifying the canvas and so if you\nit's modifying the canvas and so if you want to use this library in conjunction\nwant to use this library in conjunction\nwant to use this library in conjunction with the front end framework there are\nwith the front end framework there are\nwith the front end framework there are some things you need to think about\nsome things you need to think about\nsome things you need to think about because when you're using a frontend\nbecause when you're using a frontend\nbecause when you're using a frontend framework that front end framework has\nframework that front end framework has\nframework that front end framework has some runtime and in the case of view and\nsome runtime and in the case of view and\nsome runtime and in the case of view and react there's also a virtual Dom runtime\nreact there's also a virtual Dom runtime\nreact there's also a virtual Dom runtime and so typically they don't want you to\nand so typically they don't want you to\nand so typically they don't want you to directly modify the Dom and if you're\ndirectly modify the Dom and if you're\ndirectly modify the Dom and if you're going to you then need to use some sort\ngoing to you then need to use some sort\ngoing to you then need to use some sort of ref so that way it can stay in sync\nof ref so that way it can stay in sync\nof ref so that way it can stay in sync with your components and the virtual Dom\nwith your components and the virtual Dom\nwith your components and the virtual Dom model and so your application code is\nmodel and so your application code is\nmodel and so your application code is typically talking directly to that front\ntypically talking directly to that front\ntypically talking directly to that front end framework like view or react or\nend framework like view or react or\nend framework like view or react or spelt and then in turn it's modifying\nspelt and then in turn it's modifying\nspelt and then in turn it's modifying the Dom and creating elements and so if\nthe Dom and creating elements and so if\nthe Dom and creating elements and so if we want to use this front end framework\nwe want to use this front end framework\nwe want to use this front end framework in combination with something like appap\nin combination with something like appap\nin combination with something like appap Libre we need some sort of compatibility\nLibre we need some sort of compatibility\nLibre we need some sort of compatibility layer we need something that's going to\nlayer we need something that's going to\nlayer we need something that's going to be able to create refs and do the\nbe able to create refs and do the\nbe able to create refs and do the various things that you need to do to\nvarious things that you need to do to\nvarious things that you need to do to make sure that this frontend framework\nmake sure that this frontend framework\nmake sure that this frontend framework works in the right way and that looks a\nworks in the right way and that looks a\nworks in the right way and that looks a little bit like this so these libraries\nlittle bit like this so these libraries\nlittle bit like this so these libraries typically provide declarative component\ntypically provide declarative component\ntypically provide declarative component wrappers and so you're going to get like\nwrappers and so you're going to get like\nwrappers and so you're going to get like a capital M map component that you can\na capital M map component that you can\na capital M map component that you can just add into your page which in turn is\njust add into your page which in turn is\njust add into your page which in turn is going to create a map under the hood\ngoing to create a map under the hood\ngoing to create a map under the hood using the map Libre Library uh but it's\nusing the map Libre Library uh but it's\nusing the map Libre Library uh but it's going to use refs in all the right ways\ngoing to use refs in all the right ways\ngoing to use refs in all the right ways so you can actually integrate it into\nso you can actually integrate it into\nso you can actually integrate it into your react application so the\nyour react application so the\nyour react application so the application code that you're writing\napplication code that you're writing\napplication code that you're writing still just pulls in these declarative\nstill just pulls in these declarative\nstill just pulls in these declarative components like map and popup and marker\ncomponents like map and popup and marker\ncomponents like map and popup and marker but under the hood they are talking to\nbut under the hood they are talking to\nbut under the hood they are talking to the underlying library in this case map\nthe underlying library in this case map\nthe underlying library in this case map Libre and then also using refs and\nLibre and then also using refs and\nLibre and then also using refs and everything else that's required to make\neverything else that's required to make\neverything else that's required to make sure that it stays in sync with the\nsure that it stays in sync with the\nsure that it stays in sync with the framework itself and so now let's take a\nframework itself and so now let's take a\nframework itself and so now let's take a look at the react example and for this\nlook at the react example and for this\nlook at the react example and for this example I reached for vigl react map\nexample I reached for vigl react map\nexample I reached for vigl react map libbre and so this is a component\nlibbre and so this is a component\nlibbre and so this is a component library that gives us declarative\nlibrary that gives us declarative\nlibrary that gives us declarative components that wraps all the underlying\ncomponents that wraps all the underlying\ncomponents that wraps all the underlying map Libre functionality and if you look\nmap Libre functionality and if you look\nmap Libre functionality and if you look in the map Libre docs there actually are\nin the map Libre docs there actually are\nin the map Libre docs there actually are a few different libraries you can use\na few different libraries you can use\na few different libraries you can use but one of the the reasons I chose this\nbut one of the the reasons I chose this\nbut one of the the reasons I chose this one is because I'm very familiar with\none is because I'm very familiar with\none is because I'm very familiar with their react map GL library and so this\ntheir react map GL library and so this\ntheir react map GL library and so this is what a lot of people use if you're\nis what a lot of people use if you're\nis what a lot of people use if you're trying to combine react with mapbox and\ntrying to combine react with mapbox and\ntrying to combine react with mapbox and the react map Libre library is from the\nthe react map Libre library is from the\nthe react map Libre library is from the same creators but it's specifically for\nsame creators but it's specifically for\nsame creators but it's specifically for map Libre instead of mapbox and so\nmap Libre instead of mapbox and so\nmap Libre instead of mapbox and so that's why I chose this library but you\nthat's why I chose this library but you\nthat's why I chose this library but you can see after you install map libg and\ncan see after you install map libg and\ncan see after you install map libg and then also this Library you then get\nthen also this Library you then get\nthen also this Library you then get declarative components right they give\ndeclarative components right they give\ndeclarative components right they give you a map component that you can just\nyou a map component that you can just\nyou a map component that you can just add to your page and you can actually\nadd to your page and you can actually\nadd to your page and you can actually bind the styles to a state variable and\nbind the styles to a state variable and\nbind the styles to a state variable and then use reacts state system to change\nthen use reacts state system to change\nthen use reacts state system to change the center of the map or the zoom or\nthe center of the map or the zoom or\nthe center of the map or the zoom or other things like that and so if you\nother things like that and so if you\nother things like that and so if you take a look at our example I'm pulling\ntake a look at our example I'm pulling\ntake a look at our example I'm pulling the map in I have an initial view state\nthe map in I have an initial view state\nthe map in I have an initial view state so I just have this middle of the USA\nso I just have this middle of the USA\nso I just have this middle of the USA constant and so if for whatever reason I\nconstant and so if for whatever reason I\nconstant and so if for whatever reason I can't get the user's location it's going\ncan't get the user's location it's going\ncan't get the user's location it's going to show the map kind of zoomed out where\nto show the map kind of zoomed out where\nto show the map kind of zoomed out where the the US is is in the middle there and\nthe the US is is in the middle there and\nthe the US is is in the middle there and from there you can see I'm passing in\nfrom there you can see I'm passing in\nfrom there you can see I'm passing in the map Styles just like in the vanilla\nthe map Styles just like in the vanilla\nthe map Styles just like in the vanilla example in the public directory is where\nexample in the public directory is where\nexample in the public directory is where those Styles live and so again you can\nthose Styles live and so again you can\nthose Styles live and so again you can customize these Styles just host them\ncustomize these Styles just host them\ncustomize these Styles just host them right there where your code is hosted\nright there where your code is hosted\nright there where your code is hosted and you'll be able to get some custom\nand you'll be able to get some custom\nand you'll be able to get some custom styles for your map now from there I\nstyles for your map now from there I\nstyles for your map now from there I have this custom component called you\nhave this custom component called you\nhave this custom component called you are here and this works in the same way\nare here and this works in the same way\nare here and this works in the same way as the vanilla example where it calls\nas the vanilla example where it calls\nas the vanilla example where it calls that API to get your approximate\nthat API to get your approximate\nthat API to get your approximate location and then we'll zoom in and add\nlocation and then we'll zoom in and add\nlocation and then we'll zoom in and add a popup at that location but you can see\na popup at that location but you can see\na popup at that location but you can see I'm using it in a declarative way and so\nI'm using it in a declarative way and so\nI'm using it in a declarative way and so if I go to this specific component first\nif I go to this specific component first\nif I go to this specific component first of all you can see that their Library\nof all you can see that their Library\nof all you can see that their Library provides a hook called use map and so\nprovides a hook called use map and so\nprovides a hook called use map and so essentially this is a context and\nessentially this is a context and\nessentially this is a context and because this component lives inside of\nbecause this component lives inside of\nbecause this component lives inside of the map component it can get access to\nthe map component it can get access to\nthe map component it can get access to the current map via the context and once\nthe current map via the context and once\nthe current map via the context and once I have access to the map I can do a lot\nI have access to the map I can do a lot\nI have access to the map I can do a lot of things like calling one of its\nof things like calling one of its\nof things like calling one of its built-in methods like fly two and then\nbuilt-in methods like fly two and then\nbuilt-in methods like fly two and then from there you can see that I have an\nfrom there you can see that I have an\nfrom there you can see that I have an internal State variable that's going to\ninternal State variable that's going to\ninternal State variable that's going to be the actual location of the popup so\nbe the actual location of the popup so\nbe the actual location of the popup so it defaults to the middle of the USA in\nit defaults to the middle of the USA in\nit defaults to the middle of the USA in the event that I couldn't get the user's\nthe event that I couldn't get the user's\nthe event that I couldn't get the user's location and then after I did get their\nlocation and then after I did get their\nlocation and then after I did get their location I update that state and then we\nlocation I update that state and then we\nlocation I update that state and then we rerender it and so you can see here I'm\nrerender it and so you can see here I'm\nrerender it and so you can see here I'm using this declarative component called\nusing this declarative component called\nusing this declarative component called popup it comes from react map Libre and\npopup it comes from react map Libre and\npopup it comes from react map Libre and then they have a bunch of props that you\nthen they have a bunch of props that you\nthen they have a bunch of props that you can pass in so I'm just passing in the\ncan pass in so I'm just passing in the\ncan pass in so I'm just passing in the latitude and longitude and then the text\nlatitude and longitude and then the text\nlatitude and longitude and then the text that should be displayed but this is\nthat should be displayed but this is\nthat should be displayed but this is typically how you'll Implement things\ntypically how you'll Implement things\ntypically how you'll Implement things when you're working inside of react is\nwhen you're working inside of react is\nwhen you're working inside of react is you'll mainly be looking at the docs for\nyou'll mainly be looking at the docs for\nyou'll mainly be looking at the docs for react map Libre and and using all of the\nreact map Libre and and using all of the\nreact map Libre and and using all of the things that they have available for you\nthings that they have available for you\nthings that they have available for you like these Hooks and these declarative\nlike these Hooks and these declarative\nlike these Hooks and these declarative components now let's take a look at the\ncomponents now let's take a look at the\ncomponents now let's take a look at the view example and for the view example I\nview example and for the view example I\nview example and for the view example I am using this indoor equal view map\nam using this indoor equal view map\nam using this indoor equal view map Libre GL so this is the only one that's\nLibre GL so this is the only one that's\nLibre GL so this is the only one that's Linked In the map Libra documentation I\nLinked In the map Libra documentation I\nLinked In the map Libra documentation I found one other but because this one is\nfound one other but because this one is\nfound one other but because this one is linked here and if you're in the N\nlinked here and if you're in the N\nlinked here and if you're in the N ecosystem there's actually a n map lib\necosystem there's actually a n map lib\necosystem there's actually a n map lib Library it actually wraps this Library\nLibrary it actually wraps this Library\nLibrary it actually wraps this Library so that's why I chose to implement with\nso that's why I chose to implement with\nso that's why I chose to implement with this specific library but it's very\nthis specific library but it's very\nthis specific library but it's very similar to react map libate and that\nsimilar to react map libate and that\nsimilar to react map libate and that they provide these declarative\nthey provide these declarative\nthey provide these declarative components so you'll see that if I want\ncomponents so you'll see that if I want\ncomponents so you'll see that if I want a map we get access to this mg- map\na map we get access to this mg- map\na map we get access to this mg- map component that I can just add directly\ncomponent that I can just add directly\ncomponent that I can just add directly inside of my view components and so in\ninside of my view components and so in\ninside of my view components and so in my view example here I'm pulling in that\nmy view example here I'm pulling in that\nmy view example here I'm pulling in that mgl map rendering it defaulting to the\nmgl map rendering it defaulting to the\nmgl map rendering it defaulting to the middle of the USA in the event that I I\nmiddle of the USA in the event that I I\nmiddle of the USA in the event that I I can't find the user's location in this\ncan't find the user's location in this\ncan't find the user's location in this case I'm also using some types directly\ncase I'm also using some types directly\ncase I'm also using some types directly from map Libra AGL and so I was running\nfrom map Libra AGL and so I was running\nfrom map Libra AGL and so I was running into an issue where because by default\ninto an issue where because by default\ninto an issue where because by default the inferred type is an array of numbers\nthe inferred type is an array of numbers\nthe inferred type is an array of numbers I couldn't pass it directly into the\nI couldn't pass it directly into the\nI couldn't pass it directly into the center location prop right here and so\ncenter location prop right here and so\ncenter location prop right here and so if I just use a type assertion then I'm\nif I just use a type assertion then I'm\nif I just use a type assertion then I'm able to actually pass that prop down\nable to actually pass that prop down\nable to actually pass that prop down here you can see we pass in the map\nhere you can see we pass in the map\nhere you can see we pass in the map style in a very similar way and then I\nstyle in a very similar way and then I\nstyle in a very similar way and then I have my custom component Ur are here and\nhave my custom component Ur are here and\nhave my custom component Ur are here and so that lives as a child of mgl map and\nso that lives as a child of mgl map and\nso that lives as a child of mgl map and that gives us access to the underlying\nthat gives us access to the underlying\nthat gives us access to the underlying map Libre map that that gets created\nmap Libre map that that gets created\nmap Libre map that that gets created inside of this component and we can\ninside of this component and we can\ninside of this component and we can access that inside of here so if we\naccess that inside of here so if we\naccess that inside of here so if we check out you are here the view map\ncheck out you are here the view map\ncheck out you are here the view map Libre GL Library exposes a hook called\nLibre GL Library exposes a hook called\nLibre GL Library exposes a hook called use map and so this gives us access to\nuse map and so this gives us access to\nuse map and so this gives us access to the map in the current context and so\nthe map in the current context and so\nthe map in the current context and so because our component is a child of that\nbecause our component is a child of that\nbecause our component is a child of that mgl map component we're going to get\nmgl map component we're going to get\nmgl map component we're going to get access to that map ref and then from\naccess to that map ref and then from\naccess to that map ref and then from there I just have a watch effect and so\nthere I just have a watch effect and so\nthere I just have a watch effect and so I'm basically looking for is the map\nI'm basically looking for is the map\nI'm basically looking for is the map loaded do we have access to that\nloaded do we have access to that\nloaded do we have access to that underlying ref and if we don't I'm just\nunderlying ref and if we don't I'm just\nunderlying ref and if we don't I'm just returning but the moment that we do I'm\nreturning but the moment that we do I'm\nreturning but the moment that we do I'm going to grab the user's location and if\ngoing to grab the user's location and if\ngoing to grab the user's location and if it's not the middle of the USA meaning I\nit's not the middle of the USA meaning I\nit's not the middle of the USA meaning I was able to get their location we are\nwas able to get their location we are\nwas able to get their location we are going to update our state value here to\ngoing to update our state value here to\ngoing to update our state value here to be that location and then also call the\nbe that location and then also call the\nbe that location and then also call the fly to method on the underlying map libr\nfly to method on the underlying map libr\nfly to method on the underlying map libr map instance uh and then from there I'm\nmap instance uh and then from there I'm\nmap instance uh and then from there I'm using their declarative component called\nusing their declarative component called\nusing their declarative component called mgl popup and in this case I don't want\nmgl popup and in this case I don't want\nmgl popup and in this case I don't want this to display unless the map is\nthis to display unless the map is\nthis to display unless the map is actually loaded and I do need to pass in\nactually loaded and I do need to pass in\nactually loaded and I do need to pass in the coordinates now this is one of the\nthe coordinates now this is one of the\nthe coordinates now this is one of the things about these wrapper libraries\nthings about these wrapper libraries\nthings about these wrapper libraries that you might come come across is they\nthat you might come come across is they\nthat you might come come across is they decide what props to expose for any\ndecide what props to expose for any\ndecide what props to expose for any given component and they also get to\ngiven component and they also get to\ngiven component and they also get to decide what are the default props\ndecide what are the default props\ndecide what are the default props because under the hood this needs to\nbecause under the hood this needs to\nbecause under the hood this needs to create a popup using map Libre but\ncreate a popup using map Libre but\ncreate a popup using map Libre but they're giving us this declarative way\nthey're giving us this declarative way\nthey're giving us this declarative way of doing it and so the default Behavior\nof doing it and so the default Behavior\nof doing it and so the default Behavior here is that it will not close on click\nhere is that it will not close on click\nhere is that it will not close on click and so I do have to pass in false and\nand so I do have to pass in false and\nand so I do have to pass in false and then I can also pass in the coordinates\nthen I can also pass in the coordinates\nthen I can also pass in the coordinates which will display that popup on the\nwhich will display that popup on the\nwhich will display that popup on the page now again just like the react\npage now again just like the react\npage now again just like the react example I have a public folder where I'm\nexample I have a public folder where I'm\nexample I have a public folder where I'm storing those Styles so if you want to\nstoring those Styles so if you want to\nstoring those Styles so if you want to load in the custom Styles you can just\nload in the custom Styles you can just\nload in the custom Styles you can just do it directly from the same code base\ndo it directly from the same code base\ndo it directly from the same code base now let's take a look at the spelt\nnow let's take a look at the spelt\nnow let's take a look at the spelt example so for this example example I\nexample so for this example example I\nexample so for this example example I decided to use the rapper Library called\ndecided to use the rapper Library called\ndecided to use the rapper Library called spelt map Libre and if you look in the\nspelt map Libre and if you look in the\nspelt map Libre and if you look in the map libbre docs there are a couple\nmap libbre docs there are a couple\nmap libbre docs there are a couple different libraries linked but this one\ndifferent libraries linked but this one\ndifferent libraries linked but this one I found to have most of the components\nI found to have most of the components\nI found to have most of the components that you would need and I did come\nthat you would need and I did come\nthat you would need and I did come across one issue with the pop-up\nacross one issue with the pop-up\nacross one issue with the pop-up component I'll show you how I fix but\ncomponent I'll show you how I fix but\ncomponent I'll show you how I fix but for the most part this seems to have\nfor the most part this seems to have\nfor the most part this seems to have everything that you need and so we can\neverything that you need and so we can\neverything that you need and so we can take a look here at my entry point I'm\ntake a look here at my entry point I'm\ntake a look here at my entry point I'm pulling in map Libre from their library\npulling in map Libre from their library\npulling in map Libre from their library and so this is a component that's going\nand so this is a component that's going\nand so this is a component that's going to render a map right there pass in the\nto render a map right there pass in the\nto render a map right there pass in the middle of the USA location by default\nmiddle of the USA location by default\nmiddle of the USA location by default and then pass in the style URL as well\nand then pass in the style URL as well\nand then pass in the style URL as well and because this is a v app just like\nand because this is a v app just like\nand because this is a v app just like the react app and the view app we can\nthe react app and the view app we can\nthe react app and the view app we can put those Styles inside of the public\nput those Styles inside of the public\nput those Styles inside of the public folder and then I have my own custom\nfolder and then I have my own custom\nfolder and then I have my own custom component called you are here so let's\ncomponent called you are here so let's\ncomponent called you are here so let's take a look at that now spelt map Libre\ntake a look at that now spelt map Libre\ntake a look at that now spelt map Libre provides this function called map\nprovides this function called map\nprovides this function called map context and essentially this is a spelt\ncontext and essentially this is a spelt\ncontext and essentially this is a spelt store that will give you access to the\nstore that will give you access to the\nstore that will give you access to the current map that you are rendering\ncurrent map that you are rendering\ncurrent map that you are rendering inside of and so this is what will allow\ninside of and so this is what will allow\ninside of and so this is what will allow us to actually fly to the user's\nus to actually fly to the user's\nus to actually fly to the user's location once we have it now you'll\nlocation once we have it now you'll\nlocation once we have it now you'll notice here that I'm not using the\nnotice here that I'm not using the\nnotice here that I'm not using the declarative pop-up component here I just\ndeclarative pop-up component here I just\ndeclarative pop-up component here I just had some issues getting it to actually\nhad some issues getting it to actually\nhad some issues getting it to actually render the text it was showing up as\nrender the text it was showing up as\nrender the text it was showing up as blank and so if you take a look at their\nblank and so if you take a look at their\nblank and so if you take a look at their examples they do do have some examples\nexamples they do do have some examples\nexamples they do do have some examples that have popups like this is an example\nthat have popups like this is an example\nthat have popups like this is an example of a pop-up here you can see pretty much\nof a pop-up here you can see pretty much\nof a pop-up here you can see pretty much anytime they have a popup it's rendered\nanytime they have a popup it's rendered\nanytime they have a popup it's rendered inside of a marker and so I don't know\ninside of a marker and so I don't know\ninside of a marker and so I don't know if internally they're kind of just\nif internally they're kind of just\nif internally they're kind of just assuming that anytime you have a popup\nassuming that anytime you have a popup\nassuming that anytime you have a popup it needs to be a child of a marker which\nit needs to be a child of a marker which\nit needs to be a child of a marker which will probably be the case in most\nwill probably be the case in most\nwill probably be the case in most scenarios but for my example I didn't\nscenarios but for my example I didn't\nscenarios but for my example I didn't even want a marker I just wanted a popup\neven want a marker I just wanted a popup\neven want a marker I just wanted a popup and so I couldn't get it to render but\nand so I couldn't get it to render but\nand so I couldn't get it to render but the nice thing is because all of these\nthe nice thing is because all of these\nthe nice thing is because all of these libraries are going to give you access\nlibraries are going to give you access\nlibraries are going to give you access to that underlying map Libre instance\nto that underlying map Libre instance\nto that underlying map Libre instance you can still do all the same map libbre\nyou can still do all the same map libbre\nyou can still do all the same map libbre things if for whatever reason they're\nthings if for whatever reason they're\nthings if for whatever reason they're components aren't working or maybe they\ncomponents aren't working or maybe they\ncomponents aren't working or maybe they don't provide a component that does what\ndon't provide a component that does what\ndon't provide a component that does what you need it to do so you can see here\nyou need it to do so you can see here\nyou need it to do so you can see here that I'm pulling popup directly from the\nthat I'm pulling popup directly from the\nthat I'm pulling popup directly from the map Libre library and then I'm just\nmap Libre library and then I'm just\nmap Libre library and then I'm just creating an instance to it and they have\ncreating an instance to it and they have\ncreating an instance to it and they have a method that allows you to add it to\na method that allows you to add it to\na method that allows you to add it to the map and so this is kind of combining\nthe map and so this is kind of combining\nthe map and so this is kind of combining using the spelt map Libre library with\nusing the spelt map Libre library with\nusing the spelt map Libre library with just direct vanilla map Libre code to\njust direct vanilla map Libre code to\njust direct vanilla map Libre code to kind of add things dynamically and the\nkind of add things dynamically and the\nkind of add things dynamically and the last thing I want to point you to is\nlast thing I want to point you to is\nlast thing I want to point you to is awesome map Libre so this is a GitHub\nawesome map Libre so this is a GitHub\nawesome map Libre so this is a GitHub repo that has a bunch of various\nrepo that has a bunch of various\nrepo that has a bunch of various libraries and tools and things that you\nlibraries and tools and things that you\nlibraries and tools and things that you might use in conjunction with map Libre\nmight use in conjunction with map Libre\nmight use in conjunction with map Libre and so if there's something specific\nand so if there's something specific\nand so if there's something specific you're trying to do or a specific uh\nyou're trying to do or a specific uh\nyou're trying to do or a specific uh framework or Library you're trying to\nframework or Library you're trying to\nframework or Library you're trying to integrate with you'll probably find a\nintegrate with you'll probably find a\nintegrate with you'll probably find a resource there on this page now that's\nresource there on this page now that's\nresource there on this page now that's it for this video hopefully I've given\nit for this video hopefully I've given\nit for this video hopefully I've given you enough to get up and going with open\nyou enough to get up and going with open\nyou enough to get up and going with open free map and so you can go out and build\nfree map and so you can go out and build\nfree map and so you can go out and build your own completely free map\nyour own completely free map\nyour own completely free map applications uh definitely drop a star\napplications uh definitely drop a star\napplications uh definitely drop a star over on the open free map GitHub repo uh\nover on the open free map GitHub repo uh\nover on the open free map GitHub repo uh hypernut is providing the service\nhypernut is providing the service\nhypernut is providing the

so\nawesome so you can also sponsor them so if you are using open free map in your\nif you are using open free map in your\nif you are using open free map in your applications and you're getting some\napplications and you're getting some\napplications and you're getting some good use out of it definitely go sponsor\ngood use out of it definitely go sponsor\ngood use out of it definitely go sponsor hypernut on GitHub as well all right\nhypernut on GitHub as well all right\nhypernut on GitHub as well all right that's all I got for this one I'll see\nthat's all I got for this one I'll

basically I\nstyling and then uh we can basically I think map Style Style okay so we need\nthink map Style Style okay so we need\nthink map Style Style okay so we need the map style we need the\nthe map style we need the\nthe map style we need the layers yeah map Libra so we can just the\nlayers yeah map Libra so we can just the\nlayers yeah map Libra so we can just the map style um basically\neverything paste that in here actually\neverything paste that in here actually here we're done using any\nhere we're done using any\nhere we're done using any typescript so and then yeah we need the\ntypescript so and then yeah we need the\ntypescript so and then yeah we need the bucket so again we can just you know\nbucket so again we can just you know\nbucket so again we can just you know upload our PM ties static PM ties file\nupload our PM ties static PM ties file\nupload our PM ties static PM ties file we can get the URL and we we can put\nwe can get the URL and we we can

now\ntimestamp there we are and I believe now\ntimestamp there we are and I believe now if we start this back up so the thing is\nif we start this back up so the thing is\nif we start this back up so the thing is currently it doesn't work in Expo go\ncurrently it doesn't work in Expo go\ncurrently it doesn't work in Expo go because it's a canary release so we just\nbecause it's a canary release so we just\nbecause it's a canary release so we just use npx Expo run iOS to kind of built\nuse npx Expo run iOS to kind of built\nuse npx Expo run iOS to kind of built the apps you know client iOS client and\nthe apps you know client iOS client and\nthe apps you know client iOS client and then we just need to have a bit of\npatients ah yeah now because I imported\npatients ah yeah now because I imported a\na\na new dependency here or just need to\nnew dependency here or just need to\nnew dependency here or just need to rebuild the\napp and there we are we're installing\napp and there we are we're installing open it on the\nopen it on the\nopen it on the iPhone and boom there we are we have our\niPhone and boom there we are we have our\niPhone and boom there we are we have our map uh and so this specifically is a map\nmap uh and so this specifically is a map\nmap uh and so this specifically is a map cut out\ncut out\ncut out of sing no oh\nof sing no oh\nof sing no oh actually was it\nactually was it\nactually was it it um so that's a whole thing of Proto\nit um so that's a whole thing of Proto\nit um so that's a whole thing of Proto maps that you can cut out parts of the\nmaps that you can cut out parts of the\nmaps that you can cut out parts of the map here in this case Rotterdam and so\nmap here in this case Rotterdam and so\nmap here in this case Rotterdam and so as you zoom in you lose the detail of\nas you zoom in you lose the detail of\nas you zoom in you lose the detail of the other actually actually it not not\nthe other actually actually it not not\nthe other actually actually it not not Rotterdam right was it rre okay now now\nRotterdam right was it rre okay now now\nRotterdam right was it rre okay now now I don't remember what was in my area I\nI don't remember what was in my area I\nI don't remember what was in my area I think it was E Yeah so quickly reload\nthink it was E Yeah so quickly reload\nthink it was E Yeah so quickly reload that but then we can also open it on the\nthat but then we can also open it on the\nthat but then we can also open it on the web app there we are and yeah I\nweb app there we are and yeah I\nweb app there we are and yeah I believe uh where\nbelieve uh where\nbelieve uh where is there so we got to zoom\nis there so we got to zoom\nis there so we got to zoom into\ninto\ninto e here yes and so basically this was a\ne here yes and so basically this was a\ne here yes and so basically this was a cutout of the rre city center so we only\ncutout of the rre city center so we only\ncutout of the rre city center so we only have the detail for\nhave the detail for\nhave the detail for R yeah I need to figure out how to like\nR yeah I need to figure out how to like\nR yeah I need to figure out how to like properly\nproperly\nproperly navigate on\nnavigate on\nnavigate on the wait where\nthe wait where\nthe wait where is where are the Netherlands there there\nis where are the Netherlands there there\nis where are the Netherlands there there they are okay and so we can zoom in to\nthey are okay and so we can zoom in to\nthey are okay and so we can zoom in to here it and we can get the details of\nhere

on\ndiscuss each and everything in depth on\ndiscuss each and everything in depth on how the geolocation industry works and\nhow the geolocation industry works and\nhow the geolocation industry works and then how you can leverage react native\nthen how you can leverage react native\nthen how you can leverage react native uh as a framework to make the apps and\nuh as a framework to make the apps and\nuh as a framework to make the apps and then use super base as the back end to\nthen use super base as the back end to\nthen use super base as the back end to facilate facilitate all the

leverage its functionalities like for\nleverage its functionalities like for\nleverage its functionalities like for example if I scroll down we are what we\nexample if I scroll down we are what we\nexample if I scroll down we are what we are going to do is we are going to\nare going to do is we are going to\nare going to do is we are going to create a map so we are going to use\ncreate a map so we are going to use\ncreate a map so we are going to use react native maps to create a map and\nreact native maps to create a map and\nreact native maps to create a map and then when the when the when the location\nthen when the when the when the location\nthen when the when the when the location moves from one place to the another\nmoves from one place to the another\nmoves from one place to the another place we are going to get that location\nplace we are going to get that location\nplace we are going to get that location and then we are going to transmit that\nand then we are going to transmit that\nand then we are going to transmit that location to the to our super base back\nlocation to the to our super base back\nlocation to the to our super base back end and then in another device which\nend and then in another device which\nend and then in another device which would be an Android emulator here we are\nwould be an Android emulator here we are\nwould be an Android

things out okay so here as you can see I have\nout okay so here as you can see I have\nout okay so here as you can see I have used the tag from map view or from react\nused the tag from map view or from react\nused the tag from map view or from react native Maps Okay so to see that I'm\nnative Maps Okay so to see that I'm\nnative Maps Okay so to see that I'm going to go to react native Maps and\ngoing to go to react native Maps and\ngoing to go to react native Maps and then here the we have finished the setup\nthen here the we have finished the setup\nthen here the we have finished the setup installation instructions and all these\ninstallation instructions and all these\ninstallation instructions and all these things next one is to literally use the\nthings next one is to literally use the\nthings next one is to literally use the map inside our component okay so to\nmap inside our component okay so to\nmap inside our component okay so to render a map after you do all these\nrender a map after you do all these\nrender a map after you do all these configuration to render a map you can\nconfiguration to render a map you can\nconfiguration to render a map you can simply copy\nsimply copy\nsimply copy this and you can past it here and then a\nthis and you can past it here and then a\nthis and you can past it here and then a map will be like a map will will show\nmap will be like a map will will show\nmap will be like a map will will show okay but it will not show properly like\nokay but it will not show properly like\nokay but it will not show properly like how I have done here okay so to um to uh\nhow I have done here okay so to um to uh\nhow I have done here okay so to um to uh show it in this manner you can use the\nshow it in this manner you can use the\nshow it in this manner you can use the configurations that I have used here\nconfigurations that I have used here\nconfigurations that I have used here okay so in a view tag I have used map\nokay so in a view tag I have used map\nokay so in a view tag I have used map view and then I have used the style\nview and then I have used the style\nview and then I have used the style which is I style like I have the map I I\nwhich is I style like I have the map I I\nwhich is I style like I have the map I I make the map uh have a full width of the\nmake the map uh have a full width of the\nmake the map uh have a full width of the screen and then full width of the full\nscreen and then full width of the full\nscreen and then full width of the full height of the screen so that it no it\nheight of the screen so that it no it\nheight of the screen so that it no it looks know complete right it looks full\nlooks know complete right it looks full\nlooks know complete right it looks full right the next step is I also I can also\nright the next step is I also I can also\nright the next step is I also I can also enable dark mode with dark mode enabl\nenable dark mode with dark mode enabl\nenable dark mode with dark mode enabl can also do that okay and then uh I can\ncan also do that okay and then uh I can\ncan also do that okay and then uh I can change this to what\nchange this to what\nchange this to what dark and do that and then it will change\ndark and do that and then it will change\ndark and do that and then it will change to dark but I you know personally I\nto dark but I you know personally I\nto dark but I you know personally I don't like this now so I'm just going to\ndon't like this now so I'm just going to\ndon't like this now so I'm just going to keep it light and then I can also use\nkeep it light and then I can also use\nkeep it light and then I can also use show user location prop I can go to the\nshow user location prop I can go to the\nshow user location prop I can go to the left to have that nice you know blue\nleft to have that nice you know blue\nleft to have that nice you know blue icon there and then as like we can also\nicon there and then as like we can also\nicon there and then as like we can also allow the map like to follow the users\nallow the map like to follow the users\nallow the map like to follow the users location okay same way the zoom control\nlocation okay same way the zoom control\nlocation okay same way the zoom control enabl so for example I can Al I'm\nenabl so for example I can Al I'm\nenabl so for example I can Al I'm zooming in right I I can disable the\nzooming in right I I can disable the\nzooming in right I I can disable the zoom as well the show compass the show\nzoom as well the show compass the show\nzoom as well the show compass the show The Compass would be shown somewhere in\nThe Compass would be shown somewhere in\nThe Compass would be shown somewhere in the Google Map site and you can also\nthe Google Map site and you can also\nthe Google Map site and you can also enable and disable it the same shows\nenable and disable it the same shows\nenable and disable it the same shows user location and the last one is the\nuser location and the last one is the\nuser location and the last one is the map padding so many people miss the map\nmap padding so many people miss the map\nmap padding so many people miss the map padding and I what I have seen is this\npadding and I what I have seen is this\npadding and I what I have seen is this particular logo right it gets overla\nparticular logo right it gets overla\nparticular logo right it gets overla with the bottom uh tab okay this bottom\nwith the bottom uh tab okay this bottom\nwith the bottom uh tab okay this bottom in iOS we have this it overlaps with the\nin iOS we have this it overlaps with the\nin iOS we have this it overlaps with the safe area view so you can use map\nsafe area view so you can use map\nsafe area view so you can use map padding to adjust these things right\npadding to adjust these things right\npadding to adjust these things right then Zoom enabl equal to true now to\nthen Zoom enabl equal to true now to\nthen Zoom enabl equal to true now to enable\nenable\nenable Google Maps in iOS you can simply go\nGoogle Maps in iOS you can simply go\nGoogle Maps in iOS you can simply go there and use\nthere and use\nthere and use provider uh provider is to\nprovider uh provider is to\nprovider uh provider is to Google okay once I have done that okay\nGoogle okay once I have done that okay\nGoogle okay once I have done that okay the app crashed so what I have to do I\nthe app crashed so what I have to do I\nthe app crashed so what I have to do I have to reload the\napp and then it would you know it would\napp and then it would you know it would work you can see Google is there and\nwork you can see Google is there and\nwork you can see Google is there and then we have our Google Maps enabled\nthen we have our Google Maps enabled\nthen we have our Google Maps enabled here okay okay so we have Google Maps\nhere okay okay so we have Google Maps\nhere okay okay so we have Google Maps SDK working properly in iOS that's how\nSDK working properly in iOS that's how\nSDK working properly in iOS that's how you do it right so one more is I will go\nyou do it right so one more is I will go\nyou do it right so one more is I will go to my previous video so in this video I\nto my previous video so in this video I\nto my previous video so in this video I would have discussed in depth on how you\nwould have discussed in depth on how you\nwould have discussed in depth on how you can get location or can request\ncan get location or can request\ncan get location or can request permission from the user and what are\npermission from the user and what are\npermission from the user and what are the different types of locations they\nthe different types of locations they\nthe different types of locations they are available so please check out this\nare available so please check out this\nare available so please check out this particular guide so that uh in the\nparticular guide so that uh in the\nparticular guide so that uh in the Android site so in the Android so if I\nAndroid site so in the Android so if I\nAndroid site so in the Android so if I go to uh think Source Main and Android\ngo to uh think Source Main and Android\ngo to uh think Source Main and Android XML here you would have F location and\nXML here you would have F location and\nXML here you would have F location and course location you should have this\ncourse location you should have this\ncourse location you should have this here so that your app will uh your app\nhere so that your app will uh your app\nhere so that your app will uh your app will automatically know get location\nwill automatically know get location\nwill automatically know get location like ask location to the end user and\nlike ask location to the end user and\nlike ask location to the end user and you can also use the library called\nyou can also use the library called\nyou can also use the library called react native permissions to do that as\nreact native permissions to do that as\nreact native permissions to do that as well in iOS so if I go to uh iOS and\nwell in iOS so if I go to uh iOS and\nwell in iOS so if I go to uh iOS and then in the info. P list you can see I\nthen in the info. P list you can see I\nthen in the info.

coordinate from I think color uh let's\ncoordinate from I think color uh let's\ncoordinate from I think color uh let's go\ngo\ngo here to here and then the\nhere to here and then the\nhere to here and then the marker so marker component you can tap\nmarker so marker component you can tap\nmarker so marker component you can tap on that marker component and get this\non that marker component and get this\non that marker component and get this spin color okay so for this one I'm\nspin color okay so for this one I'm\nspin color okay so for this one I'm going to use\npink or purple is purple is there okay\npink or purple is purple is there okay pink color and then for user I will use\npink color and then for user I will use\npink color and then for user I will use blue if I do that let's see what happens\nblue if I do that let's see what happens\nblue if I do that let's see what happens okay we have that purple and then we\nokay we have that purple and then we\nokay we have that purple and then we also have blue okay so I can zoom in\nalso have blue okay so I can zoom in\nalso have blue okay so I can zoom in further this is outside somewhere so I'm\nfurther this is outside somewhere so I'm\nfurther this is outside somewhere so I'm going to change it to\ngoing to change it to\ngoing to change it to nine okay hey this is superb okay so the\nnine okay hey this is superb okay so the\nnine okay hey this is superb okay so the restaurant is somewhere in the city and\nrestaurant is somewhere in the city and\nrestaurant is somewhere in the city and then the user is somewhere in outside\nthen the user is somewhere in outside\nthen the user is somewhere in outside Berkley right now\nBerkley right now\nBerkley right now what uh so we have the markers ready the\nwhat uh so we have the markers ready the\nwhat uh so we have the markers ready the next step is to add uh like next step is\nnext step is to add uh like next step is\nnext step is to add uh like next step is to get the uh driver location so for\nto get the uh driver location so for\nto get the uh driver location so for that okay so we have the driver so let's\nthat okay so we have the driver so let's\nthat okay so we have the driver so let's let's change this to restaurant rest\nlet's change this to restaurant rest\nlet's change this to restaurant rest restant and\nrestant and\nrestant and then use this change this to what\nthen use this change this to what\nthen use this change this to what 85 change this from this to red and we\n85 change this from this to red and we\n85 change this from this to

right what what I would have done is uh like in the\nwhat I would have done is uh like in the\nwhat I would have done is uh like in the set watch ID right so like when the user\nset watch ID right so like when the user\nset watch ID right so like when the user Taps on this I can use so like for\nTaps on this I can use so like for\nTaps on this I can use so like for example the the location is not

that I'm going to show you that it works\nthat I'm going to show you that it works\nthat I'm going to show you that it works so for this to work create a new table\nso for this to work create a new table\nso for this to work create a new table in superway so I'm going to use\nin superway so I'm going to use\nin superway so I'm going to use locations locations and then what I'm\nlocations locations and then what I'm\nlocations locations and then what I'm going to do I'm going to have something\ngoing to do I'm going to have something\ngoing to do I'm going to have something like uh

If you are able and willing to contribute, please read the guidelines.\n\nInstallation\n\nSee Installation Instructions.\n\nSee Setup Instructions for the Included Example Project.\n\nCompatibility\nReact Native Compatibility\nVersion Requirements:\nCompatibility\nFabric (New Architecture)\nVersion\tReact Native Requirement\n1.26.1+\t>= 0.81.1\n1.26.0 and below\t>= 0.76\nOld Architecture\nVersion\tReact Native Requirement\n1.14.0 - 1.20.1\t>= 0.74\n< 1.14.0\t>= 0.64.3\nComponent API\n\n<MapView /> Component API\n\n<Marker /> Component API\n\n<Callout /> Component API\n\n<Polygon /> Component API\n\n<Polyline /> Component API\n\n<Circle /> Component API\n\n<Overlay /> Component API\n\n<Heatmap /> Component API\n\n<Geojson /> Component API\n\nGeneral Usage\nimport MapView from 'react-native-maps';\n\nor\n\nvar MapView = require('react-native-maps');\n\nThis MapView component is built so that features on the map (such as Markers, Polygons, etc.) are specified as children of the MapView itself. This provides an intuitive and react-like API for declaratively controlling features on the map.\n\nRendering a Map with an initial region\nMapView\n<MapView\n  initialRegion={{\n    latitude: 37.78825,\n    longitude: -122.4324,\n    latitudeDelta: 0.0922,\n    longitudeDelta: 0.0421,\n  }}\n/>\nUsing a MapView while controlling the region as state\ngetInitialState() {\n  return {\n    region: {\n      latitude: 37.78825,\n      longitude: -122.4324,\n      latitudeDelta: 0.0922,\n      longitudeDelta: 0.0421,\n    },\n  };\n}\n\nonRegionChange(region) {\n  this.setState({ region });\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <MapView\n      region={this.state.region}\n      onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}\n    />\n  );\n}\nRendering a list of markers on a map\nimport {Marker} from 'react-native-maps';\n\n<MapView region={this.state.region} onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}>\n  {this.state.markers.map((marker, index) => (\n    <Marker\n      key={index}\n      coordinate={marker.latlng}\n      title={marker.title}\n      description={marker.description}\n    />\n  ))}\n</MapView>;\nRendering a Marker with a custom image\nYou need to generate an png image with various resolution (lets call them custom_pin) - for more information go to Android, iOS\nput all images in Android drawables and iOS assets dir\nNow you can use the following code:\n<Marker\n  coordinate={{latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude}}\n  image={{uri: 'custom_pin'}}\n/>\n\nNote: You can also pass the image binary data like image={require('custom_pin.png')}, but this will not scale good with the different screen sizes.\n\nRendering a Marker with a custom view\n\nNote: This has performance implications, if you wish for a simpler solution go with a custom image (save your self the headache)\n\n<Marker coordinate={{latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude}}>\n  <MyCustomMarkerView {...marker} />\n</Marker>\nRendering a custom Marker with a custom Callout\nimport {Callout} from 'react-native-maps';\n\n<Marker coordinate={marker.latlng}>\n  <MyCustomMarkerView {...marker} />\n  <Callout>\n    <MyCustomCalloutView {...marker} />\n  </Callout>\n</Marker>;\nDraggable Markers\n<MapView initialRegion={...}>\n  <Marker draggable\n    coordinate={this.state.x}\n    onDragEnd={(e) => this.setState({ x: e.nativeEvent.coordinate })}\n  />\n</MapView>\nUsing a custom Tile Overlay\nTile Overlay using tile server\nimport {UrlTile} from 'react-native-maps';\n\n<MapView region={this.state.region} onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}>\n  <UrlTile\n    /**\n     * The url template of the tile server. The patterns {x} {y} {z} will be replaced at runtime\n     * For example, http://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\n     */\n    urlTemplate={this.state.urlTemplate}\n    /**\n     * The maximum zoom level for this tile overlay. Corresponds to the maximumZ setting in\n     * MKTileOverlay. iOS only.\n     */\n    maximumZ={19}\n    /**\n     * flipY allows tiles with inverted y coordinates (origin at bottom left of map)\n     * to be used. Its default value is false.\n     */\n    flipY={false}\n  />\n</MapView>;\n\nFor Android: add the following line in your AndroidManifest.xml\n\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n\nFor IOS: configure App Transport Security in your app\n\nTile Overlay using local tiles\n\nTiles can be stored locally within device using xyz tiling scheme and displayed as tile overlay as well. This is usefull especially for offline map usage when tiles are available for selected map region within device storage.\n\nimport {LocalTile} from 'react-native-maps';\n\n<MapView region={this.state.region} onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}>\n  <LocalTile\n    /**\n     * The path template of the locally stored tiles. The patterns {x} {y} {z} will be replaced at runtime\n     * For example, /storage/emulated/0/mytiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\n     */\n    pathTemplate={this.state.pathTemplate}\n    /**\n     * The size of provided local tiles (usually 256 or 512).\n     */\n    tileSize={256}\n  />\n</MapView>;\n\nFor Android: LocalTile is still just overlay over original map tiles. It means that if device is online, underlying tiles will be still downloaded. If original tiles download/display is not desirable set mapType to 'none'. For example:\n\n<MapView\n  mapType={Platform.OS == \"android\" ? \"none\" : \"standard\"}\n>\n\n\nSee OSM Wiki for how to download tiles for offline usage.\n\nOverlaying other components on the map\n\nPlace components that you wish to overlay MapView underneath the MapView closing tag. Absolutely position these elements.\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <MapView\n      region={this.state.region}\n    />\n    <OverlayComponent\n      style={{position: \"absolute\", bottom: 50}}\n    />\n  );\n}\nCustomizing the map style (Google Maps Only)\n\nThe <MapView provider=\"google\" googleMapId=\"yourStyledMapId\" /> Google Maps on iOS and Android supports styling via google cloud platform, the styled maps are published under a googleMapId, by simply setting the property googleMapId to the MapView you can use that styled map more info here: google map id\n\nMapView Events\n\nThe <MapView /> component and its child components have several events that you can subscribe to. This example displays some of them in a log as a demonstration.\n\n \n\nTracking Region / Location\n\n \n\nProgrammatically Changing Region\n\nOne can change the mapview's position using refs and component methods, or by passing in an updated region prop. The component methods will allow one to animate to a given position like the native API could.\n\n \n\nChanging the style of the map\n\nArbitrary React Views as Markers\n\n \n\nUsing the MapView with the Animated API\n\nThe <MapView /> component can be made to work with the Animated API, having the entire region prop be declared as an animated value. This allows one to animate the zoom and position of the MapView along with other gestures, giving a nice feel.\n\nFurther, Marker views can use the animated API to enhance the effect.\n\n \n\nIssue: Since android needs to render its marker views as a bitmap, the animations APIs may not be compatible with the Marker views. Not sure if this can be worked around yet or not.\n\nMarkers' coordinates can also be animated, as shown in this example:\n\n \n\nPolygon Creator\n\n \n\nOther Overlays\n\nSo far, <Circle />, <Polygon />, and <Polyline /> are available to pass in as children to the <MapView /> component.\n\n \n\nGradient Polylines (iOS MapKit only)\n\nGradient polylines can be created using the strokeColors prop of the <Polyline> component.\n\nDefault Markers\n\nDefault markers will be rendered unless a custom marker is specified. One can optionally adjust the color of the default marker by using the pinColor prop.\n\n \n\nCustom Callouts\n\nCallouts to markers can be completely arbitrary react views, similar to markers. As a result, they can be interacted with like any other view.\n\nAdditionally, you can fall back to the standard behavior of just having a title/description through the <Marker />'s title and description props.\n\nCustom callout views can be the entire tooltip bubble, or just the content inside of the system default bubble.\n\nTo handle press on specific subview of callout use <CalloutSubview /> with onPress. See Callouts.js example.\n\n \n\nImage-based Markers\n\nMarkers can be customized by just using images, and specified using the image prop.\n\nDraggable Markers\n\nMarkers are draggable, and emit continuous drag events to update other UI during drags.\n\n \n\nLite Mode ( Android )\n\nEnable lite mode on Android with liteMode prop. Ideal when having multiple maps in a View or ScrollView.\n\nOn Poi Click (Google Maps Only)\n\nPoi are clickable, you can catch the event to get its information (usually to get the full detail from Google Place using the placeId).\n\nAnimated Region\n\nThe MapView can accept an AnimatedRegion value as its region prop. This allows you to utilize the Animated API to control the map's center and zoom.\n\nimport MapView, { AnimatedRegion, Animated } from 'react-native-maps';\n\ngetInitialState() {\n  return {\n    region: new AnimatedRegion({\n      latitude: LATITUDE,\n      longitude: LONGITUDE,\n      latitudeDelta: LATITUDE_DELTA,\n      longitudeDelta: LONGITUDE_DELTA,\n    }),\n  };\n}\n\nonRegionChange(region) {\n  this.state.region.setValue(region);\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Animated\n      region={this.state.region}\n      onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}\n    />\n  );\n}\nAnimated Marker Position\n\nMarkers can also accept an AnimatedRegion value as a coordinate.\n\nimport MapView, { AnimatedRegion, MarkerAnimated } from 'react-native-maps';\n\ngetInitialState() {\n  return {\n    coordinate: new AnimatedRegion({\n      latitude: LATITUDE,\n      longitude: LONGITUDE,\n    }),\n  };\n}\n\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n  const duration = 500\n\n  if (this.props.coordinate !== nextProps.coordinate) {\n    if (Platform.OS === 'android') {\n      if (this.marker) {\n        this.marker.animateMarkerToCoordinate(\n          nextProps.coordinate,\n          duration\n        );\n      }\n    } else {\n      this.state.coordinate.timing({\n        ...nextProps.coordinate,\n        useNativeDriver: true, // defaults to false if not passed explicitly\n        duration\n      }).start();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <MapView initialRegion={...}>\n      <MarkerAnimated\n        ref={marker => { this.marker = marker }}\n        coordinate={this.state.coordinate}\n      />\n    </MapView>\n  );\n}\nTake Snapshot of map\nimport MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';\n\ngetInitialState() {\n  return {\n    coordinate: {\n      latitude: LATITUDE,\n      longitude: LONGITUDE,\n    },\n  };\n}\n\ntakeSnapshot () {\n  // 'takeSnapshot' takes a config object with the\n  // following options\n  const snapshot = this.map.takeSnapshot({\n    width: 300,      // optional, when omitted the view-width is used\n    height: 300,     // optional, when omitted the view-height is used\n    region: {..},    // iOS only, optional region to render\n    format: 'png',   // image formats: 'png', 'jpg' (default: 'png')\n    quality: 0.8,    // image quality: 0..1 (only relevant for jpg, default: 1)\n    result: 'file'   // result types: 'file', 'base64' (default: 'file')\n  });\n  snapshot.then((uri) => {\n    this.setState({ mapSnapshot: uri });\n  });\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <MapView initialRegion={...} ref={map => { this.map = map }}>\n        <Marker coordinate={this.state.coordinate} />\n      </MapView>\n      <Image source={{ uri: this.state.mapSnapshot.uri }} />\n      <TouchableOpacity onPress={this.takeSnapshot}>\n        Take Snapshot\n      </TouchableOpacity>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\nZoom to Specified Markers\n\nPass an array of marker identifiers to have the map re-focus.\n\n \n\nZoom to Specified Coordinates\n\nPass an array of coordinates to focus a map region on said coordinates.\n\nTroubleshooting\nMy map is blank\nMake sure that you have properly installed react-native-maps.\nCheck in the logs if there is more informations about the issue.\nTry setting the style of the MapView to an absolute position with top, left, right and bottom values set.\nMake sure you have enabled Google Maps API in Google developer console\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  map: {\n    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,\n  },\n});\n<MapView\n  style={styles.map}\n  // other props\n/>\nInputs don't focus\nWhen inputs don't focus or elements don't respond to tap, look at the order of the view hierarchy, sometimes the issue could be due to ordering of rendered components, prefer putting MapView as the first component.\n\nBad:\n\n<View>\n  <TextInput />\n  <MapView />\n</View>\n\nGood:\n\n<View>\n  <MapView />\n  <TextInput />\n</View>\nChildren Components Not Re-Rendering\n\nComponents that aren't declared by this library (Ex: Markers, Polyline) must not be children of the MapView component due to MapView's unique rendering methodology. Have your custom components / views outside the MapView component and position absolute to ensure they only re-render as needed. Example: Bad:\n\n<View style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}>\n  <MapView style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}>\n    <View style={{position: 'absolute', top: 100, left: 50}} />\n  </MapView>\n</View>\n\nGood:\n\n<View style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}>\n  <MapView style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject} />\n  <View style={{position: 'absolute', top: 100, left: 50}} />\n</View>\n\nSource: https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/issues/1901\n\nCrashing with EXC_BAD_ACCESS on iOS when switching apps\n\n<MapView> using Apple Maps in mapType: \"standard\" will sometimes crash when you background the app or switch into another app. This is only an issue in XCode using Metal API Validation, and won't happen in production.

We will use the tabs template as this will give use file-based routing with Expo Router - but nothing you really need to worry about.\n\nCommand\nnpx create-expo-app mapApp -t tabs\ncd mapApp\nnpx expo install react-native-maps\n\nMore important is adding the react-native-maps package which allows us to easily present a map in our app.\n\nThis package comes with support for the Expo Go app, so we can put it to the test right away!\n\nSetting up the Map\n\nThe fastest way to seeing our map is by quickly spinning up a layout and then displaying the map.\n\nStart by deleting all the default stuff in the app folder and create a new file called _layout.tsx with the following content:\n\napp/_layout.tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Stack } from 'expo-router';\n\nconst Layout = () => (\n\t<Stack>\n\t\t<Stack.Screen name=\"index\" options={{ title: 'Home' }} />\n\t</Stack>\n);\n\nexport default Layout;\n\nThis will create a simple layout with a single screen called index and a title of Home.\n\nNext, we will create a new file called index.tsx in the app folder with the following content:\n\napp/index.tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport MapView from 'react-native-maps';\nimport { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default function App() {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n\t\t\t<MapView style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill} />\n\t\t</View>\n\t);\n}\n\nAnd voila, we have a map in our app!\n\nIt’s that easy.\n\nWorking with React Native MapView\n\nNow only displaying the map is probably not enough, so let’s cover some basic examples of how to interact with the map.\n\nI highly recommend you also take a look at the react-native-maps Github repository for all available props and methods.\n\nStart by defining an INITIAL_REGION for the map. This will automatically focus the map on the given region.\n\nIf you later want to change this, you can set up a state variable and attach it to the region prop of the MapView.\n\nAdditionally we add a useEffect hook to set the title of the screen to Map and add a button to the header to focus the map on a specific location.\n\nThis will use the ref of the MapView to call the animateToRegion method which will focus the map on the given region.\n\napp/index.tsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\nimport MapView, { Callout, Marker, PROVIDER_GOOGLE, Region } from 'react-native-maps';\nimport { Alert, StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';\nimport { useNavigation } from 'expo-router';\n\nconst INITIAL_REGION = {\n\tlatitude: 37.33,\n\tlongitude: -122,\n\tlatitudeDelta: 2,\n\tlongitudeDelta: 2\n};\n\nexport default function App() {\n\tconst navigation = useNavigation();\n\n\tuseEffect(() => {\n\t\tnavigation.setOptions({\n\t\t\theaderRight: () => (\n\t\t\t\t<TouchableOpacity onPress={focusMap}>\n\t\t\t\t\t<View style={{ padding: 10 }}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Text>Focus</Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t</View>\n\t\t\t\t</TouchableOpacity>\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t});\n\t}, []);\n\n\tconst focusMap = () => {\n\t\tconst GreenBayStadium = {\n\t\t\tlatitude: 44.5013,\n\t\t\tlongitude: -88.0622,\n\t\t\tlatitudeDelta: 0.1,\n\t\t\tlongitudeDelta: 0.1\n\t\t};\n\n\t\tmapRef.current?.animateToRegion(GreenBayStadium);\n\n\t\t// Or change the camera with a duration\n\t\t// mapRef.current?.animateCamera({ center: GreenBayStadium, zoom: 10 }, { duration: 2000 });\n\t};\n\n\tconst onRegionChange = (region: Region) => {\n\t\tconsole.log(region);\n\t};\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n\t\t\t<MapView\n\t\t\t\tstyle={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}\n\t\t\t\tinitialRegion={INITIAL_REGION}\n\t\t\t\tshowsUserLocation\n\t\t\t\tshowsMyLocationButton\n\t\t\t\tprovider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE}\n\t\t\t\tref={mapRef}\n\t\t\t\tonRegionChangeComplete={onRegionChange}\n\t\t\t></MapView>\n\t\t</View>\n\t);\n}\n\nTo see some more cool stuff I also added the PROVIDER_GOOGLE prop which will use Google Maps instead of Apple Maps on iOS.\n\nAdditionally, I added the showsUserLocation and showsMyLocationButton props which will show the user location and a button to focus the map on the user location.\n\nFinally I added a onRegionChangeComplete prop which will be called whenever the user changes the region of the map.\n\nAgain, highly recommend you check out the MapView component docs to read about all the available props.\n\nThis is already a lot of stuff, but we can do more!\n\nDisplaying Markers on the Map\n\nIn many scenarios you want to display markers on the map. This can be done with the Marker component.\n\nI’ve created a simple file marker.ts in the assets folder which contains some markers for the map:\n\napp/assets/markers.ts\nexport const markers = [\n\t// San Francisco\n\t{\n\t\tlatitude: 37.7749,\n\t\tlongitude: -122.4194,\n\t\tlatitudeDelta: 0.01,\n\t\tlongitudeDelta: 0.01,\n\t\tname: 'San Francisco City Center'\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tlatitude: 37.8077,\n\t\tlongitude: -122.475,\n\t\tlatitudeDelta: 0.01,\n\t\tlongitudeDelta: 0.01,\n\t\tname: 'Golden Gate Bridge'\n\t}\n];\n\nWe can now load that marker information and display it on the map,\n\nFor this, we simply render all of the marker right inside the MapView component:\n\napp/index.tsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\nimport MapView, { Callout, Marker, PROVIDER_GOOGLE, Region } from 'react-native-maps';\nimport { Alert, StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';\nimport { useNavigation } from 'expo-router';\nimport { markers } from '../assets/markers';\n\nconst INITIAL_REGION = {\n\tlatitude: 37.33,\n\tlongitude: -122,\n\tlatitudeDelta: 2,\n\tlongitudeDelta: 2\n};\n\nexport default function App() {\n\tconst mapRef = useRef<any>(null);\n\tconst navigation = useNavigation();\n\n\tuseEffect(() => {\n\t\tnavigation.setOptions({\n\t\t\theaderRight: () => (\n\t\t\t\t<TouchableOpacity onPress={focusMap}>\n\t\t\t\t\t<View style={{ padding: 10 }}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Text>Focus</Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t</View>\n\t\t\t\t</TouchableOpacity>\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t});\n\t}, []);\n\n\tconst focusMap = () => {\n\t\tconst GreenBayStadium = {\n\t\t\tlatitude: 44.5013,\n\t\t\tlongitude: -88.0622,\n\t\t\tlatitudeDelta: 0.1,\n\t\t\tlongitudeDelta: 0.1\n\t\t};\n\n\t\tmapRef.current?.animateToRegion(GreenBayStadium);\n\t\t// mapRef.current?.animateCamera({ center: GreenBayStadium, zoom: 10 }, { duration: 2000 });\n\t};\n\n\tconst onMarkerSelected = (marker: any) => {\n\t\tAlert.alert(marker.name);\n\t};\n\n\tconst calloutPressed = (ev: any) => {\n\t\tconsole.log(ev);\n\t};\n\n\tconst onRegionChange = (region: Region) => {\n\t\tconsole.log(region);\n\t};\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n\t\t\t<MapView\n\t\t\t\tstyle={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}\n\t\t\t\tinitialRegion={INITIAL_REGION}\n\t\t\t\tshowsUserLocation\n\t\t\t\tshowsMyLocationButton\n\t\t\t\tprovider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE}\n\t\t\t\tref={mapRef}\n\t\t\t\tonRegionChangeComplete={onRegionChange}\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t{markers.map((marker, index) => (\n\t\t\t\t\t<Marker\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkey={index}\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttitle={marker.name}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoordinate={marker}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonPress={() => onMarkerSelected(marker)}\n\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Callout onPress={calloutPressed}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<View style={{ padding: 10 }}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Text style={{ fontSize: 24 }}>Hello</Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</View>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</Callout>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Marker>\n\t\t\t\t))}\n\t\t\t</MapView>\n\t\t</View>\n\t);\n}\n\nAs another addition I added a Callout component to the Marker which will display a callout when the marker is pressed.\n\nThis is optional, but I wanted to show you what’s possible if you really want to customise your React Native Map - and this is only the top of the iceberg!\n\nConclusion\n\nAdding a map to your React Native app is really easy with Expo and the react-native-maps package.\n\nBe aware that there is a whole lot more to uncover about the maps component, so make sure you also check out the full React Native Maps course here on Galaxies!\n\nCourse\nPRO\nReact Native Maps & Google Places API\nLearn how to use React Native Maps in your React Native app.\nTypescript\nGoogle Places\nGoogle APIs\nSimon Grimm\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCreating the React Native App with Expo\nSetting up the Map\nWorking with React Native MapView\nDisplaying Markers on the Map\nConclusion\nStart for Free\nTeam Accounts\nCourses\nTutorials\nPodcast\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\n\n© 2024 Galaxies.dev.

For example, you could use this data to show users what is around them, offer exclusive deals for products and services in their area, and much more. We’ll cover the following topics:\n\nWhat is React Native Maps?\nSetting up the map default view\nUsing React Native Maps with the useState Hook\nAdding a marker in React Native Maps\nCustomizing the map marker\nStyling the map\nGetting the current location or a specific coordinate\nUsing <Polyline /> in React Native Maps\nUsing the Google Maps Direction API\n\nFortunately, if you have a React application, implementing maps is a breeze using the react-native-maps library.\n\n🚀 Sign up for The Replay newsletter\n\nThe Replay is a weekly newsletter for dev and engineering leaders.\n\nDelivered once a week, it's your curated guide to the most important conversations around frontend dev, emerging AI tools, and the state of modern software.\n\nWhat is React Native Maps?\n\nReact Native Maps is a component system for maps that ships with platform-native code that needs to be compiled together with React Native. In this guide, we’ll demonstrate how to integrate Google Maps into your React Native application and introduce you to fundamental components such as <MapView /> and <Marker>.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nInstallation\n\nBefore rendering our MapView component, we first need to get an API key to incorporate Google Maps functionality in our app. To do so, procure your API secrets using these steps.\n\nNext, under android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml, add this block of code:\n\n<application>\n   <!-- You will only need to add this meta-data tag, but make sure it's a child of application -->\n   <meta-data\n     android:name=\"com.google.android.geo.API_KEY\"\n     android:value=\"YOUR_API_KEY\"/> <!-- Your key goes here. -->\n \n   <!-- You will also only need to add this uses-library tag -->\n   <uses-library android:name=\"org.apache.http.legacy\" android:required=\"false\"/>\n</application>\n\nThis will connect our SDK key to the React Native project.\n\nNext, run the following command to install react-native-maps in your project.\n\nyarn add react-native-maps -E\nnpm install react-native-maps\n#Expo requires a different version of this package.\n# so if you are using Expo, run this instead:\nexpo install react-native-maps\nSetting up the map default view\n\nRemove all the default code from the App.js file and import the <MapView /> component from react-native-maps. Inside the component, render the <MapView /> component.\n\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from \"react-native\";\nimport MapView from \"react-native-maps\";\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n    {/*Render our MapView*/}\n      <MapView\n        style={styles.map}\n        //specify our coordinates.\n        initialRegion={{\n          latitude: 37.78825,\n          longitude: -122.4324,\n          latitudeDelta: 0.0922,\n          longitudeDelta: 0.0421,\n        }}\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n//create our styling code:\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,\n    flex: 1, //the container will fill the whole screen.\n    justifyContent: \"flex-end\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n  },\n  map: {\n    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,\n  },\n});\n\nThe initialRegion prop shows the region that is to be displayed on the map when the component mounts. The initialRegion value cannot be changed after it has been initialized.\n\nDon’t forget to add the style property to specify the dimensions; otherwise, you’ll end up with a white screen. The value { flex: 1 } will ensure that the <MapView /> takes up the entire screen.\n\nYou’ll need to pass an object with the latitude, longitude, and delta values of a region to the initialRegion prop. The latitudeDelta and longitudeDelta properties specify how much the area on the map must be zoomed. To change the region, use the region prop.\n\nUsing React Native Maps with the useState Hook\n\nTo change the region with the useState Hook, use the onRegionChangeComplete prop to set the new region into the state. The onRegionChangeComplete is a callback prop that runs when the user has stopped panning around the map.\n\n//extra code removed for brevity.\n//create a Hook to store our region data.\nconst [region, setRegion] = useState({\n  latitude: 51.5079145,\n  longitude: -0.0899163,\n  latitudeDelta: 0.01,\n  longitudeDelta: 0.01,\n});\nreturn (\n  <View style={styles.container}>\n    <MapView\n      style={styles.map}\n      initialRegion={{\n        latitude: 37.78825,\n        longitude: -122.4324,\n        latitudeDelta: 0.0922,\n        longitudeDelta: 0.0421,\n      }}\n      //onRegionChangeComplete runs when the user stops dragging MapView\n      onRegionChangeComplete={(region) => setRegion(region)}\n    />\n    {/*Display user's current region:*/}\n    <Text style={styles.text}>Current latitude: {region.latitude}</Text>\n    <Text style={styles.text}>Current longitude: {region.longitude}</Text>\n  </View>\n);\n\nAdding a marker in React Native Maps\n\nStart by importing Marker from react-native-maps.\n\nimport { Marker } from \"react-native-maps\";\n\nNext, render the <Marker /> component as a child of <MapView />. Pass the coordinate for the marker in the coordinate prop.\n\nimport { Marker } from \"react-native-maps\";\nconst tokyoRegion = {\n  latitude: 35.6762,\n  longitude: 139.6503,\n  latitudeDelta: 0.01,\n  longitudeDelta: 0.01,\n};\nreturn (\n  <View style={styles.container}>\n    <MapView\n      style={styles.map}\n      initialRegion={tokyoRegion} //your region data goes here.\n    >\n      {/*Make sure the Marker component is a child of MapView. Otherwise it won't render*/}\n      <Marker coordinate={tokyoRegion} />\n    </MapView>\n  </View>\n);\n\nThe marker should now be visible, as shown below.\n\nOver 200k developers use LogRocket to create better digital experiences\nLearn more →\n\nYou can add n number of markers to the map and pass it as a direct child to the <MapView /> component.\n\nHere is an example of multiple Marker components in the same MapView:\n\n<MapView\n  ref={mapRef}\n  style={styles.map}\n  initialRegion={tokyoRegion}\n  onRegionChangeComplete={(region) => setRegion(region)}\n>\n  <Marker coordinate={tokyoRegion} />\n  {/*marker to a nearby location */}\n  <Marker\n    coordinate={{\n      latitude: 35.67714827145542,\n      longitude: 139.6551462687416,\n    }}\n  />\n</MapView>;\n\nCustomizing the map marker\nChanging the color\n\nTo change the color of the marker, use the pinColor prop.\n\n<Marker\n  coordinate={tokyoRegion}\n  pinColor=\"green\"\n/>\n\nHere, we are changing the color of the pin to green :\n\nChanging the marker image\n\nYou can also add a custom marker image by passing the image prop to the <Marker /> component.\n\n<Marker\n  coordinate={{ latitude: 52.5200066, longitude: 13.404954 }}\n  image={require(\"./japaneseFlag.png\")} //uses relative file path. \n/>\n\nChanging the marker view\n\nreact-native-maps also allows developers use custom marker views. This might be helpful in situations where you want to indicate a location using a symbol. An example might be to display a Car component to show a position of a car dealer.\n\nTo do so, first start by writing some code to build a custom component, like so:\n\n//create our custom marker component.\nfunction CustomMarker() {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.marker}>\n      <Text style={styles.color}>Tokyo</Text>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n//styles for our custom marker.\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  marker: {\n    paddingVertical: 10,\n    paddingHorizontal: 30,\n    backgroundColor: \"#007bff\",\n    borderColor: \"#eee\",\n    borderRadius: 5,\n    elevation: 10,\n  },\n  text: {\n  color: \"#fff\",   \n  },\n});\n\nNext, incorporate CustomMarker into your project.\n\n export default function App() {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <MapView style={styles.map} initialRegion={tokyoRegion}>\n        <Marker coordinate={tokyoRegion}>\n          {/* CustomMarker has to be a child of Marker*/}\n          <CustomMarker />\n        </Marker>\n      </MapView>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nStyling the map\n\nGenerate the JSON object you’ll use to design the map from the Google style generator. Next, pass the generated style object to the customMapStyle prop of the <MapView /> component.\n\nimport React, { useState, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from \"react-native\";\nimport MapView, { Marker } from \"react-native-maps\";\n\nconst mapStyle = []; //map styles go here!\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <MapView\n        style={styles.map}\n        initialRegion={tokyoRegion}\n        customMapStyle={mapStyle} //plug in our custom style into the customMapStyle prop.\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nYou can ignore the mapStyle variable — since we are generating the map style using the generator, you only need to paste the generated JSON object into your code and send it to the <MapView /> component.\n\nAs you can see, the map style changed from the default light theme to a dark theme.\n\nGetting the current location or a specific coordinate\n\nWhat if you want to animate to a particular coordinate?\n\nFirst, create a reference to <MapView /> using the useRef() Hook:\n\nimport { useRef } from \"react\";\n\nconst mapRef = useRef(null);\n<MapView\n  ref={mapRef} //assign our ref to this MapView\n  /*further code.. */\n/>\n\nThis means that we can now execute methods to control our MapView component.\n\nNext, add this block:\n\n//extra code removed for brevity\n//destination coordinates\nconst tokyoRegion = {\n  latitude: 35.6762,\n  longitude: 139.6503,\n  latitudeDelta: 0.01,\n  longitudeDelta: 0.01,\n};\nconst goToTokyo = () => {\n  //Animate the user to new region. Complete this animation in 3 seconds\n  mapRef.current.animateToRegion(tokyoRegion, 3 * 1000);\n};\nreturn (\n  <View style={styles.container}>\n    <Button onPress={() => goToTokyo()} title=\"Go to Tokyo\" />\n  </View>\n);\n\nHere is the breakdown of this snippet:\n\nThe useRef() Hook returns a mutable ref object whose current property has the value of the passed argument. If the value of the current property is undefined, that means the component is not yet mounted. Now, you can access any of the <MapView /> methods using mapRef.current.\n\nThe animateToRegion() method accepts any two parameters: the destination coordinates (in this case, tokyoRegion) and the animation duration in milliseconds.\n\nIn the end, the code in your App.js file should look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const mapRef = useRef(null);\n  const [region, setRegion] = useState({\n    latitude: 51.5079145,\n    longitude: -0.0899163,\n    latitudeDelta: 0.01,\n    longitudeDelta: 0.01,\n  });\n  const tokyoRegion = {\n    latitude: 35.6762,\n    longitude: 139.6503,\n    latitudeDelta: 0.01,\n    longitudeDelta: 0.01,\n  };\n  const goToTokyo = () => {\n    //complete this animation in 3 seconds\n    mapRef.current.animateToRegion(tokyoRegion, 3 * 1000);\n  };\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <MapView\n        ref={mapRef}\n        style={styles.map}\n        initialRegion={{\n          latitude: 24.8607,\n          longitude: 67.0011,\n          latitudeDelta: 0.0922,\n          longitudeDelta: 0.0421,\n        }}\n        onRegionChangeComplete={(region) => setRegion(region)}\n      />\n      <Button onPress={() => goToTokyo()} title=\"Go to Tokyo\" />\n      <Text style={styles.text}>Current latitude{region.latitude}</Text>\n      <Text style={styles.text}>Current longitude{region.longitude}</Text>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: \"flex-end\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n  },\n  map: {\n    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,\n  },\n  text: {\n    fontSize: 20,\n    backgroundColor: \"lightblue\",\n  },\n});\nUsing <polyline /> in React Native Maps\n\nYou can use the <Polyline /> component from the react-native-maps library to create lines between multiple coordinates. It accepts an array of coordinates in its coordinates prop. You can also specify additional props for styling purposes, such as strokeWidth, strokeColor, etc.\n\nLet’s create a path between Tokyo and Chiba.\n\nimport { Polyline } from \"react-native-maps\";\n\nconst tokyoRegion = {\n  latitude: 35.6762,\n  longitude: 139.6503,\n  latitudeDelta: 0.01,\n  longitudeDelta: 0.01,\n};\nconst chibaRegion = {\n  latitude: 35.6074,\n  longitude: 140.1065,\n  latitudeDelta: 0.01,\n  longitudeDelta: 0.01,\n};\n\nreturn (\n  <View style={styles.container}>\n    <MapView style={styles.map} initialRegion={tokyoRegion}>\n      <Polyline\n        coordinates={[tokyoRegion, chibaRegion]} //specify our coordinates\n        strokeColor={\"#000\"}\n        strokeWidth={3}\n        lineDashPattern={[1]}\n      />\n    </MapView>\n  </View>\n);\n\nStore the coordinates for the locations in their respective variables and pass them in an array to the coordinates prop of the <Polyline /> component.\n\nIf you look at the results, the line is drawn directly between these coordinates and does not take into account the actual geographical paths and roads. To do that, you’ll need to establish multiple coordinates between the source and destination locations by using the Google Maps Direction API, which returns all possible routes between two places.\n\nUsing the Google Maps Direction API\n\nTo use the Direction API, you must first enable it for your project. Note that you need to have a valid billing address to use Google Cloud, otherwise the Directions feature won’t work.\n\nFirst, create a helper function called getDirections. Here, write the following code:\n\nimport {decode} from \"@mapbox/polyline\"; //please install this package before running!\nconst getDirections = async (startLoc, destinationLoc) => {\n  try {\n    const KEY = \"YOUR GOOGLE API KEY\"; //put your API key here.\n    //otherwise, you'll have an 'unauthorized' error.\n    let resp = await fetch(\n      `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=${startLoc}&destination=${destinationLoc}&key=${KEY}`\n    );\n    let respJson = await resp.json();\n    let points = decode(respJson.routes[0].overview_polyline.points);\n    console.log(points);\n    let coords = points.map((point, index) => {\n      return {\n        latitude: point[0],\n        longitude: point[1]\n      };\n    });\n    return coords;\n  } catch (error) {\n    return error;\n  }\n};\n\nThe decode() function will convert the encoded polyline points from the overview_polyline.points property into an array containing the latitude and longitude of all the coordinates.\n\nAs a result, this will allow the PolyLine component to read the location coordinates easily. Without it, react-native-maps throws an error.\n\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { View, Text } from \"react-native\";\nimport MapView, { Polyline } from \"react-native-maps\";\nimport { decode } from \"@mapbox/polyline\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [coords, setCoords] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    //fetch the coordinates and then store its value into the coords Hook.\n    getDirections(\"52.5200066,13.404954\", \"50.1109221,8.6821267\")\n      .then(coords => setCoords(coords))\n      .catch(err => console.log(\"Something went wrong\"));\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <MapView\n        style={{ flex: 1 }}\n        initialRegion={{\n          latitude: 52.5200066,\n          longitude: 13.404954,\n          latitudeDelta: 0.1,\n          longitudeDelta: 0.1\n        }}\n      >\n        {/* finally, render the Polyline component with the coords data */}\n        {coords.length > 0 && <Polyline coordinates={coords} />}\n      </MapView>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n\nConclusion\n\nYou should now have a basic understanding of how to implement maps and build custom features on top of the react-native-maps library. You can put these lessons to use in your work to build myriad types of applications, from taxi services, to restaurant finders, to delivery apps, and much more. The react-native-maps library makes it simple to integrate maps and is an essential player in the React Native ecosystem.\n\nLogRocket: Instantly identify and recreate issues in your React Native apps\n\nLogRocket's Galileo AI watches sessions for you and and surfaces the technical and usability issues holding back your React Native apps.\n\nLogRocket also helps you increase conversion rates and product usage by showing you exactly how users are interacting with your app. LogRocket's product analytics features surface the reasons why users don't complete a particular flow or don't adopt a new feature.\n\nStart proactively monitoring your React Native apps — try LogRocket for free.\n\n#react native\nStop guessing about your digital experience with LogRocket\nGet started for free\nRecent posts:\nShadcn UI adoption guide: Overview, examples, and alternatives\n\nExplore Shadcn UI, a reusable component collection.

pass your PIN color which will change my PIN color\ncolor which will change my PIN color\ncolor which will change my PIN color from red to Green okay I will save this\nfrom red to Green okay I will save this\nfrom red to Green okay I will save this same thing I will copy and paste it here\nsame thing I will copy and paste it here\nsame thing I will copy and paste it here and this will be for Destination so here\nand this will be for Destination so here\nand this will be for Destination so here if my destination is true that means\nif my destination is true that means\nif my destination is true that means destination is having some variable then\ndestination is having some variable then\ndestination is having some variable then it will show this I will save this and\nit will show this I will save this and\nit will show this I will save this and for now the title will be destination\nfor now the title will be destination\nfor now the title will be destination you can also set description and this\nyou can also set description and this\nyou can also set description and this will be blue we save this I will reload\nwill be blue we save this I will reload\nwill be blue we save this I will reload my app\nmy app\nmy app ation okay I've also added this\nation okay I've also added this\nation okay I've also added this condition here that is location that my\ncondition here that is location that my\ncondition here that is location that my if location is true then only I will get\nif location is true then only I will get\nif location is true then only I will get my marker now I will click on this\nmy marker now I will click on this\nmy marker now I will click on this choose source so here I am getting the\nchoose source so here I am getting the\nchoose source so here I am getting the message please choose source so now\nmessage please choose source so now\nmessage please choose source so now wherever I will click now it will be set\nwherever I will click now it will be set\nwherever I will click now it will be set inside the source so I'm clicking here\ninside the source so I'm clicking here\ninside the source so I'm clicking here okay it is green in color now I'm\nokay it is green in color now I'm\nokay it is green in color now I'm clicking on this choose destination uh\nclicking on this choose destination uh\nclicking on this choose destination uh yeah this text has been changed and when\nyeah this text has been changed and when\nyeah this text has been changed and when I click here uh yes it is giving me this\nI click here uh yes it is giving me this\nI click here uh yes it is giving me this blue blue color so this is also fine now\nblue blue color so this is also fine now\nblue blue color so this is also fine now what we have to do whenever both these\nwhat we have to do whenever both these\nwhat we have to do whenever both these condition are true we have to draw the\ncondition are true we have to draw the\ncondition are true we have to draw the line between them let's add that\nline between them let's add that\nline between them let's add that condition I will come here and after the\ncondition I will come here and after the\ncondition I will come here and after the destination I will add one condition\ndestination I will add one condition\ndestination I will add one condition that is if my\nthat is if my\nthat is if my source and my destination both are true\nsource and my destination both are true\nsource and my destination both are true that means user has selected both the\nthat means user has selected both the\nthat means user has selected both the location then I will show here polyline\nlocation then I will show here polyline\nlocation then I will show here polyline which is also provided by react native\nwhich is also provided by react native\nwhich is also provided by react native you will have to import that and in this\nyou will have to import that and in this\nyou will have to import that and in this I will pass coordinates and what will be\nI will pass coordinates and what will be\nI will pass coordinates and what will be the coordinate here we have to pass\nthe coordinate here we have to pass\nthe coordinate here we have to pass array of coordinate which will be Source\narray of coordinate which will be Source\narray of coordinate which will be Source the first one will be source and second\nthe first one will be source and second\nthe first one will be source and second one will be\none will be\none will be destination and after this I can also\ndestination and after this I can also\ndestination and after this I can also pass the stroke color so that the stroke\npass the stroke color so that the stroke\npass the stroke color so that the stroke is visible and I will pass stroke color\nis visible and I will pass stroke color\nis visible and I will pass stroke color as 0 0 0 and we can also pass the stroke\nas 0 0 0 and we can also pass the stroke\nas 0 0 0 and we can also pass the stroke width which will be I think two will be\nwidth which will be I think two will be\nwidth which will be I think two will be enough I will save this you can see the\nenough I will save this you can see the\nenough I will save this you can see the stroke is visible there is a path\nstroke is visible there is a path\nstroke is visible there is a path between both these two Lin now the next\nbetween both these two Lin now the next\nbetween both these two Lin now the next step will be to show the latitude and\nstep will be to show the latitude and\nstep will be to show the latitude and longitude on click of this show\nlongitude on click of this show\nlongitude on click of this show coordinate also to calculate the\ncoordinate also to calculate the\ncoordinate also to calculate the distance between them for that we will\ndistance between them for that we will\ndistance between them for that we will have to install on package name as gool\nhave to install on package name as gool\nhave to install on package name as gool so I will go to my CMD write a command\nso I will go to my CMD write a command\nso I will go to my CMD write a command here npmi gool lib let's install it\nhere npmi gool lib let's install it\nhere npmi gool lib let's install it until it is installing I will come here\nuntil it is installing I will come here\nuntil it is installing I will come here and I will write on press and on press I\nand I will write on press and on press I\nand I will write on press and on press I will call one function which will be\nwill call one function which will be\nwill call one function which will be show coordinates we copy this we go up\nshow coordinates we copy this we go up\nshow coordinates we copy this we go up let's create that function I will write\nlet's create that function I will write\nlet's create that function I will write here cons show coordinates just\nhere cons show coordinates just\nhere cons show coordinates just console.log here which will be my source\nconsole.log here which will be my source\nconsole.log here which will be my source and my I will save this let's see\nand my I will save this let's see\nand my I will save this let's see whether the installation is finished or\nwhether the installation is finished or\nwhether the installation is finished or not yeah it is done let me just restart\nnot yeah it is done let me just restart\nnot yeah it is done let me just restart my application now I will click on this\nmy application now I will click on this\nmy application now I will click on this choose Source okay I will select that\nchoose Source okay I will select that\nchoose Source okay I will select that Source here and then I will choose the\nSource here and then I will choose the\nSource here and then I will choose the destination and my destination will be I\ndestination and my destination will be I\ndestination and my destination will be I just zoom here and this will be my\njust zoom here and this will be my\njust zoom here and this will be my destination now I click on this show\ndestination now I click on this show\ndestination now I click on this show coordinates uh uh nothing is coming here\ncoordinates uh uh nothing is coming here\ncoordinates uh uh nothing is coming here why okay I have just control. log here\nwhy okay I have just control. log here\nwhy okay I have just control. log here so let me see in console and yeah I'm\nso let me see in console and yeah I'm\nso let me see in console and yeah I'm getting the both latitude and longitude\ngetting the both latitude and longitude\ngetting the both latitude and longitude so this is totally working fine now\nso this is totally working fine now\nso this is totally working fine now let's calculate the distance between\nlet's calculate the distance between\nlet's calculate the distance between them for that I will come here and I\nthem for that I will come here and I\nthem for that I will come here and I will write get distance this get\nwill write get distance this get\nwill write get distance this get distance should be imported from Gob so\ndistance should be imported from Gob so\ndistance should be imported from Gob so you can see here it has been imported\nyou can see here it has been imported\nyou can see here it has been imported from gool lib okay so I will come and\nfrom gool lib okay so I will come and\nfrom gool lib okay so I will come and inside this get distance I will pass\ninside this get distance I will pass\ninside this get distance I will pass latitude and this my latitude will be\nlatitude and this my latitude will be\nlatitude and this my latitude will be from Source do latitude comma longitude\nfrom Source do latitude comma longitude\nfrom Source do latitude comma longitude and it will also be from source.\nand it will also be from source.\nand it will also be from source. longitude then I will also have to pass\nlongitude then I will also have to pass\nlongitude then I will also have to pass the destination thing so here also I\nthe destination thing so here also I\nthe destination thing so here also I will pass latitude and this latitude\nwill pass latitude and this latitude\nwill pass latitude and this latitude will be from destination. latitude this\nwill be from destination. latitude this\nwill be from destination. latitude this get distance is a method provided by G\nget distance is a method provided by G\nget distance is a method provided by G to calculate the distance between two\nto calculate the distance between two\nto calculate the distance between two location through latitude and longitude\nlocation through latitude and longitude\nlocation through latitude and longitude so I will pass here longitude and at\nso I will pass here longitude and at\nso I will pass here longitude and at last everything should be divided by th\nlast everything should be divided by th\nlast everything should be divided by th so that I will get the distance in\nso that I will get the distance in\nso that I will get the distance in kilometers so I will just write here\nkilometers so I will just write here\nkilometers so I will just write here con is equals to get distance and At\ncon is equals to get distance and At\ncon is equals to get distance and At Last I can just console.log\nLast I can just console.log\nLast I can just console.log distance okay I think everything is fine\ndistance okay I think everything is fine\ndistance okay I think everything is fine I will save this now when I click on\nI will save this now when I click on\nI will save this now when I click on this show coordinates and let's open the\nthis show coordinates and let's open the\nthis show coordinates and let's open the console you can see here I'm getting\nconsole you can see here I'm getting\nconsole you can see here I'm getting latitude and longitude and also I'm\nlatitude and longitude and also I'm\nlatitude and longitude and also I'm getting the distance between them so\ngetting the distance between them so\ngetting the distance between them so this is also done okay now let me show\nthis is also done okay now let me show\nthis is also done okay now let me show one more thing so for that I will come\none more thing so for that I will come\none more thing so for that I will come here and now let's try to make this\nhere and now let's try to make this\nhere and now let's try to make this marker as draggable that means currently\nmarker as draggable that means currently\nmarker as draggable that means currently it is here we cannot drag that like once\nit is here we cannot drag that like once\nit is here we cannot drag that like once you select in the map here you cannot\nyou select in the map here you cannot\nyou select in the map here you cannot edit that but if we make that draggable\nedit that but if we make that draggable\nedit that but if we make that draggable now then we can edit that so for that I\nnow then we can edit that so for that I\nnow then we can edit that so for that I will come to the source and I will write\nwill come to the source and I will write\nwill come to the source and I will write here draggable which is another props\nhere draggable which is another props\nhere draggable which is another props and I will just set it to Pro I will add\nand I will just set it to Pro I will add\nand I will just set it to Pro I will add this dragable to the destination also\nthis dragable to the destination also\nthis dragable to the destination also and after this I will reload my\nand after this I will reload my\nand after this I will reload my application I just reload it I will just\napplication I just reload it I will just\napplication I just reload it I will just choose the source here and then I will\nchoose the source here and then I will\nchoose the source here and then I will choose the destination to here and now\nchoose the destination to here and now\nchoose the destination to here and now to drag that what I will do I will just\nto drag that what I will do I will just\nto drag that what I will do I will just zoom here I will click on the source\nzoom here I will click on the source\nzoom here I will click on the source then I will hold them and you can see\nthen I will hold them and you can see\nthen I will hold them and you can see the source is draggable in the same way\nthe source is draggable in the same way\nthe source is draggable in the same way I can drag the destination so I click on\nI can drag the destination so I click on\nI can drag the destination so I click on that I will hold the destination and you\nthat I will hold the destination and you\nthat I will hold the destination and you can see it is dragging but one thing you\ncan see it is dragging but one thing you\ncan see it is dragging but one thing you can notice that my PO line is still\ncan notice that my PO line is still\ncan notice that my PO line is still there fix that what I will do I will\nthere fix that what I will do I will\nthere fix that what I will do I will come here and is one function which is\ncome here and is one function which is\ncome here and is one function which is on drag end that is when drag is\non drag end that is when drag is\non drag end that is when drag is complete I will just write here one\ncomplete I will just write here one\ncomplete I will just write here one function which will set the destination\nfunction which will set the destination\nfunction which will set the destination to the new coordinate like previously\nto the new coordinate like previously\nto the new coordinate like previously destination was there I moved the\ndestination was there I moved the\ndestination was there I moved the destination from here to there in this I\ndestination from here to there in this I\ndestination from here to there in this I can pass e do Native event do\ncan pass e do Native event do\ncan pass e do Native event do coordinates same thing I will do for\ncoordinates same thing I will do for\ncoordinates same thing I will do for source so I will copy this I will come\nsource so I will copy this I will come\nsource so I will copy this I will come here I will paste that here and and\nhere I will paste that here and and\nhere I will paste that here and and instead of set destination I will set\ninstead of set destination I will set\ninstead of set destination I will set Source I will save this I will reload my\nSource I will save this I will reload my\nSource I will save this I will reload my application I prefer to reload because\napplication I prefer to reload because\napplication I prefer to reload because sometime it works and or sometime it\nsometime it works and or sometime it\nsometime it works and or sometime it don't now I will choose the source so I\ndon't now I will choose the source so I\ndon't now I will choose the source so I will click here choose the destination I\nwill click here choose the destination I\nwill click here choose the destination I will click here now I will just drag to\nwill click here now I will just drag to\nwill click here now I will just drag to drag I will click here and the moment I\ndrag I will click here and the moment I\ndrag I will click here and the moment I just complete the drag you can see the\njust complete the drag you can see the\njust complete the drag you can see the poly line is also following like if I\npoly line is also following like if I\npoly line is also following like if I put my source here poly line is going\nput my source here poly line is going\nput my source here poly line is going there so this is also working fine now\nthere so this is also working fine now\nthere so this is also working fine now only thing remaining is that when my\nonly thing remaining is that when my\nonly thing remaining is that when my source and destination is selected we\nsource and destination is selected we\nsource and destination is selected we have to show here remove source and\nhave to show here remove source and\nhave to show here remove source and remove destination button for that I\nremove destination button for that I\nremove destination button for that I will come here and here I will add one\nwill come here and here I will add one\nwill come here

map in our app interface and in this google map we have\ninterface and in this google map we have\ninterface and in this google map we have several other components\nseveral other components\nseveral other components so first we have this search bar and\nso first we have this search bar and\nso first we have this search bar and then we have\nthen we have\nthen we have this section where we have different\nthis section where we have different\nthis section where we have different categories and we can scroll through\ncategories and we can scroll through\ncategories and we can scroll through those items and these items are button\nthose items and these items are button\nthose items and these items are button and at the center of our screen we have\nand at the center of our screen we have\nand at the center of our screen we have custom markers\ncustom markers\ncustom markers and at the bottom we have different item\nand at the bottom we have different item\nand at the bottom we have different item details\ndetails\ndetails and these item details are correlated\nand these item details are correlated\nand these item details are correlated with these map markers\nwith these map markers\nwith these map markers so as we scroll through different items\nso as we scroll through different items\nso as we scroll through different items our map\nour map\nour map is centered to that location and that\nis centered to that location and that\nis centered to that location and that marker\nmarker\nmarker is highlighted as you can see that this\nis highlighted as you can see that this\nis highlighted as you can see that this marker is little bit bigger\nmarker is little bit bigger\nmarker is little bit bigger than rest of the markers right so we can\nthan rest of the markers right so we can\nthan rest of the markers right so we can scroll through\nscroll through\nscroll through all the different items similar thing we\nall the different items similar thing we\nall the different items similar thing we can do in our\ncan do in our\ncan do in our android emulator as well we can scroll\nandroid emulator as well we can scroll\nandroid emulator as well we can scroll through different items\nright and also we can click on any item\nright and also we can click on any item and if we click on that map marker that\nand if we click on that map marker that\nand if we

thing we have this sidebar\nanother thing we have this sidebar\nanother thing we have this sidebar and from the sidebar if we choose dark\nand from the sidebar if we choose dark\nand from the sidebar if we choose dark theme\nthen we can see that our map is changed\nthen we can see that our map is changed to\nto\nto dark mode and in the dark mode we have\ndark mode and in the dark mode we have\ndark mode and in the dark mode we have all the facilities\nall the facilities\nall the facilities right so it's all working perfect for\nright so it's all working perfect for\nright so it's all
