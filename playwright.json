Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation.\n\nThe Playwright library can be used as a general purpose browser automation tool, providing a powerful set of APIs to automate web applications, for both sync and async Python.\n\nThis introduction describes the Playwright Pytest plugin, which is the recommended way to write end-to-end tests.\n\nYou will learn\n\nHow to install Playwright Pytest\nHow to run the example test\nInstalling Playwright Pytest�\n\nPlaywright recommends using the official Playwright Pytest plugin to write end-to-end tests. It provides context isolation, running it on multiple browser configurations out of the box.\n\nGet started by installing Playwright and running the example test to see it in action.\n\nPyPI\nAnaconda\n\nInstall the Pytest plugin:\n\npip install pytest-playwright\n\n\nInstall the required browsers:\n\nplaywright install\n\nAdd Example Test�\n\nCreate a file that follows the test_ prefix convention, such as test_example.py, inside the current working directory or in a sub-directory with the code below. Make sure your test name also follows the test_ prefix convention.\n\ntest_example.py\nimport re\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page, expect\n\ndef test_has_title(page: Page):\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n\n    # Expect a title \"to contain\" a substring.\n    expect(page).to_have_title(re.compile(\"Playwright\"))\n\ndef test_get_started_link(page: Page):\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n\n    # Click the get started link.\n    page.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Get started\").click()\n\n    # Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.\n    expect(page.get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Installation\")).to_be_visible()\n\nRunning the Example Test�\n\nBy default tests will be run on chromium. This can be configured via the CLI options. Tests are run in headless mode meaning no browser UI will open up when running the tests. Results of the tests and test logs will be shown in the terminal.\n\npytest\n\nUpdating Playwright�\n\nTo update Playwright to the latest version run the following command:\n\npip install pytest-playwright playwright -U\n\nSystem requirements�\nPython 3.8 or higher.\nWindows 11+, Windows Server 2019+ or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\nmacOS 14 Ventura, or later.\nDebian 12, Debian 13, Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04, on x86-64 and arm64 architecture.\nWhat's next�\nWrite tests using web first assertions, page fixtures and locators\nRun single test, multiple tests, headed mode\nGenerate tests with Codegen\nSee a trace of your tests\nNext\nWriting tests\nIntroduction\nInstalling Playwright Pytest\nAdd Example Test\nRunning the Example Test\nUpdating Playwright\nSystem requirements\nWhat's next\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

These design choices allow Playwright users to forget about flaky timeouts and racy checks in their tests altogether.\n\nYou will learn\n\nHow to write the first test\nHow to perform actions\nHow to use assertions\nHow tests run in isolation\nHow to use test hooks\nFirst test�\n\nTake a look at the following example to see how to write a test. Note how the file name follows the test_ prefix convention as well as each test name.\n\ntest_example.py\nimport re\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page, expect\n\ndef test_has_title(page: Page):\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n\n    # Expect a title \"to contain\" a substring.\n    expect(page).to_have_title(re.compile(\"Playwright\"))\n\ndef test_get_started_link(page: Page):\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n\n    # Click the get started link.\n    page.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Get started\").click()\n\n    # Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.\n    expect(page.get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Installation\")).to_be_visible()\n\nActions�\nNavigation�\n\nMost of the tests will start with navigating page to the URL. After that, test will be able to interact with the page elements.\n\npage.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n\n\nPlaywright will wait for page to reach the load state prior to moving forward. Learn more about the page.goto() options.\n\nInteractions�\n\nPerforming actions starts with locating the elements. Playwright uses Locators API for that. Locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment, learn more about the different types of locators available. Playwright will wait for the element to be actionable prior to performing the action, so there is no need to wait for it to become available.\n\n# Create a locator.\nget_started = page.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Get started\")\n\n# Click it.\nget_started.click()\n\n\nIn most cases, it'll be written in one line:\n\npage.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Get started\").click()\n\nBasic actions�\n\nThis is the list of the most popular Playwright actions. Note that there are many more, so make sure to check the Locator API section to learn more about them.\n\nAction\tDescription\nlocator.check()\tCheck the input checkbox\nlocator.click()\tClick the element\nlocator.uncheck()\tUncheck the input checkbox\nlocator.hover()\tHover mouse over the element\nlocator.fill()\tFill the form field, input text\nlocator.focus()\tFocus the element\nlocator.press()\tPress single key\nlocator.set_input_files()\tPick files to upload\nlocator.select_option()\tSelect option in the drop down\nAssertions�\n\nPlaywright includes assertions that will wait until the expected condition is met. Using these assertions allows making the tests non-flaky and resilient. For example, this code will wait until the page gets the title containing \"Playwright\":\n\nimport re\nfrom playwright.sync_api import expect\n\nexpect(page).to_have_title(re.compile(\"Playwright\"))\n\n\nHere is the list of the most popular async assertions. Note that there are many more to get familiar with:\n\nAssertion\tDescription\nexpect(locator).to_be_checked()\tCheckbox is checked\nexpect(locator).to_be_enabled()\tControl is enabled\nexpect(locator).to_be_visible()\tElement is visible\nexpect(locator).to_contain_text()\tElement contains text\nexpect(locator).to_have_attribute()\tElement has attribute\nexpect(locator).to_have_count()\tList of elements has given length\nexpect(locator).to_have_text()\tElement matches text\nexpect(locator).to_have_value()\tInput element has value\nexpect(page).to_have_title()\tPage has title\nexpect(page).to_have_url()\tPage has URL\nTest isolation�\n\nThe Playwright Pytest plugin is based on the concept of test fixtures such as the built in page fixture, which is passed into your test. Pages are isolated between tests due to the Browser Context, which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile, where every test gets a fresh environment, even when multiple tests run in a single Browser.\n\ntest_example.py\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page\n\ndef test_example_test(page: Page):\n  pass\n  # \"page\" belongs to an isolated BrowserContext, created for this specific test.\n\ndef test_another_test(page: Page):\n  pass\n  # \"page\" in this second test is completely isolated from the first test.\n\nUsing fixtures�\n\nYou can use various fixtures to execute code before or after your tests and to share objects between them. A function scoped fixture e.g. with autouse behaves like a beforeEach/afterEach. And a module scoped fixture with autouse behaves like a beforeAll/afterAll which runs before all and after all the tests.\n\ntest_example.py\nimport pytest\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page, expect\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"function\", autouse=True)\ndef before_each_after_each(page: Page):\n    \n    print(\"before the test runs\")\n\n    # Go to the starting url before each test.\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n    yield\n    \n    print(\"after the test runs\")\n\ndef test_main_navigation(page: Page):\n    # Assertions use the expect API.\n    expect(page).to_have_url(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n\nWhat's next�\nRun single test, multiple tests, headed mode\nGenerate tests with Codegen\nSee a trace of your tests\nRun tests on CI with GitHub Actions\nPrevious\nInstallation\nNext\nGenerating tests\nIntroduction\nFirst test\nActions\nNavigation\nInteractions\nBasic actions\nAssertions\nTest isolation\nUsing fixtures\nWhat's next\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Codegen opens a browser window for interaction and the Playwright Inspector for recording, copying, and managing your generated tests.\n\nYou will learn\n\nHow to record a test\nHow to generate locators\nRunning Codegen�\n\nUse the codegen command to run the test generator followed by the URL of the website you want to generate tests for. The URL is optional and can be added directly in the browser window if omitted.\n\nplaywright codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc\n\nRecording a test�\n\nRun codegen and perform actions in the browser. Playwright generates code for your interactions automatically. Codegen analyzes the rendered page and recommends the best locator, prioritizing role, text, and test id locators. When multiple elements match a locator, the generator improves it to uniquely identify the target element, reducing test failures and flakiness.\n\nWith the test generator you can record:\n\nActions like click or fill by interacting with the page\nAssertions by clicking a toolbar icon, then clicking a page element to assert against. You can choose:\n'assert visibility' to assert that an element is visible\n'assert text' to assert that an element contains specific text\n'assert value' to assert that an element has a specific value\n\n�\n\nWhen you finish interacting with the page, press the 'record' button to stop recording and use the 'copy' button to copy the generated code to your editor.\n\nUse the 'clear' button to clear the code and start recording again. Once finished, close the Playwright Inspector window or stop the terminal command.\n\nTo learn more about generating tests, check out our detailed guide on Codegen.\n\nGenerating locators�\n\nYou can generate locators with the test generator.\n\nPress the 'Record' button to stop recording and the 'Pick Locator' button will appear\nClick the 'Pick Locator' button and hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element\nClick the element you want to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the locator playground next to the Pick Locator button\nEdit the locator in the locator playground to fine-tune it and see the matching element highlighted in the browser window\nUse the copy button to copy the locator and paste it into your code\n�\n\nEmulation�\n\nYou can generate tests using emulation for specific viewports, devices, color schemes, geolocation, language, or timezone. The test generator can also preserve authenticated state.

Tests can be run on one browser or multiple browsers by using the --browser flag. By default, tests are run in a headless manner, meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal. If you prefer, you can run your tests in headed mode by using the --headed CLI argument.\n\nYou will learn\n\nHow to run tests from the command line\nHow to debug tests\nRunning tests�\nCommand Line�\n\nTo run your tests, use the pytest command. This will run your tests on the Chromium browser by default. Tests run in headless mode by default meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal.\n\npytest\n\nRun tests in headed mode�\n\nTo run your tests in headed mode, use the --headed flag. This will open up a browser window while running your tests and once finished the browser window will close.\n\npytest --headed\n\nRun tests on different browsers�\n\nTo specify which browser you would like to run your tests on, use the --browser flag followed by the name of the browser.\n\npytest --browser webkit\n\n\nTo specify multiple browsers to run your tests on, use the --browser flag multiple times followed by the name of each browser.\n\npytest --browser webkit --browser firefox\n\nRun specific tests�\n\nTo run a single test file, pass in the name of the test file that you want to run.\n\npytest test_login.py\n\n\nTo run a set of test files, pass in the names of the test files that you want to run.\n\npytest tests/test_todo_page.py tests/test_landing_page.py\n\n\nTo run a specific test, pass in the function name of the test you want to run.\n\npytest -k test_add_a_todo_item\n\nRun tests in parallel�\n\nTo run your tests in parallel, use the --numprocesses flag followed by the number of processes you would like to run your tests on. We recommend half of logical CPU cores.\n\npytest --numprocesses 2\n\n\n(This assumes pytest-xdist is installed. For more information see here.)\n\nFor more information, see Playwright Pytest usage or the Pytest documentation for general CLI usage.\n\nDebugging tests�\n\nSince Playwright runs in Python, you can debug it with your debugger of choice, e.g., with the Python extension in Visual Studio Code. Playwright comes with the Playwright Inspector which allows you to step through Playwright API calls, see their debug logs and explore locators.\n\nTo debug all tests, run the following command.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG=1 pytest -s\n\n\nTo debug one test file, run the command followed by the name of the test file that you want to debug.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG=1 pytest -s test_example.py\n\n\nTo debug a specific test, add -k followed by the name of the test that you want to debug.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG=1 pytest -s -k test_get_started_link\n\n\nThis command will open up a Browser window as well as the Playwright Inspector. You can use the step over button at the top of the inspector to step through your test. Or press the play button to run your test from start to finish. Once the test has finished, the browser window will close.\n\nWhile debugging you can use the Pick Locator button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element. You can also edit the locator and see it highlighting live on the Browser window. Use the Copy Locator button to copy the locator to your clipboard and then paste it into your test.\n\nCheck out our debugging guide to learn more about the Playwright Inspector as well as debugging with Browser Developer tools.\n\nWhat's next�\nGenerate tests with Codegen\nSee a trace of your tests\nRun your tests on CI with GitHub Actions\nPrevious\nGenerating tests\nNext\nTrace viewer\nIntroduction\nRunning tests\nCommand Line\nRun tests in headed mode\nRun tests on different browsers\nRun specific tests\nRun tests in parallel\nDebugging tests\nWhat's next\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

In this section we cover running tests on GitHub using GitHub Actions. If you would like to see how to configure other CI providers, check out our detailed doc on Continuous Integration.\n\nYou will learn�\nHow to set up GitHub Actions\nHow to view test logs\nHow to view the trace\nSetting up GitHub Actions�\n\nTo add a GitHub Actions file, first create .github/workflows folder and inside it add a playwright.yml file containing the example code below so that your tests run on each push and pull request for the main/master branch.\n\n.github/workflows/playwright.yml\nname: Playwright Tests\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main, master ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main, master ]\njobs:\n  test:\n    timeout-minutes: 60\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v5\n    - name: Set up Python\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v6\n      with:\n        python-version: '3.13'\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n    - name: Ensure browsers are installed\n      run: python -m playwright install --with-deps\n    - name: Run your tests\n      run: pytest --tracing=retain-on-failure\n    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4\n      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}\n      with:\n        name: playwright-traces\n        path: test-results/\n\n\nTo learn more about this, see \"Understanding GitHub Actions\".\n\nLooking at the list of steps in jobs.test.steps, you can see that the workflow performs these steps:\n\nClone your repository\nInstall language dependencies\nInstall project dependencies and build\nInstall Playwright Browsers\nRun tests\nCreate a Repo and Push to GitHub�\n\nOnce you have your GitHub Actions workflow setup, then all you need to do is Create a repo on GitHub or push your code to an existing repository. Follow the instructions on GitHub and don't forget to initialize a git repository using the git init command so you can add, commit, and push your code.\n\nOpening the Workflows�\n\nClick on the Actions tab to see the workflows. Here you see if your tests have passed or failed.\n\n�\n\nViewing Test Logs�\n\nClicking on the workflow run shows you all the actions that GitHub performed and clicking on Run Playwright tests shows the error messages, what was expected and what was received as well as the call log.\n\n�\n\nViewing the Trace�\n\ntrace.playwright.dev is a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. You can upload trace files using drag and drop.\n\nProperly handling Secrets�\n\nArtifacts like trace files or console logs contain information about your test execution. They can contain sensitive data like user credentials for a test user, access tokens to a staging backend, testing source code, or sometimes even your application source code. Treat these files just as carefully as you treat that sensitive data. If you upload reports and traces as part of your CI workflow, make sure that you only upload them to trusted artifact stores, or that you encrypt the files before upload. The same is true for sharing artifacts with team members: Use a trusted file share or encrypt the files before sharing.\n\nWhat's Next�\nLearn how to use Locators\nLearn how to perform Actions\nLearn how to write Assertions\nLearn more about the Trace Viewer\nLearn more ways of running tests on GitHub Actions\nLearn more about running tests on other CI providers\nPrevious\nTrace viewer\nNext\nPytest Plugin Reference\nIntroduction\nSetting up GitHub Actions\nCreate a Repo and Push to GitHub\nOpening the Workflows\nViewing Test Logs\nViewing the Trace\nProperly handling Secrets\nWhat's Next\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

To get started with it, refer to the getting started guide.\n\nUsage�\n\nTo run your tests, use Pytest CLI.\n\npytest --browser webkit --headed\n\n\nIf you want to add the CLI arguments automatically without specifying them, you can use the pytest.ini file:\n\n# content of pytest.ini\n[pytest]\n# Run firefox with UI\naddopts = --headed --browser firefox\n\nCLI arguments�\n\nNote that CLI arguments are only applied to the default browser, context and page fixtures. If you create a browser, a context or a page with the API call like browser.new_context(), the CLI arguments are not applied.\n\n--headed: Run tests in headed mode (default: headless).\n--browser: Run tests in a different browser chromium, firefox, or webkit. It can be specified multiple times (default: chromium).\n--browser-channel Browser channel to be used.\n--slowmo Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on (default: 0).\n--device Device to be emulated.\n--output Directory for artifacts produced by tests (default: test-results).\n--tracing Whether to record a trace for each test. on, off, or retain-on-failure (default: off).\n--video Whether to record video for each test. on, off, or retain-on-failure (default: off).\n--screenshot Whether to automatically capture a screenshot after each test. on, off, or only-on-failure (default: off).\n--full-page-screenshot Whether to take a full page screenshot on failure. By default, only the viewport is captured. Requires --screenshot to be enabled (default: off).\nFixtures�\n\nThis plugin configures Playwright-specific fixtures for pytest. To use these fixtures, use the fixture name as an argument to the test function.\n\ndef test_my_app_is_working(fixture_name):\n    pass\n    # Test using fixture_name\n    # ...\n\n\nFunction scope: These fixtures are created when requested in a test function and destroyed when the test ends.\n\ncontext: New browser context for a test.\npage: New browser page for a test.\nnew_context: Allows creating different browser contexts for a test. Useful for multi-user scenarios. Accepts the same parameters as browser.new_context().\n\nSession scope: These fixtures are created when requested in a test function and destroyed when all tests end.\n\nplaywright: Playwright instance.\nbrowser_type: BrowserType instance of the current browser.\nbrowser: Browser instance launched by Playwright.\nbrowser_name: Browser name as string.\nbrowser_channel: Browser channel as string.\nis_chromium, is_webkit, is_firefox: Booleans for the respective browser types.\n\nCustomizing fixture options: For browser and context fixtures, use the following fixtures to define custom launch options.\n\nbrowser_type_launch_args: Override launch arguments for browser_type.launch(). It should return a Dict.\nbrowser_context_args: Override the options for browser.new_context(). It should return a Dict.\nconnect_options: Connect to an existing browser via WebSocket endpoint. It should return a Dict with browser_type.connect() options.\n\nIts also possible to override the context options (browser.new_context()) for a single test by using the browser_context_args marker:\n\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.mark.browser_context_args(timezone_id=\"Europe/Berlin\", locale=\"en-GB\")\ndef test_browser_context_args(page):\n    assert page.evaluate(\"window.navigator.userAgent\") == \"Europe/Berlin\"\n    assert page.evaluate(\"window.navigator.languages\") == [\"de-DE\"]\n\nParallelism: Running Multiple Tests at Once�\n\nIf your tests are running on a machine with a lot of CPUs, you can speed up the overall execution time of your test suite by using pytest-xdist to run multiple tests at once:\n\n# install dependency\npip install pytest-xdist\n# use the --numprocesses flag\npytest --numprocesses auto\n\n\nDepending on the hardware and nature of your tests, you can set numprocesses to be anywhere from 2 to the number of CPUs on the machine. If set too high, you may notice unexpected behavior.\n\nSee Running Tests for general information on pytest options.\n\nExamples�\nConfigure typings for auto-completion�\ntest_my_application.py\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page\n\ndef test_visit_admin_dashboard(page: Page):\n    page.goto(\"/admin\")\n    # ...\n\n\nIf you're using VSCode with Pylance, these types can be inferred by enabling the python.testing.pytestEnabled setting so you don't need the type annotation.\n\nUsing multiple contexts�\n\nIn order to simulate multiple users, you can create multiple BrowserContext instances.\n\ntest_my_application.py\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page, BrowserContext\nfrom pytest_playwright.pytest_playwright import CreateContextCallback\n\ndef test_foo(page: Page, new_context: CreateContextCallback) -> None:\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n    context = new_context()\n    page2 = context.new_page()\n    # page and page2 are in different contexts\n\nSkip test by browser�\ntest_my_application.py\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.mark.skip_browser(\"firefox\")\ndef test_visit_example(page):\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n    # ...\n\nRun on a specific browser�\nconftest.py\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.mark.only_browser(\"chromium\")\ndef test_visit_example(page):\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n    # ...\n\nRun with a custom browser channel like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge�\npytest --browser-channel chrome\n\ntest_my_application.py\ndef test_example(page):\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n\nConfigure base-url�\n\nStart Pytest with the base-url argument. The pytest-base-url plugin is used for that which allows you to set the base url from the config, CLI arg or as a fixture.\n\npytest --base-url http://localhost:8080\n\ntest_my_application.py\ndef test_visit_example(page):\n    page.goto(\"/admin\")\n    # -> Will result in http://localhost:8080/admin\n\nIgnore HTTPS errors�\nconftest.py\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef browser_context_args(browser_context_args):\n    return {\n        **browser_context_args,\n        \"ignore_https_errors\": True\n    }\n\nUse custom viewport size�\nconftest.py\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef browser_context_args(browser_context_args):\n    return {\n        **browser_context_args,\n        \"viewport\": {\n            \"width\": 1920,\n            \"height\": 1080,\n        }\n    }\n\nDevice emulation / BrowserContext option overrides�\nconftest.py\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef browser_context_args(browser_context_args, playwright):\n    iphone_11 = playwright.devices['iPhone 11 Pro']\n    return {\n        **browser_context_args,\n        **iphone_11,\n    }\n\n\nOr via the CLI --device=\"iPhone 11 Pro\"\n\nConnect to remote browsers�\nconftest.py\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef connect_options():\n    return {\n        \"wsEndpoint\": \"ws://localhost:8080/ws\"\n    }\n\nUsing with unittest.TestCase�\n\nSee the following example for using it with unittest.TestCase. This has a limitation, that only a single browser can be specified and no matrix of multiple browsers gets generated when specifying multiple.\n\nimport pytest\nimport unittest\n\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page\n\n\nclass MyTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)\n    def setup(self, page: Page):\n        self.page = page\n\n    def test_foobar(self):\n        self.page.goto(\"https://microsoft.com\")\n        self.page.locator(\"#foobar\").click()\n        assert self.page.evaluate(\"1 + 1\") == 2\n\nDebugging�\nUse with pdb�\n\nUse the breakpoint() statement in your test code to pause execution and get a pdb REPL.\n\ndef test_bing_is_working(page):\n    page.goto(\"https://bing.com\")\n    breakpoint()\n    # ...\n\nDeploy to CI�\n\nSee the guides for CI providers to deploy your tests to CI/CD.\n\nAsync Fixtures�\n\nTo use async fixtures, install pytest-playwright-asyncio.\n\nEnsure you are using pytest-asyncio>=0.26.0 and set asyncio_default_test_loop_scope = session in your configuration (pytest.ini/pyproject.toml/setup.cfg).\n\nimport pytest\nfrom playwright.async_api import Page\n\n@pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope=\"session\")\nasync def test_foo(page: Page):\n    await page.goto(\"https://github.com\")\n    # ...\n\nPrevious\nSetting up CI\nNext\nGetting started - Library\nIntroduction\nUsage\nCLI arguments\nFixtures\nParallelism: Running Multiple Tests at Once\nExamples\nConfigure typings for auto-completion\nUsing multiple contexts\nSkip test by browser\nRun on a specific browser\nRun with a custom browser channel like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge\nConfigure base-url\nIgnore HTTPS errors\nUse custom viewport size\nDevice emulation / BrowserContext option overrides\nConnect to remote browsers\nUsing with unittest.TestCase\nDebugging\nUse with pdb\nDeploy to CI\nAsync Fixtures\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

To modify this behavior see installation parameters.\n\nUsage�\n\nOnce installed, you can import Playwright in a Python script, and launch any of the 3 browsers (chromium, firefox and webkit).\n\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev\")\n    print(page.title())\n    browser.close()\n\n\nPlaywright supports two variations of the API: synchronous and asynchronous. If your modern project uses asyncio, you should use async API:\n\nimport asyncio\nfrom playwright.async_api import async_playwright\n\nasync def main():\n    async with async_playwright() as p:\n        browser = await p.chromium.launch()\n        page = await browser.new_page()\n        await page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev\")\n        print(await page.title())\n        await browser.close()\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n\nFirst script�\n\nIn our first script, we will navigate to https://playwright.dev/ and take a screenshot in WebKit.\n\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.webkit.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n    page.screenshot(path=\"example.png\")\n    browser.close()\n\n\nBy default, Playwright runs the browsers in headless mode. To see the browser UI, set headless option to False. You can also use slow_mo to slow down execution. Learn more in the debugging tools section.\n\nfirefox.launch(headless=False, slow_mo=50)\n\nInteractive mode (REPL)�\n\nYou can launch the interactive python REPL:\n\npython\n\n\nand then launch Playwright within it for quick experimentation:\n\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\nplaywright = sync_playwright().start()\n# Use playwright.chromium, playwright.firefox or playwright.webkit\n# Pass headless=False to launch() to see the browser UI\nbrowser = playwright.chromium.launch()\npage = browser.new_page()\npage.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\npage.screenshot(path=\"example.png\")\nbrowser.close()\nplaywright.stop()\n\n\nAsync REPL such as asyncio REPL:\n\npython -m asyncio\n\nfrom playwright.async_api import async_playwright\nplaywright = await async_playwright().start()\nbrowser = await playwright.chromium.launch()\npage = await browser.new_page()\nawait page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\nawait page.screenshot(path=\"example.png\")\nawait browser.close()\nawait playwright.stop()\n\nPyinstaller�\n\nYou can use Playwright with Pyinstaller to create standalone executables.\n\nmain.py\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\n    page.screenshot(path=\"example.png\")\n    browser.close()\n\n\nIf you want to bundle browsers with the executables:\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 playwright install chromium\npyinstaller -F main.py\n\nNOTE\n\nBundling the browsers with the executables will generate bigger binaries. It is recommended to only bundle the browsers you use.\n\nKnown issues�\ntime.sleep() leads to outdated state�\n\nMost likely you don't need to wait manually, since Playwright has auto-waiting. If you still rely on it, you should use page.wait_for_timeout(5000) instead of time.sleep(5) and it is better to not wait for a timeout at all, but sometimes it is useful for debugging. In these cases, use our wait (wait_for_timeout) method instead of the time module. This is because we internally rely on asynchronous operations and when using time.sleep(5) they can't get processed correctly.\n\nincompatible with SelectorEventLoop of asyncio on Windows�\n\nPlaywright runs the driver in a subprocess, so it requires ProactorEventLoop of asyncio on Windows because SelectorEventLoop does not supports async subprocesses.\n\nOn Windows Python 3.7, Playwright sets the default event loop to ProactorEventLoop as it is default on Python 3.8+.\n\nThreading�\n\nPlaywright's API is not thread-safe. If you are using Playwright in a multi-threaded environment, you should create a playwright instance per thread. See threading issue for more details.\n\nPrevious\nPytest Plugin Reference\nNext\nRelease notes\nInstallation\nPip\nConda\nUsage\nFirst script\nInteractive mode (REPL)\nPyinstaller\nKnown issues\ntime.sleep() leads to outdated state\nincompatible with SelectorEventLoop of asyncio on Windows\nThreading\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Both headed and headless browsers are subject to this. Your tests should still be passing after upgrading to Playwright 1.57.\n\nWe're expecting no functional changes to come from this switch. The biggest change is the new icon and title in your toolbar.\n\nIf you still see an unexpected behaviour change, please file an issue.\n\nOn Arm64 Linux, Playwright continues to use Chromium.\n\nBreaking Change�\n\nAfter 3 years of being deprecated, we removed page.accessibility from our API. Please use other libraries such as Axe if you need to test page accessibility. See our Node.js guide for integration with Axe.\n\nNew APIs�\nworker.on(\"console\") event is emitted when JavaScript within the worker calls one of console API methods, e.g. console.log or console.dir. worker.expect_event() can be used to wait for it.\nlocator.description returns locator description previously set with locator.describe().\nNew option steps in locator.click() and locator.drag_to() that configures the number of mousemove events emitted while moving the mouse pointer to the target element.\nNetwork requests issued by Service Workers are now reported and can be routed through the BrowserContext, only in Chromium. You can opt out using the PLAYWRIGHT_DISABLE_SERVICE_WORKER_NETWORK environment variable.\nConsole messages from Service Workers are dispatched through worker.on(\"console\"). You can opt out of this using the PLAYWRIGHT_DISABLE_SERVICE_WORKER_CONSOLE environment variable.\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 143.0.7499.4\nMozilla Firefox 144.0.2\nWebKit 26.0\nVersion 1.56�\nNew APIs�\nNew methods page.console_messages() and page.page_errors() for retrieving the most recent console messages from the page\nNew method page.requests() for retrieving the most recent network requests from the page\nBreaking Changes�\nEvent browser_context.on(\"backgroundpage\") has been deprecated and will not be emitted. Method browser_context.background_pages will return an empty list\nMiscellaneous�\nAria snapshots render and compare input placeholder\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 141.0.7390.37\nMozilla Firefox 142.0.1\nWebKit 26.0\nVersion 1.55�\nCodegen�\nAutomatic to_be_visible() assertions: Codegen can now generate automatic to_be_visible() assertions for common UI interactions. This feature can be enabled in the Codegen settings UI.\nBreaking Changes�\n⚠️ Dropped support for Chromium extension manifest v2.\nMiscellaneous�\nAdded support for Debian 13 \"Trixie\".\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 140.0.7339.16\nMozilla Firefox 141.0\nWebKit 26.0\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 139\nMicrosoft Edge 139\nVersion 1.54�\nHighlights�\n\nNew cookie property partition_key in browser_context.cookies() and browser_context.add_cookies(). This property allows to save and restore partitioned cookies. See CHIPS MDN article for more information. Note that browsers have different support and defaults for cookie partitioning.\n\nNew option --user-data-dir in multiple commands. You can specify the same user data dir to reuse browsing state, like authentication, between sessions.\n\nplaywright codegen --user-data-dir=./user-data\n\n\nplaywright open does not open the test recorder anymore. Use playwright codegen instead.\n\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 139.0.7258.5\nMozilla Firefox 140.0.2\nWebKit 26.0\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 140\nMicrosoft Edge 140\nVersion 1.53�\nTrace Viewer and HTML Reporter Updates�\n\nNew Steps in Trace Viewer: \n\nNew method locator.describe() to describe a locator. Used for trace viewer.\n\nbutton = page.get_by_test_id(\"btn-sub\").describe(\"Subscribe button\")\nbutton.click()\n\n\npython -m playwright install --list will now list all installed browsers, versions and locations.\n\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 138.0.7204.4\nMozilla Firefox 139.0\nWebKit 18.5\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 137\nMicrosoft Edge 137\nVersion 1.52�\nHighlights�\n\nNew method expect(locator).to_contain_class() to ergonomically assert individual class names on the element.\n\n  expect(page.get_by_role('listitem', name='Ship v1.52')).to_contain_class('done')\n\n\nAria Snapshots got two new properties: /children for strict matching and /url for links.\n\nexpect(locator).to_match_aria_snapshot(\"\"\"\n  - list\n    - /children: equal\n    - listitem: Feature A\n    - listitem:\n      - link \"Feature B\":\n        - /url: \"https://playwright.dev\"\n\"\"\")\n\nMiscellaneous�\nNew option max_redirects in api_request.new_context() to control the maximum number of redirects.\nBreaking Changes�\nGlob URL patterns in methods like page.route() do not support ? and [] anymore. We recommend using regular expressions instead.\nMethod route.continue_() does not allow to override the Cookie header anymore. If a Cookie header is provided, it will be ignored, and the cookie will be loaded from the browser's cookie store. To set custom cookies, use browser_context.add_cookies().\nmacOS 13 is now deprecated and will no longer receive WebKit updates. Please upgrade to a more recent macOS version to continue benefiting from the latest WebKit improvements.\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 136.0.7103.25\nMozilla Firefox 137.0\nWebKit 18.4\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 135\nMicrosoft Edge 135\nVersion 1.51�\nHighlights�\n\nNew option indexed_db for browser_context.storage_state() allows to save and restore IndexedDB contents. Useful when your application uses IndexedDB API to store authentication tokens, like Firebase Authentication.\n\nHere is an example following the authentication guide:\n\n# Save storage state into the file. Make sure to include IndexedDB.\nstorage = await context.storage_state(path=\"state.json\", indexed_db=True)\n\n# Create a new context with the saved storage state.\ncontext = await browser.new_context(storage_state=\"state.json\")\n\n\nNew option visible for locator.filter() allows matching only visible elements.\n\n# Ignore invisible todo items.\ntodo_items = page.get_by_test_id(\"todo-item\").filter(visible=True)\n# Check there are exactly 3 visible ones.\nawait expect(todo_items).to_have_count(3)\n\n\nNew option contrast for methods page.emulate_media() and browser.new_context() allows to emulate the prefers-contrast media feature.\n\nNew option fail_on_status_code makes all fetch requests made through the APIRequestContext throw on response codes other than 2xx and 3xx.\n\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 134.0.6998.35\nMozilla Firefox 135.0\nWebKit 18.4\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 133\nMicrosoft Edge 133\nVersion 1.50�\nAsync Pytest Plugin�\nPlaywright's Pytest plugin now has support for Async Fixtures.\nMiscellaneous�\nAdded method expect(locator).to_have_accessible_error_message() to assert the Locator points to an element with a given aria errormessage.\nUI updates�\nNew button in Codegen for picking elements to produce aria snapshots.\nAdditional details (such as keys pressed) are now displayed alongside action API calls in traces.\nDisplay of canvas content in traces is error-prone. Display is now disabled by default, and can be enabled via the Display canvas content UI setting.\nCall and Network panels now display additional time information.\nBreaking�\nexpect(locator).to_be_editable() and locator.is_editable() now throw if the target element is not <input>, <select>, or a number of other editable elements.\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 133.0.6943.16\nMozilla Firefox 134.0\nWebKit 18.2\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 132\nMicrosoft Edge 132\nVersion 1.49�\nAria snapshots�\n\nNew assertion expect(locator).to_match_aria_snapshot() verifies page structure by comparing to an expected accessibility tree, represented as YAML.\n\npage.goto(\"https://playwright.dev\")\nexpect(page.locator('body')).to_match_aria_snapshot('''\n  - banner:\n    - heading /Playwright enables reliable/ [level=1]\n    - link \"Get started\"\n    - link \"Star microsoft/playwright on GitHub\"\n  - main:\n    - img \"Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)\"\n    - heading \"Any browser • Any platform • One API\"\n''')\n\n\nYou can generate this assertion with Test Generator or by calling locator.aria_snapshot().\n\nLearn more in the aria snapshots guide.\n\nTracing groups�\n\nNew method tracing.group() allows you to visually group actions in the trace viewer.\n\n# All actions between group and group_end\n# will be shown in the trace viewer as a group.\npage.context.tracing.group(\"Open Playwright.dev > API\")\npage.goto(\"https://playwright.dev/\")\npage.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"API\").click()\npage.context.tracing.group_end()\n\nBreaking: chrome and msedge channels switch to new headless mode�\n\nThis change affects you if you're using one of the following channels in your playwright.config.ts:\n\nchrome, chrome-dev, chrome-beta, or chrome-canary\nmsedge, msedge-dev, msedge-beta, or msedge-canary\n\nAfter updating to Playwright v1.49, run your test suite. If it still passes, you're good to go. If not, you will probably need to update your snapshots, and adapt some of your test code around PDF viewers and extensions. See issue #33566 for more details.\n\nTry new Chromium headless�\n\nYou can opt into the new headless mode by using 'chromium' channel. As official Chrome documentation puts it:\n\nNew Headless on the other hand is the real Chrome browser, and is thus more authentic, reliable, and offers more features. This makes it more suitable for high-accuracy end-to-end web app testing or browser extension testing.\n\nSee issue #33566 for the list of possible breakages you could encounter and more details on Chromium headless.

Check them out on playwright.dev.\n\nVersion 1.23�\nNetwork Replay�\n\nNow you can record network traffic into a HAR file and re-use this traffic in your tests.\n\nTo record network into HAR file:\n\nnpx playwright open --save-har=github.har.zip https://github.com/microsoft\n\n\nAlternatively, you can record HAR programmatically:\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext = browser.new_context(record_har_path=\"github.har.zip\")\n# ... do stuff ...\ncontext.close()\n\n\nUse the new methods page.route_from_har() or browser_context.route_from_har() to serve matching responses from the HAR file:\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext.route_from_har(\"github.har.zip\")\n\n\nRead more in our documentation.\n\nAdvanced Routing�\n\nYou can now use route.fallback() to defer routing to other handlers.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Remove a header from all requests\ndef remove_header_handler(route: Route) -> None:\n    headers = route.request.all_headers()\n    if \"if-none-match\" in headers:\n        del headers[\"if-none-match\"]\n    route.fallback(headers=headers)\n\npage.route(\"**/*\", remove_header_handler)\n\n# Abort all images\ndef abort_images_handler(route: Route) -> None:\n    if route.request.resource_type == \"image\":\n        route.abort()\n    else:\n        route.fallback()\n\npage.route(\"**/*\", abort_images_handler)\n\n\nNote that the new methods page.route_from_har() and browser_context.route_from_har() also participate in routing and could be deferred to.\n\nWeb-First Assertions Update�\nNew method expect(locator).to_have_values() that asserts all selected values of <select multiple> element.\nMethods expect(locator).to_contain_text() and expect(locator).to_have_text() now accept ignore_case option.\nMiscellaneous�\n\nIf there's a service worker that's in your way, you can now easily disable it with a new context option service_workers:\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext = browser.new_context(service_workers=\"block\")\npage = context.new_page()\n\n\nUsing .zip path for recordHar context option automatically zips the resulting HAR:\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext = browser.new_context(record_har_path=\"github.har.zip\")\n\n\nIf you intend to edit HAR by hand, consider using the \"minimal\" HAR recording mode that only records information that is essential for replaying:\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext = browser.new_context(record_har_mode=\"minimal\", record_har_path=\"har.har\")\n\n\nPlaywright now runs on Ubuntu 22 amd64 and Ubuntu 22 arm64.\n\nVersion 1.22�\nHighlights�\n\nRole selectors that allow selecting elements by their ARIA role, ARIA attributes and accessible name.\n\n# Click a button with accessible name \"log in\"\npage.locator(\"role=button[name='log in']\").click()\n\n\nRead more in our documentation.\n\nNew locator.filter() API to filter an existing locator\n\nbuttons = page.locator(\"role=button\")\n# ...\nsubmit_button = buttons.filter(has_text=\"Submit\")\nsubmit_button.click()\n\n\nCodegen now supports generating Pytest Tests\n\nVersion 1.21�\nHighlights�\n\nNew role selectors that allow selecting elements by their ARIA role, ARIA attributes and accessible name.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Click a button with accessible name \"log in\"\npage.locator(\"role=button[name='log in']\").click()\n\n\nRead more in our documentation.\n\nNew scale option in page.screenshot() for smaller sized screenshots.\n\nNew caret option in page.screenshot() to control text caret. Defaults to \"hide\".\n\nBehavior Changes�\nThe mcr.microsoft.com/playwright docker image no longer contains Python. Please use mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python as a Playwright-ready docker image with pre-installed Python.\nPlaywright now supports large file uploads (100s of MBs) via locator.set_input_files() API.\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 101.0.4951.26\nMozilla Firefox 98.0.2\nWebKit 15.4\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 100\nMicrosoft Edge 100\nVersion 1.20�\nHighlights�\nNew options for methods page.screenshot(), locator.screenshot() and element_handle.screenshot():\nOption animations: \"disabled\" rewinds all CSS animations and transitions to a consistent state\nOption mask: Locator[] masks given elements, overlaying them with pink #FF00FF boxes.\nTrace Viewer now shows API testing requests.\nlocator.highlight() visually reveals element(s) for easier debugging.\nAnnouncements�\nWe now ship a designated Python docker image mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python. Please switch over to it if you use Python. This is the last release that includes Python inside our javascript mcr.microsoft.com/playwright docker image.\nv1.20 is the last release to receive WebKit update for macOS 10.15 Catalina. Please update macOS to keep using latest & greatest WebKit!\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 101.0.4921.0\nMozilla Firefox 97.0.1\nWebKit 15.4\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 99\nMicrosoft Edge 99\nVersion 1.19�\nHighlights�\n\nLocator now supports a has option that makes sure it contains another locator inside:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"article\", has=page.locator(\".highlight\")).click()\n\n\nRead more in locator documentation\n\nNew locator.page\n\npage.screenshot() and locator.screenshot() now automatically hide blinking caret\n\nPlaywright Codegen now generates locators and frame locators\n\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 100.0.4863.0\nMozilla Firefox 96.0.1\nWebKit 15.4\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 98\nMicrosoft Edge 98\nVersion 1.18�\nAPI Testing�\n\nPlaywright for Python 1.18 introduces new API Testing that lets you send requests to the server directly from Python! Now you can:\n\ntest your server API\nprepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test\nvalidate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser\n\nTo do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use new page.request API:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Do a GET request on behalf of page\nres = page.request.get(\"http://example.com/foo.json\")\n\n\nRead more in our documentation.\n\nWeb-First Assertions�\n\nPlaywright for Python 1.18 introduces Web-First Assertions.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page, expect\n\ndef test_status_becomes_submitted(page: Page) -> None:\n    # ..\n    page.locator(\"#submit-button\").click()\n    expect(page.locator(\".status\")).to_have_text(\"Submitted\")\n\n\nPlaywright will be re-testing the node with the selector .status until fetched Node has the \"Submitted\" text. It will be re-fetching the node and checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.\n\nRead more in our documentation.\n\nLocator Improvements�\n\nlocator.drag_to()\n\nEach locator can now be optionally filtered by the text it contains:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"li\", has_text=\"my item\").locator(\"button\").click()\n\n\nRead more in locator documentation\n\nNew APIs & changes�\naccept_downloads option now defaults to True.\nsources option to embed sources into traces.\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 99.0.4812.0\nMozilla Firefox 95.0\nWebKit 15.4\n\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 97\nMicrosoft Edge 97\nVersion 1.17�\nFrame Locators�\n\nPlaywright 1.17 introduces frame locators - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the iframe and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for iframe to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.\n\nFrame locators can be created with either page.frame_locator() or locator.frame_locator() method.\n\nlocator = page.frame_locator(\"my-frame\").locator(\"text=Submit\")\nlocator.click()\n\n\nRead more at our documentation.\n\nTrace Viewer Update�\n\nPlaywright Trace Viewer is now available online at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your trace.zip file to inspect its contents.\n\nNOTE: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; trace.playwright.dev is a progressive web application that processes traces locally.\n\nPlaywright Test traces now include sources by default (these could be turned off with tracing option)\nTrace Viewer now shows test name\nNew trace metadata tab with browser details\nSnapshots now have URL bar\n\nHTML Report Update�\nHTML report now supports dynamic filtering\nReport is now a single static HTML file that could be sent by e-mail or as a slack attachment.\n\nUbuntu ARM64 support + more�\n\nPlaywright now supports Ubuntu 20.04 ARM64. You can now run Playwright tests inside Docker on Apple M1 and on Raspberry Pi.\n\nYou can now use Playwright to install stable version of Edge on Linux:\n\nnpx playwright install msedge\n\nNew APIs�\nTracing now supports a 'title' option\nPage navigations support a new 'commit' waiting option\nVersion 1.16�\n🎭 Playwright Library�\nlocator.wait_for�\n\nWait for a locator to resolve to a single element with a given state. Defaults to the state: 'visible'.\n\nComes especially handy when working with lists:\n\norder_sent = page.locator(\"#order-sent\")\norder_sent.wait_for()\n\n\nRead more about locator.wait_for().\n\nDocker support for Arm64�\n\nPlaywright Docker image is now published for Arm64 so it can be used on Apple Silicon.\n\nRead more about Docker integration.\n\n🎭 Playwright Trace Viewer�\nrun trace viewer with npx playwright show-trace and drop trace files to the trace viewer PWA\nbetter visual attribution of action targets\n\nRead more about Trace Viewer.\n\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 97.0.4666.0\nMozilla Firefox 93.0\nWebKit 15.4\n\nThis version of Playwright was also tested against the following stable channels:\n\nGoogle Chrome 94\nMicrosoft Edge 94\nVersion 1.15�\n🖱️ Mouse Wheel�\n\nBy using mouse.wheel() you are now able to scroll vertically or horizontally.\n\n📜 New Headers API�\n\nPreviously it was not possible to get multiple header values of a response. This is now possible and additional helper functions are available:\n\nrequest.all_headers()\nrequest.headers_array()\nrequest.header_value()\nresponse.all_headers()\nresponse.headers_array()\nresponse.header_value()\nresponse.header_values()\n🌈 Forced-Colors emulation�\n\nIts now possible to emulate the forced-colors CSS media feature by passing it in the browser.new_context() or calling page.emulate_media().\n\nNew APIs�\npage.route() accepts new times option to specify how many times this route should be matched.\npage.set_checked() and locator.set_checked() were introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.\nrequest.sizes() Returns resource size information for given http request.\ntracing.start_chunk() - Start a new trace chunk.\ntracing.stop_chunk() - Stops a new trace chunk.\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 96.0.4641.0\nMozilla Firefox 92.0\nWebKit 15.0\nVersion 1.14�\n⚡️ New \"strict\" mode�\n\nSelector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. \"strict\" mode ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.\n\nPass strict=true into your action calls to opt in.\n\n# This will throw if you have more than one button!\npage.click(\"button\", strict=True)\n\n📍 New Locators API�\n\nLocator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.\n\nThe difference between the Locator and ElementHandle is that the latter points to a particular element, while Locator captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.\n\nAlso, locators are \"strict\" by default!\n\nlocator = page.locator(\"button\")\nlocator.click()\n\n\nLearn more in the documentation.\n\n🧩 Experimental React and Vue selector engines�\n\nReact and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to attribute selectors and supports all attribute selector operators.\n\npage.locator(\"_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]\").click()\npage.locator(\"_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]\").click()\n\n\nLearn more in the react selectors documentation and the vue selectors documentation.\n\n✨ New nth and visible selector engines�\nnth selector engine is equivalent to the :nth-match pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.\nvisible selector engine is equivalent to the :visible pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.\n# select the first button among all buttons\nbutton.click(\"button >> nth=0\")\n# or if you are using locators, you can use first, nth() and last\npage.locator(\"button\").first.click()\n\n# click a visible button\nbutton.click(\"button >> visible=true\")\n\nBrowser Versions�\nChromium 94.0.4595.0\nMozilla Firefox 91.0\nWebKit 15.0\nVersion 1.13�\nPlaywright�\n🖖 Programmatic drag-and-drop support via the page.drag_and_drop() API.\n🔎 Enhanced HAR with body sizes for requests and responses.

It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Text input\npage.get_by_role(\"textbox\").fill(\"Peter\")\n\n# Date input\npage.get_by_label(\"Birth date\").fill(\"2020-02-02\")\n\n# Time input\npage.get_by_label(\"Appointment time\").fill(\"13:15\")\n\n# Local datetime input\npage.get_by_label(\"Local time\").fill(\"2020-03-02T05:15\")\n\nCheckboxes and radio buttons�\n\nUsing locator.set_checked() is the easiest way to check and uncheck a checkbox or a radio button. This method can be used with input[type=checkbox], input[type=radio] and [role=checkbox] elements.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Check the checkbox\npage.get_by_label('I agree to the terms above').check()\n\n# Assert the checked state\nexpect(page.get_by_label('Subscribe to newsletter')).to_be_checked()\n\n# Select the radio button\npage.get_by_label('XL').check()\n\nSelect options�\n\nSelects one or multiple options in the <select> element with locator.select_option(). You can specify option value, or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Single selection matching the value or label\npage.get_by_label('Choose a color').select_option('blue')\n\n# Single selection matching the label\npage.get_by_label('Choose a color').select_option(label='Blue')\n\n# Multiple selected items\npage.get_by_label('Choose multiple colors').select_option(['red', 'green', 'blue'])\n\nMouse click�\n\nPerforms a simple human click.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Generic click\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").click()\n\n# Double click\npage.get_by_text(\"Item\").dblclick()\n\n# Right click\npage.get_by_text(\"Item\").click(button=\"right\")\n\n# Shift + click\npage.get_by_text(\"Item\").click(modifiers=[\"Shift\"])\n\n# Hover over element\npage.get_by_text(\"Item\").hover()\n\n# Click the top left corner\npage.get_by_text(\"Item\").click(position={ \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0})\n\n\nUnder the hood, this and other pointer-related methods:\n\nwait for element with given selector to be in DOM\nwait for it to become displayed, i.e. not empty, no display:none, no visibility:hidden\nwait for it to stop moving, for example, until css transition finishes\nscroll the element into view\nwait for it to receive pointer events at the action point, for example, waits until element becomes non-obscured by other elements\nretry if the element is detached during any of the above checks\nForcing the click�\n\nSometimes, apps use non-trivial logic where hovering the element overlays it with another element that intercepts the click. This behavior is indistinguishable from a bug where element gets covered and the click is dispatched elsewhere. If you know this is taking place, you can bypass the actionability checks and force the click:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").click(force=True)\n\nProgrammatic click�\n\nIf you are not interested in testing your app under the real conditions and want to simulate the click by any means possible, you can trigger the HTMLElement.click() behavior via simply dispatching a click event on the element with locator.dispatch_event():\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").dispatch_event('click')\n\nType characters�\nCAUTION\n\nMost of the time, you should input text with locator.fill(). See the Text input section above. You only need to type characters if there is special keyboard handling on the page.\n\nType into the field character by character, as if it was a user with a real keyboard with locator.press_sequentially().\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Press keys one by one\npage.locator('#area').press_sequentially('Hello World!')\n\n\nThis method will emit all the necessary keyboard events, with all the keydown, keyup, keypress events in place. You can even specify the optional delay between the key presses to simulate real user behavior.\n\nKeys and shortcuts�\nSync\nAsync\n# Hit Enter\npage.get_by_text(\"Submit\").press(\"Enter\")\n\n# Dispatch Control+Right\npage.get_by_role(\"textbox\").press(\"Control+ArrowRight\")\n\n# Press $ sign on keyboard\npage.get_by_role(\"textbox\").press(\"$\")\n\n\nThe locator.press() method focuses the selected element and produces a single keystroke. It accepts the logical key names that are emitted in the keyboardEvent.key property of the keyboard events:\n\nBackquote, Minus, Equal, Backslash, Backspace, Tab, Delete, Escape,\nArrowDown, End, Enter, Home, Insert, PageDown, PageUp, ArrowRight,\nArrowUp, F1 - F12, Digit0 - Digit9, KeyA - KeyZ, etc.\n\nYou can alternatively specify a single character you'd like to produce such as \"a\" or \"#\".\nFollowing modification shortcuts are also supported: Shift, Control, Alt, Meta.\n\nSimple version produces a single character. This character is case-sensitive, so \"a\" and \"A\" will produce different results.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# <input id=name>\npage.locator('#name').press('Shift+A')\n\n# <input id=name>\npage.locator('#name').press('Shift+ArrowLeft')\n\n\nShortcuts such as \"Control+o\" or \"Control+Shift+T\" are supported as well. When specified with the modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.\n\nNote that you still need to specify the capital A in Shift-A to produce the capital character. Shift-a produces a lower-case one as if you had the CapsLock toggled.\n\nUpload files�\n\nYou can select input files for upload using the locator.set_input_files() method. It expects first argument to point to an input element with the type \"file\". Multiple files can be passed in the array. If some of the file paths are relative, they are resolved relative to the current working directory. Empty array clears the selected files.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Select one file\npage.get_by_label(\"Upload file\").set_input_files('myfile.pdf')\n\n# Select multiple files\npage.get_by_label(\"Upload files\").set_input_files(['file1.txt', 'file2.txt'])\n\n# Select a directory\npage.get_by_label(\"Upload directory\").set_input_files('mydir')\n\n# Remove all the selected files\npage.get_by_label(\"Upload file\").set_input_files([])\n\n# Upload buffer from memory\npage.get_by_label(\"Upload file\").set_input_files(\n    files=[\n        {\"name\": \"test.txt\", \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\", \"buffer\": b\"this is a test\"}\n    ],\n)\n\n\nIf you don't have input element in hand (it is created dynamically), you can handle the page.on(\"filechooser\") event or use a corresponding waiting method upon your action:\n\nSync\nAsync\nwith page.expect_file_chooser() as fc_info:\n    page.get_by_label(\"Upload file\").click()\nfile_chooser = fc_info.value\nfile_chooser.set_files(\"myfile.pdf\")\n\nFocus element�\n\nFor the dynamic pages that handle focus events, you can focus the given element with locator.focus().\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_label('password').focus()\n\nDrag and Drop�\n\nYou can perform drag&drop operation with locator.drag_to(). This method will:\n\nHover the element that will be dragged.\nPress left mouse button.\nMove mouse to the element that will receive the drop.\nRelease left mouse button.\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"#item-to-be-dragged\").drag_to(page.locator(\"#item-to-drop-at\"))\n\nDragging manually�\n\nIf you want precise control over the drag operation, use lower-level methods like locator.hover(), mouse.down(), mouse.move() and mouse.up().\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"#item-to-be-dragged\").hover()\npage.mouse.down()\npage.locator(\"#item-to-drop-at\").hover()\npage.mouse.up()\n\nNOTE\n\nIf your page relies on the dragover event being dispatched, you need at least two mouse moves to trigger it in all browsers. To reliably issue the second mouse move, repeat your mouse.move() or locator.hover() twice. The sequence of operations would be: hover the drag element, mouse down, hover the drop element, hover the drop element second time, mouse up.\n\nScrolling�\n\nMost of the time, Playwright will automatically scroll for you before doing any actions. Therefore, you do not need to scroll explicitly.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Scrolls automatically so that button is visible\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").click()\n\n\nHowever, in rare cases you might need to manually scroll. For example, you might want to force an \"infinite list\" to load more elements, or position the page for a specific screenshot. In such a case, the most reliable way is to find an element that you want to make visible at the bottom, and scroll it into view.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Scroll the footer into view, forcing an \"infinite list\" to load more content\npage.get_by_text(\"Footer text\").scroll_into_view_if_needed()\n\n\nIf you would like to control the scrolling more precisely, use mouse.wheel() or locator.evaluate():\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Position the mouse and scroll with the mouse wheel\npage.get_by_test_id(\"scrolling-container\").hover()\npage.mouse.wheel(0, 10)\n\n# Alternatively, programmatically scroll a specific element\npage.get_by_test_id(\"scrolling-container\").evaluate(\"e => e.scrollTop += 100\")\n\nPrevious\nRelease notes\nNext\nAuto-waiting\nIntroduction\nText input\nCheckboxes and radio buttons\nSelect options\nMouse click\nType characters\nKeys and shortcuts\nUpload files\nFocus element\nDrag and Drop\nDragging manually\nScrolling\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

It auto-waits for all the relevant checks to pass and only then performs the requested action. If the required checks do not pass within the given timeout, action fails with the TimeoutError.\n\nFor example, for locator.click(), Playwright will ensure that:\n\nlocator resolves to exactly one element\nelement is Visible\nelement is Stable, as in not animating or completed animation\nelement Receives Events, as in not obscured by other elements\nelement is Enabled\n\nHere is the complete list of actionability checks performed for each action:\n\nAction\tVisible\tStable\tReceives Events\tEnabled\tEditable\nlocator.check()\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t-\nlocator.click()\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t-\nlocator.dblclick()\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t-\nlocator.set_checked()\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t-\nlocator.tap()\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t-\nlocator.uncheck()\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t-\nlocator.hover()\tYes\tYes\tYes\t-\t-\nlocator.drag_to()\tYes\tYes\tYes\t-\t-\nlocator.screenshot()\tYes\tYes\t-\t-\t-\nlocator.fill()\tYes\t-\t-\tYes\tYes\nlocator.clear()\tYes\t-\t-\tYes\tYes\nlocator.select_option()\tYes\t-\t-\tYes\t-\nlocator.select_text()\tYes\t-\t-\t-\t-\nlocator.scroll_into_view_if_needed()\t-\tYes\t-\t-\t-\nlocator.blur()\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nlocator.dispatch_event()\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nlocator.focus()\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nlocator.press()\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nlocator.press_sequentially()\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nlocator.set_input_files()\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nForcing actions�\n\nSome actions like locator.click() support force option that disables non-essential actionability checks, for example passing truthy force to locator.click() method will not check that the target element actually receives click events.\n\nAssertions�\n\nPlaywright includes auto-retrying assertions that remove flakiness by waiting until the condition is met, similarly to auto-waiting before actions.\n\nAssertion\tDescription\nexpect(locator).to_be_attached()\tElement is attached\nexpect(locator).to_be_checked()\tCheckbox is checked\nexpect(locator).to_be_disabled()\tElement is disabled\nexpect(locator).to_be_editable()\tElement is editable\nexpect(locator).to_be_empty()\tContainer is empty\nexpect(locator).to_be_enabled()\tElement is enabled\nexpect(locator).to_be_focused()\tElement is focused\nexpect(locator).to_be_hidden()\tElement is not visible\nexpect(locator).to_be_in_viewport()\tElement intersects viewport\nexpect(locator).to_be_visible()\tElement is visible\nexpect(locator).to_contain_text()\tElement contains text\nexpect(locator).to_have_attribute()\tElement has a DOM attribute\nexpect(locator).to_have_class()\tElement has a class property\nexpect(locator).to_have_count()\tList has exact number of children\nexpect(locator).to_have_css()\tElement has CSS property\nexpect(locator).to_have_id()\tElement has an ID\nexpect(locator).to_have_js_property()\tElement has a JavaScript property\nexpect(locator).to_have_text()\tElement matches text\nexpect(locator).to_have_value()\tInput has a value\nexpect(locator).to_have_values()\tSelect has options selected\nexpect(page).to_have_title()\tPage has a title\nexpect(page).to_have_url()\tPage has a URL\nexpect(response).to_be_ok()\tResponse has an OK status\n\nLearn more in the assertions guide.\n\nVisible�\n\nElement is considered visible when it has non-empty bounding box and does not have visibility:hidden computed style.\n\nNote that according to this definition:\n\nElements of zero size are not considered visible.\nElements with display:none are not considered visible.\nElements with opacity:0 are considered visible.\nStable�\n\nElement is considered stable when it has maintained the same bounding box for at least two consecutive animation frames.\n\nEnabled�\n\nElement is considered enabled when it is not disabled.\n\nElement is disabled when:\n\nit is a <button>, <select>, <input>, <textarea>, <option> or <optgroup> with a [disabled] attribute;\nit is a <button>, <select>, <input>, <textarea>, <option> or <optgroup> that is a part of a <fieldset> with a [disabled] attribute;\nit is a descendant of an element with [aria-disabled=true] attribute.\nEditable�\n\nElement is considered editable when it is enabled and is not readonly.\n\nElement is readonly when:\n\nit is a <select>, <input> or <textarea> with a [readonly] attribute;\nit has an [aria-readonly=true] attribute and an aria role that supports it.\nReceives Events�\n\nElement is considered receiving pointer events when it is the hit target of the pointer event at the action point. For example, when clicking at the point (10;10), Playwright checks whether some other element (usually an overlay) will instead capture the click at (10;10).\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where Playwright will click Sign Up button regardless of when the locator.click() call was made:\n\npage is checking that user name is unique and Sign Up button is disabled;\nafter checking with the server, the disabled Sign Up button is replaced with another one that is now enabled.\nPrevious\nActions\nNext\nAPI testing\nIntroduction\nForcing actions\nAssertions\nVisible\nStable\nEnabled\nEditable\nReceives Events\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

A few examples where it may come in handy:\n\nTest your server API.\nPrepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test.\nValidate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser.\n\nAll of that could be achieved via APIRequestContext methods.\n\nThe following examples rely on the pytest-playwright package which add Playwright fixtures to the Pytest test-runner.\n\nWriting API Test�\n\nAPIRequestContext can send all kinds of HTTP(S) requests over network.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use Playwright to test issues creation via GitHub API. The test suite will do the following:\n\nCreate a new repository before running tests.\nCreate a few issues and validate server state.\nDelete the repository after running tests.\nConfigure�\n\nGitHub API requires authorization, so we'll configure the token once for all tests. While at it, we'll also set the baseURL to simplify the tests.\n\nimport os\nfrom typing import Generator\n\nimport pytest\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Playwright, APIRequestContext\n\nGITHUB_API_TOKEN = os.getenv(\"GITHUB_API_TOKEN\")\nassert GITHUB_API_TOKEN, \"GITHUB_API_TOKEN is not set\"\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef api_request_context(\n    playwright: Playwright,\n) -> Generator[APIRequestContext, None, None]:\n    headers = {\n        # We set this header per GitHub guidelines.\n        \"Accept\": \"application/vnd.github.v3+json\",\n        # Add authorization token to all requests.\n        # Assuming personal access token available in the environment.\n        \"Authorization\": f\"token {GITHUB_API_TOKEN}\",\n    }\n    request_context = playwright.request.new_context(\n        base_url=\"https://api.github.com\", extra_http_headers=headers\n    )\n    yield request_context\n    request_context.dispose()\n\n\nWrite tests�\n\nNow that we initialized request object we can add a few tests that will create new issues in the repository.\n\nimport os\nfrom typing import Generator\n\nimport pytest\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Playwright, APIRequestContext\n\nGITHUB_API_TOKEN = os.getenv(\"GITHUB_API_TOKEN\")\nassert GITHUB_API_TOKEN, \"GITHUB_API_TOKEN is not set\"\n\nGITHUB_USER = os.getenv(\"GITHUB_USER\")\nassert GITHUB_USER, \"GITHUB_USER is not set\"\n\nGITHUB_REPO = \"test\"\n\n# ...\n\ndef test_should_create_bug_report(api_request_context: APIRequestContext) -> None:\n    data = {\n        \"title\": \"[Bug] report 1\",\n        \"body\": \"Bug description\",\n    }\n    new_issue = api_request_context.post(f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\", data=data)\n    assert new_issue.ok\n\n    issues = api_request_context.get(f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\")\n    assert issues.ok\n    issues_response = issues.json()\n    issue = list(filter(lambda issue: issue[\"title\"] == \"[Bug] report 1\", issues_response))[0]\n    assert issue\n    assert issue[\"body\"] == \"Bug description\"\n\ndef test_should_create_feature_request(api_request_context: APIRequestContext) -> None:\n    data = {\n        \"title\": \"[Feature] request 1\",\n        \"body\": \"Feature description\",\n    }\n    new_issue = api_request_context.post(f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\", data=data)\n    assert new_issue.ok\n\n    issues = api_request_context.get(f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\")\n    assert issues.ok\n    issues_response = issues.json()\n    issue = list(filter(lambda issue: issue[\"title\"] == \"[Feature] request 1\", issues_response))[0]\n    assert issue\n    assert issue[\"body\"] == \"Feature description\"\n\nSetup and teardown�\n\nThese tests assume that repository exists. You probably want to create a new one before running tests and delete it afterwards. Use a session fixture for that. The part before yield is the before all and after is the after all.\n\n# ...\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\", autouse=True)\ndef create_test_repository(\n    api_request_context: APIRequestContext,\n) -> Generator[None, None, None]:\n    # Before all\n    new_repo = api_request_context.post(\"/user/repos\", data={\"name\": GITHUB_REPO})\n    assert new_repo.ok\n    yield\n    # After all\n    deleted_repo = api_request_context.delete(f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}\")\n    assert deleted_repo.ok\n\nComplete test example�\n\nHere is the complete example of an API test:\n\nfrom enum import auto\nimport os\nfrom typing import Generator\n\nimport pytest\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Playwright, Page, APIRequestContext, expect\n\nGITHUB_API_TOKEN = os.getenv(\"GITHUB_API_TOKEN\")\nassert GITHUB_API_TOKEN, \"GITHUB_API_TOKEN is not set\"\n\nGITHUB_USER = os.getenv(\"GITHUB_USER\")\nassert GITHUB_USER, \"GITHUB_USER is not set\"\n\nGITHUB_REPO = \"test\"\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef api_request_context(\n    playwright: Playwright,\n) -> Generator[APIRequestContext, None, None]:\n    headers = {\n        # We set this header per GitHub guidelines.\n        \"Accept\": \"application/vnd.github.v3+json\",\n        # Add authorization token to all requests.\n        # Assuming personal access token available in the environment.\n        \"Authorization\": f\"token {GITHUB_API_TOKEN}\",\n    }\n    request_context = playwright.request.new_context(\n        base_url=\"https://api.github.com\", extra_http_headers=headers\n    )\n    yield request_context\n    request_context.dispose()\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\", autouse=True)\ndef create_test_repository(\n    api_request_context: APIRequestContext,\n) -> Generator[None, None, None]:\n    # Before all\n    new_repo = api_request_context.post(\"/user/repos\", data={\"name\": GITHUB_REPO})\n    assert new_repo.ok\n    yield\n    # After all\n    deleted_repo = api_request_context.delete(f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}\")\n    assert deleted_repo.ok\n\n\ndef test_should_create_bug_report(api_request_context: APIRequestContext) -> None:\n    data = {\n        \"title\": \"[Bug] report 1\",\n        \"body\": \"Bug description\",\n    }\n    new_issue = api_request_context.post(\n        f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\", data=data\n    )\n    assert new_issue.ok\n\n    issues = api_request_context.get(f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\")\n    assert issues.ok\n    issues_response = issues.json()\n    issue = list(\n        filter(lambda issue: issue[\"title\"] == \"[Bug] report 1\", issues_response)\n    )[0]\n    assert issue\n    assert issue[\"body\"] == \"Bug description\"\n\n\ndef test_should_create_feature_request(api_request_context: APIRequestContext) -> None:\n    data = {\n        \"title\": \"[Feature] request 1\",\n        \"body\": \"Feature description\",\n    }\n    new_issue = api_request_context.post(\n        f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\", data=data\n    )\n    assert new_issue.ok\n\n    issues = api_request_context.get(f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\")\n    assert issues.ok\n    issues_response = issues.json()\n    issue = list(\n        filter(lambda issue: issue[\"title\"] == \"[Feature] request 1\", issues_response)\n    )[0]\n    assert issue\n    assert issue[\"body\"] == \"Feature description\"\n\nPrepare server state via API calls�\n\nThe following test creates a new issue via API and then navigates to the list of all issues in the project to check that it appears at the top of the list. The check is performed using LocatorAssertions.\n\ndef test_last_created_issue_should_be_first_in_the_list(api_request_context: APIRequestContext, page: Page) -> None:\n    def create_issue(title: str) -> None:\n        data = {\n            \"title\": title,\n            \"body\": \"Feature description\",\n        }\n        new_issue = api_request_context.post(\n            f\"/repos/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\", data=data\n        )\n        assert new_issue.ok\n    create_issue(\"[Feature] request 1\")\n    create_issue(\"[Feature] request 2\")\n    page.goto(f\"https://github.com/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\")\n    first_issue = page.locator(\"a[data-hovercard-type='issue']\").first\n    expect(first_issue).to_have_text(\"[Feature] request 2\")\n\nCheck the server state after running user actions�\n\nThe following test creates a new issue via user interface in the browser and then checks via API if it was created:\n\ndef test_last_created_issue_should_be_on_the_server(api_request_context: APIRequestContext, page: Page) -> None:\n    page.goto(f\"https://github.com/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues\")\n    page.locator(\"text=New issue\").click()\n    page.locator(\"[aria-label='Title']\").fill(\"Bug report 1\")\n    page.locator(\"[aria-label='Comment body']\").fill(\"Bug description\")\n    page.locator(\"text=Submit new issue\").click()\n    issue_id = page.url.split(\"/\")[-1]\n\n    new_issue = api_request_context.get(f\"https://github.com/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/issues/{issue_id}\")\n    assert new_issue.ok\n    assert new_issue.json()[\"title\"] == \"[Bug] report 1\"\n    assert new_issue.json()[\"body\"] == \"Bug description\"\n\nReuse authentication state�\n\nWeb apps use cookie-based or token-based authentication, where authenticated state is stored as cookies. Playwright provides api_request_context.storage_state() method that can be used to retrieve storage state from an authenticated context and then create new contexts with that state.\n\nStorage state is interchangeable between BrowserContext and APIRequestContext. You can use it to log in via API calls and then create a new context with cookies already there. The following code snippet retrieves state from an authenticated APIRequestContext and creates a new BrowserContext with that state.\n\nrequest_context = playwright.request.new_context(http_credentials={\"username\": \"test\", \"password\": \"test\"})\nrequest_context.get(\"https://api.example.com/login\")\n# Save storage state into a variable.\nstate = request_context.storage_state()\n\n# Create a new context with the saved storage state.\ncontext = browser.new_context(storage_state=state)\n\nPrevious\nAuto-waiting\nNext\nAssertions\nIntroduction\nWriting API Test\nConfigure\nWrite tests\nSetup and teardown\nComplete test example\nPrepare server state via API calls\nCheck the server state after running user actions\nReuse authentication state\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

This isolation model improves reproducibility and prevents cascading test failures. Tests can load existing authenticated state. This eliminates the need to authenticate in every test and speeds up test execution.\n\nCore concepts�\n\nRegardless of the authentication strategy you choose, you are likely to store authenticated browser state on the file system.\n\nWe recommend to create playwright/.auth directory and add it to your .gitignore. Your authentication routine will produce authenticated browser state and save it to a file in this playwright/.auth directory. Later on, tests will reuse this state and start already authenticated.\n\nDANGER\n\nThe browser state file may contain sensitive cookies and headers that could be used to impersonate you or your test account. We strongly discourage checking them into private or public repositories.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nmkdir -p playwright/.auth\necho $'\\nplaywright/.auth' >> .gitignore\n\nSigning in before each test�\n\nThe Playwright API can automate interaction with a login form.\n\nThe following example logs into GitHub. Once these steps are executed, the browser context will be authenticated.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage = context.new_page()\npage.goto('https://github.com/login')\n\n# Interact with login form\npage.get_by_label(\"Username or email address\").fill(\"username\")\npage.get_by_label(\"Password\").fill(\"password\")\npage.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Sign in\").click()\n# Continue with the test\n\n\nRedoing login for every test can slow down test execution. To mitigate that, reuse existing authentication state instead.\n\nReusing signed in state�\n\nPlaywright provides a way to reuse the signed-in state in the tests. That way you can log in only once and then skip the log in step for all of the tests.\n\nWeb apps use cookie-based or token-based authentication, where authenticated state is stored as cookies, in local storage or in IndexedDB. Playwright provides browser_context.storage_state() method that can be used to retrieve storage state from authenticated contexts and then create new contexts with prepopulated state.\n\nCookies, local storage and IndexedDB state can be used across different browsers. They depend on your application's authentication model which may require some combination of cookies, local storage or IndexedDB.\n\nThe following code snippet retrieves state from an authenticated context and creates a new context with that state.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Save storage state into the file.\nstorage = context.storage_state(path=\"state.json\")\n\n# Create a new context with the saved storage state.\ncontext = browser.new_context(storage_state=\"state.json\")\n\nAdvanced scenarios�\nSession storage�\n\nReusing authenticated state covers cookies, local storage and IndexedDB based authentication. Rarely, session storage is used for storing information associated with the signed-in state. Session storage is specific to a particular domain and is not persisted across page loads. Playwright does not provide API to persist session storage, but the following snippet can be used to save/load session storage.\n\nSync\nAsync\nimport os\n# Get session storage and store as env variable\nsession_storage = page.evaluate(\"() => JSON.stringify(sessionStorage)\")\nos.environ[\"SESSION_STORAGE\"] = session_storage\n\n# Set session storage in a new context\nsession_storage = os.environ[\"SESSION_STORAGE\"]\ncontext.add_init_script(\"\"\"(storage => {\n  if (window.location.hostname === 'example.com') {\n    const entries = JSON.parse(storage)\n    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(entries)) {\n      window.sessionStorage.setItem(key, value)\n    }\n  }\n})('\"\"\" + session_storage + \"')\")\n\nPrevious\nAssertions\nNext\nBrowsers\nIntroduction\nCore concepts\nSigning in before each test\nReusing signed in state\nAdvanced scenarios\nSession storage\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

You will need to use the Playwright CLI to install these browsers.\n\nWith every release, Playwright updates the versions of the browsers it supports, so that the latest Playwright would support the latest browsers at any moment. It means that every time you update Playwright, you might need to re-run the install CLI command.\n\nInstall browsers�\n\nPlaywright can install supported browsers. Running the command without arguments will install the default browsers.\n\nplaywright install\n\n\nYou can also install specific browsers by providing an argument:\n\nplaywright install webkit\n\n\nSee all supported browsers:\n\nplaywright install --help\n\nInstall system dependencies�\n\nSystem dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.\n\nplaywright install-deps\n\n\nYou can also install the dependencies for a single browser by passing it as an argument:\n\nplaywright install-deps chromium\n\n\nIt's also possible to combine install-deps with install so that the browsers and OS dependencies are installed with a single command.\n\nplaywright install --with-deps chromium\n\n\nSee system requirements for officially supported operating systems.\n\nConfigure Browsers�\n\nPlaywright can run tests on Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers as well as branded browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It can also run on emulated tablet and mobile devices. See the registry of device parameters for a complete list of selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices.\n\nRun tests on different browsers�\n\nRun tests on a specific browser:\n\npytest test_login.py --browser webkit\n\n\nRun tests on multiple browsers:\n\npytest test_login.py --browser webkit --browser firefox\n\n\nTest against mobile viewports:\n\npytest test_login.py --device=\"iPhone 13\"\n\n\nTest against branded browsers:\n\npytest test_login.py --browser-channel msedge\n\nChromium�\n\nFor Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, by default, Playwright uses open source Chromium builds. Since the Chromium project is ahead of the branded browsers, when the world is on Google Chrome N, Playwright already supports Chromium N+1 that will be released in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge a few weeks later.\n\nChromium: headless shell�\n\nPlaywright ships a regular Chromium build for headed operations and a separate chromium headless shell for headless mode.\n\nIf you are only running tests in headless shell (i.e. the channel option is not specified), for example on CI, you can avoid downloading the full Chromium browser by passing --only-shell during installation.\n\n# only running tests headlessly\nplaywright install --with-deps --only-shell\n\nChromium: new headless mode�\n\nYou can opt into the new headless mode by using 'chromium' channel. As official Chrome documentation puts it:\n\nNew Headless on the other hand is the real Chrome browser, and is thus more authentic, reliable, and offers more features. This makes it more suitable for high-accuracy end-to-end web app testing or browser extension testing.\n\nSee issue #33566 for details.\n\npytest test_login.py --browser-channel chromium\n\n\nWith the new headless mode, you can skip downloading the headless shell during browser installation by using the --no-shell option:\n\n# only running tests headlessly\nplaywright install --with-deps --no-shell\n\nGoogle Chrome & Microsoft Edge�\n\nWhile Playwright can download and use the recent Chromium build, it can operate against the branded Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers available on the machine (note that Playwright doesn't install them by default). In particular, the current Playwright version will support Stable and Beta channels of these browsers.\n\nAvailable channels are chrome, msedge, chrome-beta, msedge-beta, chrome-dev, msedge-dev, chrome-canary, msedge-canary.\n\nWARNING\n\nCertain Enterprise Browser Policies may impact Playwright's ability to launch and control Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Running in an environment with browser policies is outside of the Playwright project's scope.\n\nWARNING\n\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge have switched to a new headless mode implementation that is closer to a regular headed mode. This differs from chromium headless shell that is used in Playwright by default when running headless, so expect different behavior in some cases. See issue #33566 for details.\n\npytest test_login.py --browser-channel msedge\n\n\nAlternatively when using the library directly, you can specify the browser channel when launching the browser:\n\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    # Channel can be \"chrome\", \"msedge\", \"chrome-beta\", \"msedge-beta\" or \"msedge-dev\".\n    browser = p.chromium.launch(channel=\"msedge\")\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev\")\n    print(page.title())\n    browser.close()\n\nInstalling Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge�\n\nIf Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge is not available on your machine, you can install them using the Playwright command line tool:\n\nplaywright install msedge\n\nWARNING\n\nGoogle Chrome or Microsoft Edge installations will be installed at the default global location of your operating system overriding your current browser installation.\n\nRun with the --help option to see a full a list of browsers that can be installed.\n\nWhen to use Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge and when not to?�\nDefaults�\n\nUsing the default Playwright configuration with the latest Chromium is a good idea most of the time. Since Playwright is ahead of Stable channels for the browsers, it gives peace of mind that the upcoming Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge releases won't break your site. You catch breakage early and have a lot of time to fix it before the official Chrome update.\n\nRegression testing�\n\nHaving said that, testing policies often require regression testing to be performed against the current publicly available browsers. In this case, you can opt into one of the stable channels, \"chrome\" or \"msedge\".\n\nMedia codecs�\n\nAnother reason for testing using official binaries is to test functionality related to media codecs. Chromium does not have all the codecs that Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge are bundling due to various licensing considerations and agreements. If your site relies on this kind of codecs (which is rarely the case), you will also want to use the official channel.\n\nEnterprise policy�\n\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge respect enterprise policies, which include limitations to the capabilities, network proxy, mandatory extensions that stand in the way of testing. So if you are part of the organization that uses such policies, it is easiest to use bundled Chromium for your local testing, you can still opt into stable channels on the bots that are typically free of such restrictions.\n\nFirefox�\n\nPlaywright's Firefox version matches the recent Firefox Stable build. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Firefox since it relies on patches.\n\nNote that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows.\n\nWebKit�\n\nPlaywright's WebKit is derived from the latest WebKit main branch sources, often before these updates are incorporated into Apple Safari and other WebKit-based browsers. This gives a lot of lead time to react on the potential browser update issues. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Safari since it relies on patches. Instead, you can test using the most recent WebKit build.\n\nNote that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows. While running WebKit on Linux CI is usually the most affordable option, for the closest-to-Safari experience you should run WebKit on mac, for example if you do video playback.\n\nInstall behind a firewall or a proxy�\n\nBy default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.\n\nSometimes companies maintain an internal proxy that blocks direct access to the public resources. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download browsers via a proxy server.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\npip install playwright\nHTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 playwright install\n\n\nIf the requests of the proxy get intercepted with a custom untrusted certificate authority (CA) and it yields to Error: self signed certificate in certificate chain while downloading the browsers, you must set your custom root certificates via the NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS environment variable before installing the browsers:\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nexport NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=\"/path/to/cert.pem\"\n\n\nIf your network is slow to connect to Playwright browser archive, you can increase the connection timeout in milliseconds with PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT environment variable:\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\npip install playwright\nPLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=120000 playwright install\n\n\nIf you are installing dependencies and need to use a proxy on Linux, make sure to run the command as a root user. Otherwise, Playwright will attempt to become a root and will not pass environment variables like HTTPS_PROXY to the linux package manager.\n\nsudo HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 playwright install-deps\n\nDownload from artifact repository�\n\nBy default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.\n\nSometimes companies maintain an internal artifact repository to host browser binaries. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download from a custom location using the PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST env variable.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\npip install playwright\nPLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 playwright install\n\n\nIt is also possible to use a per-browser download hosts using PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST, PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST and PLAYWRIGHT_WEBKIT_DOWNLOAD_HOST env variables that take precedence over PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\npip install playwright\nPLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3 PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 playwright install\n\nUsing a pre-installed Node.js�\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\npip install playwright\nPLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH=\"/usr/local/bin/node\" playwright install\n\nManaging browser binaries�\n\nPlaywright downloads Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers into the OS-specific cache folders:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\ms-playwright on Windows\n~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright on macOS\n~/.cache/ms-playwright on Linux\n\nThese browsers will take a few hundred megabytes of disk space when installed:\n\ndu -hs ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/*\n281M  chromium-XXXXXX\n187M  firefox-XXXX\n180M  webkit-XXXX\n\n\nYou can override default behavior using environment variables. When installing Playwright, ask it to download browsers into a specific location:\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\npip install playwright\nPLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers python -m playwright install\n\n\nWhen running Playwright scripts, ask it to search for browsers in a shared location.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers python playwright_script.py\n\n\nPlaywright keeps track of packages that need those browsers and will garbage collect them as you update Playwright to the newer versions.\n\nNOTE\n\nDevelopers can opt-in in this mode via exporting PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers in their .bashrc.\n\nStale browser removal�\n\nPlaywright keeps track of the clients that use its browsers. When there are no more clients that require a particular version of the browser, that version is deleted from the system. That way you can safely use Playwright instances of different versions and at the same time, you don't waste disk space for the browsers that are no longer in use.\n\nTo opt-out from the unused browser removal, you can set the PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_GC=1 environment variable.\n\nList all installed browsers:�\n\nPrints list of browsers from all playwright installations on the machine.\n\nplaywright install --list\n\nUninstall browsers�\n\nThis will remove the browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit) of the current Playwright installation:\n\nplaywright uninstall\n\n\nTo remove browsers of other Playwright installations as well, pass --all flag:\n\nplaywright uninstall --all\n\nPrevious\nAuthentication\nNext\nChrome extensions\nIntroduction\nInstall browsers\nInstall system dependencies\nConfigure Browsers\nRun tests on different browsers\nChromium\nChromium: headless shell\nChromium: new headless mode\nGoogle Chrome & Microsoft Edge\nFirefox\nWebKit\nInstall behind a firewall or a proxy\nDownload from artifact repository\nUsing a pre-installed Node.js\nManaging browser binaries\nStale browser removal\nList all installed browsers:\nUninstall browsers\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Utilizing Clock functionality allows developers to manipulate and control time within tests, enabling the precise validation of features such as rendering time, timeouts, scheduled tasks without the delays and variability of real-time execution.\n\nThe Clock API provides the following methods to control time:\n\nsetFixedTime: Sets the fixed time for Date.now() and new Date().\ninstall: initializes the clock and allows you to:\npauseAt: Pauses the time at a specific time.\nfastForward: Fast forwards the time.\nrunFor: Runs the time for a specific duration.\nresume: Resumes the time.\nsetSystemTime: Sets the current system time.\n\nThe recommended approach is to use setFixedTime to set the time to a specific value. If that doesn't work for your use case, you can use install which allows you to pause time later on, fast forward it, tick it, etc. setSystemTime is only recommended for advanced use cases.\n\nNOTE\n\npage.clock overrides native global classes and functions related to time allowing them to be manually controlled:\n\nDate\nsetTimeout\nclearTimeout\nsetInterval\nclearInterval\nrequestAnimationFrame\ncancelAnimationFrame\nrequestIdleCallback\ncancelIdleCallback\nperformance\nEvent.timeStamp\nWARNING\n\nIf you call install at any point in your test, the call MUST occur before any other clock related calls (see note above for list). Calling these methods out of order will result in undefined behavior. For example, you cannot call setInterval, followed by install, then clearInterval, as install overrides the native definition of the clock functions.\n\nTest with predefined time�\n\nOften you only need to fake Date.now while keeping the timers going. That way the time flows naturally, but Date.now always returns a fixed value.\n\n<div id=\"current-time\" data-testid=\"current-time\"></div>\n<script>\n  const renderTime = () => {\n    document.getElementById('current-time').textContent =\n        new Date().toLocaleString();\n  };\n  setInterval(renderTime, 1000);\n</script>\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.clock.set_fixed_time(datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 2, 10, 0, 0))\npage.goto(\"http://localhost:3333\")\nexpect(page.get_by_test_id(\"current-time\")).to_have_text(\"2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM\")\npage.clock.set_fixed_time(datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 2, 10, 30, 0))\n# We know that the page has a timer that updates the time every second.\nexpect(page.get_by_test_id(\"current-time\")).to_have_text(\"2/2/2024, 10:30:00 AM\")\n\nConsistent time and timers�\n\nSometimes your timers depend on Date.now and are confused when the Date.now value does not change over time. In this case, you can install the clock and fast forward to the time of interest when testing.\n\n<div id=\"current-time\" data-testid=\"current-time\"></div>\n<script>\n  const renderTime = () => {\n    document.getElementById('current-time').textContent =\n        new Date().toLocaleString();\n  };\n  setInterval(renderTime, 1000);\n</script>\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Initialize clock with some time before the test time and let the page load\n# naturally. `Date.now` will progress as the timers fire.\npage.clock.install(time=datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0))\npage.goto(\"http://localhost:3333\")\n\n# Pretend that the user closed the laptop lid and opened it again at 10am.\n# Pause the time once reached that point.\npage.clock.pause_at(datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 2, 10, 0, 0))\n\n# Assert the page state.\nexpect(page.get_by_test_id(\"current-time\")).to_have_text(\"2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM\")\n\n# Close the laptop lid again and open it at 10:30am.\npage.clock.fast_forward(\"30:00\")\nexpect(page.get_by_test_id(\"current-time\")).to_have_text(\"2/2/2024, 10:30:00 AM\")\n\nTest inactivity monitoring�\n\nInactivity monitoring is a common feature in web applications that logs out users after a period of inactivity. Testing this feature can be tricky because you need to wait for a long time to see the effect. With the help of the clock, you can speed up time and test this feature quickly.\n\n<div id=\"remaining-time\" data-testid=\"remaining-time\"></div>\n<script>\n  const endTime = Date.now() + 5 * 60_000;\n  const renderTime = () => {\n    const diffInSeconds = Math.round((endTime - Date.now()) / 1000);\n    if (diffInSeconds <= 0) {\n      document.getElementById('remaining-time').textContent =\n        'You have been logged out due to inactivity.';\n    } else {\n      document.getElementById('remaining-time').textContent =\n        `You will be logged out in ${diffInSeconds} seconds.`;\n    }\n    setTimeout(renderTime, 1000);\n  };\n  renderTime();\n</script>\n<button type=\"button\">Interaction</button>\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Initial time does not matter for the test, so we can pick current time.\npage.clock.install()\npage.goto(\"http://localhost:3333\")\n# Interact with the page\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").click()\n\n# Fast forward time 5 minutes as if the user did not do anything.\n# Fast forward is like closing the laptop lid and opening it after 5 minutes.\n# All the timers due will fire once immediately, as in the real browser.\npage.clock.fast_forward(\"05:00\")\n\n# Check that the user was logged out automatically.\nexpect(page.get_by_text(\"You have been logged out due to inactivity.\")).to_be_visible()\n\nTick through time manually, firing all the timers consistently�\n\nIn rare cases, you may want to tick through time manually, firing all timers and animation frames in the process to achieve a fine-grained control over the passage of time.\n\n<div id=\"current-time\" data-testid=\"current-time\"></div>\n<script>\n  const renderTime = () => {\n    document.getElementById('current-time').textContent =\n        new Date().toLocaleString();\n  };\n  setInterval(renderTime, 1000);\n</script>\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Initialize clock with a specific time, let the page load naturally.\npage.clock.install(\n    time=datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.pst),\n)\npage.goto(\"http://localhost:3333\")\nlocator = page.get_by_test_id(\"current-time\")\n\n# Pause the time flow, stop the timers, you now have manual control\n# over the page time.\npage.clock.pause_at(datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 2, 10, 0, 0))\nexpect(locator).to_have_text(\"2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM\")\n\n# Tick through time manually, firing all timers in the process.\n# In this case, time will be updated in the screen 2 times.\npage.clock.run_for(2000)\nexpect(locator).to_have_text(\"2/2/2024, 10:00:02 AM\")\n\nRelated Videos�\nPrevious\nChrome extensions\nNext\nDebugging Tests\nIntroduction\nTest with predefined time\nConsistent time and timers\nTest inactivity monitoring\nTick through time manually, firing all the timers consistently\nRelated Videos\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Use custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.\n\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge removed the command-line flags needed to side-load extensions, so use Chromium that comes bundled with Playwright.\n\nThe snippet below retrieves the service worker of a Manifest v3 extension whose source is located in ./my-extension.\n\nNote the use of the chromium channel that allows to run extensions in headless mode. Alternatively, you can launch the browser in headed mode.\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright\n\npath_to_extension = \"./my-extension\"\nuser_data_dir = \"/tmp/test-user-data-dir\"\n\n\ndef run(playwright: Playwright):\n    context = playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(\n        user_data_dir,\n        channel=\"chromium\",\n        args=[\n            f\"--disable-extensions-except={path_to_extension}\",\n            f\"--load-extension={path_to_extension}\",\n        ],\n    )\n    if len(context.service_workers) == 0:\n        service_worker = context.wait_for_event('serviceworker')\n    else:\n        service_worker = context.service_workers[0]\n\n    # Test the service worker as you would any other worker.\n    context.close()\n\n\nwith sync_playwright() as playwright:\n    run(playwright)\n\nTesting�\n\nTo have the extension loaded when running tests you can use a test fixture to set the context. You can also dynamically retrieve the extension id and use it to load and test the popup page for example.\n\nNote the use of the chromium channel that allows to run extensions in headless mode. Alternatively, you can launch the browser in headed mode.\n\nFirst, add fixtures that will load the extension:\n\nconftest.py\nfrom typing import Generator\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Playwright, BrowserContext\nimport pytest\n\n\n@pytest.fixture()\ndef context(playwright: Playwright) -> Generator[BrowserContext, None, None]:\n    path_to_extension = Path(__file__).parent.joinpath(\"my-extension\")\n    context = playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(\n        \"\",\n        channel=\"chromium\",\n        args=[\n            f\"--disable-extensions-except={path_to_extension}\",\n            f\"--load-extension={path_to_extension}\",\n        ],\n    )\n    yield context\n    context.close()\n\n\n@pytest.fixture()\ndef extension_id(context) -> Generator[str, None, None]:\n    # for manifest v3:\n    service_worker = context.service_workers[0]\n    if not service_worker:\n        service_worker = context.wait_for_event(\"serviceworker\")\n\n    extension_id = service_worker.url.split(\"/\")[2]\n    yield extension_id\n\n\n\nThen use these fixtures in a test:\n\ntest_foo.py\nfrom playwright.sync_api import expect, Page\n\n\ndef test_example_test(page: Page) -> None:\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n    expect(page.locator(\"body\")).to_contain_text(\"Changed by my-extension\")\n\n\ndef test_popup_page(page: Page, extension_id: str) -> None:\n    page.goto(f\"chrome-extension://{extension_id}/popup.html\")\n    expect(page.locator(\"body\")).to_have_text(\"my-extension popup\")\n\nPrevious\nBrowsers\nNext\nClock\nIntroduction\nTesting\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

It allows you to step through your tests, live edit locators, pick locators and see actionability logs.\n\nRun in debug mode�\n\nSet the PWDEBUG environment variable to run your Playwright tests in debug mode. This configures Playwright for debugging and opens the inspector. Additional useful defaults are configured when PWDEBUG=1 is set:\n\nBrowsers launch in headed mode\nDefault timeout is set to 0 (= no timeout)\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG=1 pytest -s\n\nStepping through your tests�\n\nYou can play, pause or step through each action of your test using the toolbar at the top of the Inspector. You can see the current action highlighted in the test code, and matching elements highlighted in the browser window.\n\nRun a test from a specific breakpoint�\n\nTo speed up the debugging process you can add a page.pause() method to your test. This way you won't have to step through each action of your test to get to the point where you want to debug.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.pause()\n\n\nOnce you add a page.pause() call, run your tests in debug mode. Clicking the \"Resume\" button in the Inspector will run the test and only stop on the page.pause().\n\nLive editing locators�\n\nWhile running in debug mode you can live edit the locators. Next to the 'Pick Locator' button there is a field showing the locator that the test is paused on. You can edit this locator directly in the Pick Locator field, and matching elements will be highlighted in the browser window.\n\nPicking locators�\n\nWhile debugging, you might need to choose a more resilient locator. You can do this by clicking on the Pick Locator button and hovering over any element in the browser window. While hovering over an element you will see the code needed to locate this element highlighted below. Clicking an element in the browser will add the locator into the field where you can then either tweak it or copy it into your code.\n\nPlaywright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If Playwright finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.\n\nActionability logs�\n\nBy the time Playwright has paused on a click action, it has already performed actionability checks that can be found in the log. This can help you understand what happened during your test and what Playwright did or tried to do. The log tells you if the element was visible, enabled and stable, if the locator resolved to an element, scrolled into view, and so much more. If actionability can't be reached, it will show the action as pending.\n\nTrace Viewer�\n\nPlaywright Trace Viewer is a GUI tool that lets you explore recorded Playwright traces of your tests. You can go back and forward through each action on the left side, and visually see what was happening during the action. In the middle of the screen, you can see a DOM snapshot for the action. On the right side you can see action details, such as time, parameters, return value and log. You can also explore console messages, network requests and the source code.\n\nTo learn more about how to record traces and use the Trace Viewer, check out the Trace Viewer guide.\n\nBrowser Developer Tools�\n\nWhen running in Debug Mode with PWDEBUG=console, a playwright object is available in the Developer tools console. Developer tools can help you to:\n\nInspect the DOM tree and find element selectors\nSee console logs during execution (or learn how to read logs via API)\nCheck network activity and other developer tools features\n\nTo debug your tests using the browser developer tools, start by setting a breakpoint in your test to pause the execution using the page.pause() method.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.pause()\n\n\nOnce you have set a breakpoint in your test, you can then run your test with PWDEBUG=console.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG=console pytest -s\n\n\nOnce Playwright launches the browser window, you can open the developer tools. The playwright object will be available in the console panel.\n\nplaywright.$(selector)�\n\nQuery the Playwright selector, using the actual Playwright query engine, for example:\n\nplaywright.$('.auth-form >> text=Log in');\n\n<button>Log in</button>\n\nplaywright.$$(selector)�\n\nSame as playwright.$, but returns all matching elements.\n\nplaywright.$$('li >> text=John')\n\n[<li>, <li>, <li>, <li>]\n\nplaywright.inspect(selector)�\n\nReveal element in the Elements panel.\n\nplaywright.inspect('text=Log in')\n\nplaywright.locator(selector)�\n\nCreate a locator and query matching elements, for example:\n\nplaywright.locator('.auth-form', { hasText: 'Log in' });\n\nLocator ()\n  - element: button\n  - elements: [button]\n\nplaywright.selector(element)�\n\nGenerates selector for the given element. For example, select an element in the Elements panel and pass $0:\n\nplaywright.selector($0)\n\n\"div[id=\"glow-ingress-block\"] >> text=/.*Hello.*/\"\n\nVerbose API logs�\n\nPlaywright supports verbose logging with the DEBUG environment variable.\n\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nDEBUG=pw:api pytest -s\n\nNOTE\n\nFor WebKit: launching WebKit Inspector during the execution will prevent the Playwright script from executing any further and will reset pre-configured user agent and device emulation.\n\nHeaded mode�\n\nPlaywright runs browsers in headless mode by default. To change this behavior, use headless: false as a launch option.\n\nYou can also use the slow_mo option to slow down execution (by N milliseconds per operation) and follow along while debugging.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit\nchromium.launch(headless=False, slow_mo=100)\n\nPrevious\nClock\nNext\nDialogs\nPlaywright Inspector\nRun in debug mode\nStepping through your tests\nRun a test from a specific breakpoint\nLive editing locators\nPicking locators\nActionability logs\nTrace Viewer\nBrowser Developer Tools\nVerbose API logs\nHeaded mode\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

For print dialogs, see Print.\n\nalert(), confirm(), prompt() dialogs�\n\nBy default, dialogs are auto-dismissed by Playwright, so you don't have to handle them. However, you can register a dialog handler before the action that triggers the dialog to either dialog.accept() or dialog.dismiss() it.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.on(\"dialog\", lambda dialog: dialog.accept())\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").click()\n\nNOTE\n\npage.on(\"dialog\") listener must handle the dialog. Otherwise your action will stall, be it locator.click() or something else. That's because dialogs in Web are modals and therefore block further page execution until they are handled.\n\nAs a result, the following snippet will never resolve:\n\nWARNING\n\nWRONG!\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.on(\"dialog\", lambda dialog: print(dialog.message))\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").click() # Will hang here\n\nNOTE\n\nIf there is no listener for page.on(\"dialog\"), all dialogs are automatically dismissed.\n\nbeforeunload dialog�\n\nWhen page.close() is invoked with the truthy run_before_unload value, the page runs its unload handlers. This is the only case when page.close() does not wait for the page to actually close, because it might be that the page stays open in the end of the operation.\n\nYou can register a dialog handler to handle the beforeunload dialog yourself:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef handle_dialog(dialog):\n    assert dialog.type == 'beforeunload'\n    dialog.dismiss()\n\npage.on('dialog', lambda: handle_dialog)\npage.close(run_before_unload=True)\n\nPrint dialogs�\n\nIn order to assert that a print dialog via window.print was triggered, you can use the following snippet:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.goto(\"<url>\")\n\npage.evaluate(\"(() => {window.waitForPrintDialog = new Promise(f => window.print = f);})()\")\npage.get_by_text(\"Print it!\").click()\n\npage.wait_for_function(\"window.waitForPrintDialog\")\n\n\nThis will wait for the print dialog to be opened after the button is clicked.

Simply configure the devices you would like to emulate and Playwright will simulate the browser behavior such as \"userAgent\", \"screenSize\", \"viewport\" and if it \"hasTouch\" enabled. You can also emulate the \"geolocation\", \"locale\" and \"timezone\" for all tests or for a specific test as well as set the \"permissions\" to show notifications or change the \"colorScheme\".\n\nDevices�\n\nPlaywright comes with a registry of device parameters using playwright.devices for selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices. It can be used to simulate browser behavior for a specific device such as user agent, screen size, viewport and if it has touch enabled.

Your page scripts run in the browser page environment. Those environments don't intersect, they are running in different virtual machines in different processes and even potentially on different computers.\n\nThe page.evaluate() API can run a JavaScript function in the context of the web page and bring results back to the Playwright environment. Browser globals like window and document can be used in evaluate.\n\nSync\nAsync\nhref = page.evaluate('() => document.location.href')\n\n\nIf the result is a Promise or if the function is asynchronous evaluate will automatically wait until it's resolved:\n\nSync\nAsync\nstatus = page.evaluate(\"\"\"async () => {\n  response = await fetch(location.href)\n  return response.status\n}\"\"\")\n\nDifferent environments�\n\nEvaluated scripts run in the browser environment, while your test runs in a testing environments. This means you cannot use variables from your test in the page and vice versa. Instead, you should pass them explicitly as an argument.\n\nThe following snippet is WRONG because it uses the variable directly:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndata = \"some data\"\nresult = page.evaluate(\"\"\"() => {\n  // WRONG: there is no \"data\" in the web page.\n  window.myApp.use(data)\n}\"\"\")\n\n\nThe following snippet is CORRECT because it passes the value explicitly as an argument:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndata = \"some data\"\n# Pass |data| as a parameter.\nresult = page.evaluate(\"\"\"data => {\n  window.myApp.use(data)\n}\"\"\", data)\n\nEvaluation Argument�\n\nPlaywright evaluation methods like page.evaluate() take a single optional argument. This argument can be a mix of Serializable values and JSHandle instances. Handles are automatically converted to the value they represent.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# A primitive value.\npage.evaluate('num => num', 42)\n\n# An array.\npage.evaluate('array => array.length', [1, 2, 3])\n\n# An object.\npage.evaluate('object => object.foo', { 'foo': 'bar' })\n\n# A single handle.\nbutton = page.evaluate_handle('window.button')\npage.evaluate('button => button.textContent', button)\n\n# Alternative notation using JSHandle.evaluate.\nbutton.evaluate('(button, from) => button.textContent.substring(from)', 5)\n\n# Object with multiple handles.\nbutton1 = page.evaluate_handle('window.button1')\nbutton2 = page.evaluate_handle('.button2')\npage.evaluate(\"\"\"o => o.button1.textContent + o.button2.textContent\"\"\",\n    { 'button1': button1, 'button2': button2 })\n\n# Object destructuring works. Note that property names must match\n# between the destructured object and the argument.\n# Also note the required parenthesis.\npage.evaluate(\"\"\"\n    ({ button1, button2 }) => button1.textContent + button2.textContent\"\"\",\n    { 'button1': button1, 'button2': button2 })\n\n# Array works as well. Arbitrary names can be used for destructuring.\n# Note the required parenthesis.\npage.evaluate(\"\"\"\n    ([b1, b2]) => b1.textContent + b2.textContent\"\"\",\n    [button1, button2])\n\n# Any mix of serializables and handles works.\npage.evaluate(\"\"\"\n    x => x.button1.textContent + x.list[0].textContent + String(x.foo)\"\"\",\n    { 'button1': button1, 'list': [button2], 'foo': None })\n\nInit scripts�\n\nSometimes it is convenient to evaluate something in the page before it starts loading. For example, you might want to setup some mocks or test data.\n\nIn this case, use page.add_init_script() or browser_context.add_init_script(). In the example below, we will replace Math.random() with a constant value.\n\nFirst, create a preload.js file that contains the mock.\n\n// preload.js\nMath.random = () => 42;\n\n\nNext, add init script to the page.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# In your test, assuming the \"preload.js\" file is in the \"mocks\" directory.\npage.add_init_script(path=\"mocks/preload.js\")\n\nPrevious\nEmulation\nNext\nEvents\nIntroduction\nDifferent environments\nEvaluation Argument\nInit scripts\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Below are some of the typical event awaiting patterns.\n\nWait for a request with the specified url using page.expect_request():\n\nSync\nAsync\nwith page.expect_request(\"**/*logo*.png\") as first:\n  page.goto(\"https://wikipedia.org\")\nprint(first.value.url)\n\n\nWait for popup window:\n\nSync\nAsync\nwith page.expect_popup() as popup:\n  page.get_by_text(\"open the popup\").click()\npopup.value.goto(\"https://wikipedia.org\")\n\nAdding/removing event listener�\n\nSometimes, events happen in random time and instead of waiting for them, they need to be handled. Playwright supports traditional language mechanisms for subscribing and unsubscribing from the events:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef print_request_sent(request):\n  print(\"Request sent: \" + request.url)\n\ndef print_request_finished(request):\n  print(\"Request finished: \" + request.url)\n\npage.on(\"request\", print_request_sent)\npage.on(\"requestfinished\", print_request_finished)\npage.goto(\"https://wikipedia.org\")\n\npage.remove_listener(\"requestfinished\", print_request_finished)\npage.goto(\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\")\n\nAdding one-off listeners�\n\nIf a certain event needs to be handled once, there is a convenience API for that:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.once(\"dialog\", lambda dialog: dialog.accept(\"2021\"))\npage.evaluate(\"prompt('Enter a number:')\")\n\nPrevious\nEvaluating JavaScript\nNext\nExtensibility\nIntroduction\nWaiting for event\nAdding/removing event listener\nAdding one-off listeners\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

To isolate the engine from any JavaScript in the frame, but leave access to the DOM, register the engine with {contentScript: true} option. Content script engine is safer because it is protected from any tampering with the global objects, for example altering Node.prototype methods. All built-in selector engines run as content scripts. Note that running as a content script is not guaranteed when the engine is used together with other custom engines.\n\nSelectors must be registered before creating the page.\n\nAn example of registering selector engine that queries elements based on a tag name:\n\nSync\nAsync\ntag_selector = \"\"\"\n    // Must evaluate to a selector engine instance.\n    {\n      // Returns the first element matching given selector in the root's subtree.\n      query(root, selector) {\n        return root.querySelector(selector);\n      },\n\n      // Returns all elements matching given selector in the root's subtree.\n      queryAll(root, selector) {\n        return Array.from(root.querySelectorAll(selector));\n      }\n    }\"\"\"\n\n# register the engine. selectors will be prefixed with \"tag=\".\nplaywright.selectors.register(\"tag\", tag_selector)\n\n# now we can use \"tag=\" selectors.\nbutton = page.locator(\"tag=button\")\nbutton.click()\n\n# we can combine it with built-in locators.\npage.locator(\"tag=div\").get_by_text(\"click me\").click()\n\n# we can use it in any methods supporting selectors.\nbutton_count = page.locator(\"tag=button\").count()\n\nPrevious\nEvents\nNext\nFrames\nCustom selector engines\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

These handles live in the Playwright process, whereas the actual objects live in the browser. There are two types of handles:\n\nJSHandle to reference any JavaScript objects in the page\nElementHandle to reference DOM elements in the page, it has extra methods that allow performing actions on the elements and asserting their properties.\n\nSince any DOM element in the page is also a JavaScript object, any ElementHandle is a JSHandle as well.\n\nHandles are used to perform operations on those actual objects in the page. You can evaluate on a handle, get handle properties, pass handle as an evaluation parameter, serialize page object into JSON etc. See the JSHandle class API for these and methods.\n\nAPI reference�\nJSHandle\nElementHandle\n\nHere is the easiest way to obtain a JSHandle.\n\nSync\nAsync\njs_handle = page.evaluate_handle('window')\n#  Use jsHandle for evaluations.\n\nElement Handles�\nDISCOURAGED\n\nThe use of ElementHandle is discouraged, use Locator objects and web-first assertions instead.\n\nWhen ElementHandle is required, it is recommended to fetch it with the page.wait_for_selector() or frame.wait_for_selector() methods. These APIs wait for the element to be attached and visible.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Get the element handle\nelement_handle = page.wait_for_selector('#box')\n\n# Assert bounding box for the element\nbounding_box = element_handle.bounding_box()\nassert bounding_box.width == 100\n\n# Assert attribute for the element\nclass_names = element_handle.get_attribute('class')\nassert 'highlighted' in class_names\n\nHandles as parameters�\n\nHandles can be passed into the page.evaluate() and similar methods. The following snippet creates a new array in the page, initializes it with data and returns a handle to this array into Playwright. It then uses the handle in subsequent evaluations:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Create new array in page.\nmy_array_handle = page.evaluate_handle(\"\"\"() => {\n  window.myArray = [1];\n  return myArray;\n}\"\"\")\n\n# Get current length of the array.\nlength = page.evaluate(\"a => a.length\", my_array_handle)\n\n# Add one more element to the array using the handle\npage.evaluate(\"(arg) => arg.myArray.push(arg.newElement)\", {\n  'myArray': my_array_handle,\n  'newElement': 2\n})\n\n# Release the object when it's no longer needed.\nmy_array_handle.dispose()\n\nHandle Lifecycle�\n\nHandles can be acquired using the page methods such as page.evaluate_handle(), page.query_selector() or page.query_selector_all() or their frame counterparts frame.evaluate_handle(), frame.query_selector() or frame.query_selector_all(). Once created, handles will retain object from garbage collection unless page navigates or the handle is manually disposed via the js_handle.dispose() method.\n\nAPI reference�\nJSHandle\nElementHandle\nelement_handle.bounding_box()\nelement_handle.get_attribute()\nelement_handle.inner_text()\nelement_handle.inner_html()\nelement_handle.text_content()\njs_handle.evaluate()\npage.evaluate_handle()\npage.query_selector()\npage.query_selector_all()\nLocator vs ElementHandle�\nCAUTION\n\nWe only recommend using ElementHandle in the rare cases when you need to perform extensive DOM traversal on a static page. For all user actions and assertions use locator instead.\n\nThe difference between the Locator and ElementHandle is that the latter points to a particular element, while Locator captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.\n\nIn the example below, handle points to a particular DOM element on page. If that element changes text or is used by React to render an entirely different component, handle is still pointing to that very stale DOM element. This can lead to unexpected behaviors.\n\nSync\nAsync\nhandle = page.query_selector(\"text=Submit\")\nhandle.hover()\nhandle.click()\n\n\nWith the locator, every time the locator is used, up-to-date DOM element is located in the page using the selector. So in the snippet below, underlying DOM element is going to be located twice.\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator = page.get_by_text(\"Submit\")\nlocator.hover()\nlocator.click()\n\nPrevious\nFrames\nNext\nIsolation\nIntroduction\nAPI reference\nElement Handles\nHandles as parameters\nHandle Lifecycle\nAPI reference\nLocator vs ElementHandle\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

This isolation model improves reproducibility and prevents cascading test failures.\n\nWhat is Test Isolation?�\n\nTest Isolation is when each test is completely isolated from another test. Every test runs independently from any other test. This means that each test has its own local storage, session storage, cookies etc. Playwright achieves this using BrowserContexts which are equivalent to incognito-like profiles. They are fast and cheap to create and are completely isolated, even when running in a single browser. Playwright creates a context for each test, and provides a default Page in that context.\n\nWhy is Test Isolation Important?�\nNo failure carry-over. If one test fails it doesn't affect the other test.\nEasy to debug errors or flakiness, because you can run just a single test as many times as you'd like.\nDon't have to think about the order when running in parallel, sharding, etc.\nTwo Ways of Test Isolation�\n\nThere are two different strategies when it comes to Test Isolation: start from scratch or cleanup in between. The problem with cleaning up in between tests is that it can be easy to forget to clean up and some things are impossible to clean up such as \"visited links\". State from one test can leak into the next test which could cause your test to fail and make debugging harder as the problem comes from another test. Starting from scratch means everything is new, so if the test fails you only have to look within that test to debug.\n\nHow Playwright Achieves Test Isolation�\n\nPlaywright uses browser contexts to achieve Test Isolation. Each test has its own Browser Context. Running the test creates a new browser context each time. When using Playwright as a Test Runner, browser contexts are created by default. Otherwise, you can create browser contexts manually.\n\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser = playwright.chromium.launch()\ncontext = browser.new_context()\npage = context.new_page()\n\n\nBrowser contexts can also be used to emulate multi-page scenarios involving mobile devices, permissions, locale and color scheme. Check out our Emulation guide for more details.\n\nMultiple Contexts in a Single Test�\n\nPlaywright can create multiple browser contexts within a single scenario. This is useful when you want to test for multi-user functionality, like a chat.\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright\n\ndef run(playwright: Playwright):\n    # create a chromium browser instance\n    chromium = playwright.chromium\n    browser = chromium.launch()\n\n    # create two isolated browser contexts\n    user_context = browser.new_context()\n    admin_context = browser.new_context()\n\n    # create pages and interact with contexts independently\n\nwith sync_playwright() as playwright:\n    run(playwright)\n\nPrevious\nHandles\nNext\nLocators\nIntroduction\nWhat is Test Isolation?\nWhy is Test Isolation Important?\nTwo Ways of Test Isolation\nHow Playwright Achieves Test Isolation\nMultiple Contexts in a Single Test\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Playwright provides APIs to mock and modify network traffic, both HTTP and HTTPS. Any requests that a page does, including XHRs and fetch requests, can be tracked, modified and mocked. With Playwright you can also mock using HAR files that contain multiple network requests made by the page.\n\nMock API requests�\n\nThe following code will intercept all the calls to */**/api/v1/fruits and will return a custom response instead. No requests to the API will be made. The test goes to the URL that uses the mocked route and asserts that mock data is present on the page.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef test_mock_the_fruit_api(page: Page):\n    def handle(route: Route):\n        json = [{\"name\": \"Strawberry\", \"id\": 21}]\n        # fulfill the route with the mock data\n        route.fulfill(json=json)\n\n    # Intercept the route to the fruit API\n    page.route(\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\", handle)\n\n    # Go to the page\n    page.goto(\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\")\n\n    # Assert that the Strawberry fruit is visible\n    expect(page.get_by_text(\"Strawberry\")).to_be_visible()\n\n\nYou can see from the trace of the example test that the API was never called, it was however fulfilled with the mock data. \n\nRead more about advanced networking.\n\nModify API responses�\n\nSometimes, it is essential to make an API request, but the response needs to be patched to allow for reproducible testing. In that case, instead of mocking the request, one can perform the request and fulfill it with the modified response.\n\nIn the example below we intercept the call to the fruit API and add a new fruit called 'Loquat', to the data. We then go to the url and assert that this data is there:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef test_gets_the_json_from_api_and_adds_a_new_fruit(page: Page):\n    def handle(route: Route):\n        response = route.fetch()\n        json = response.json()\n        json.append({ \"name\": \"Loquat\", \"id\": 100})\n        # Fulfill using the original response, while patching the response body\n        # with the given JSON object.\n        route.fulfill(response=response, json=json)\n\n    page.route(\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking/api/v1/fruits\", handle)\n\n    # Go to the page\n    page.goto(\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\")\n\n    # Assert that the new fruit is visible\n    expect(page.get_by_text(\"Loquat\", exact=True)).to_be_visible()\n\n\nIn the trace of our test we can see that the API was called and the response was modified. \n\nBy inspecting the response we can see that our new fruit was added to the list. \n\nRead more about advanced networking.\n\nMocking with HAR files�\n\nA HAR file is an HTTP Archive file that contains a record of all the network requests that are made when a page is loaded. It contains information about the request and response headers, cookies, content, timings, and more. You can use HAR files to mock network requests in your tests. You'll need to:\n\nRecord a HAR file.\nCommit the HAR file alongside the tests.\nRoute requests using the saved HAR files in the tests.\nRecording a HAR file�\n\nTo record a HAR file we use page.route_from_har() or browser_context.route_from_har() method. This method takes in the path to the HAR file and an optional object of options. The options object can contain the URL so that only requests with the URL matching the specified glob pattern will be served from the HAR File. If not specified, all requests will be served from the HAR file.\n\nSetting update option to true will create or update the HAR file with the actual network information instead of serving the requests from the HAR file. Use it when creating a test to populate the HAR with real data.\n\nAlternatively, you can also record HAR files by using the record_har_path option in browser.new_context() when creating a browser context. This allows you to capture all network traffic for the entire context until the context is closed.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef test_records_or_updates_the_har_file(page: Page):\n    # Get the response from the HAR file\n    page.route_from_har(\"./hars/fruit.har\", url=\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\", update=True)\n\n    # Go to the page\n    page.goto(\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\")\n\n    # Assert that the fruit is visible\n    expect(page.get_by_text(\"Strawberry\")).to_be_visible()\n\nModifying a HAR file�\n\nOnce you have recorded a HAR file you can modify it by opening the hashed .txt file inside your 'hars' folder and editing the JSON. This file should be committed to your source control. Anytime you run this test with update: true it will update your HAR file with the request from the API.\n\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Playwright\",\n    \"id\": 100\n  },\n  // ... other fruits\n]\n\nReplaying from HAR�\n\nNow that you have the HAR file recorded and modified the mock data, it can be used to serve matching responses in the test. For this, just turn off or simply remove the update option. This will run the test against the HAR file instead of hitting the API.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef test_gets_the_json_from_har_and_checks_the_new_fruit_has_been_added(page: Page):\n    # Replay API requests from HAR.\n    # Either use a matching response from the HAR,\n    # or abort the request if nothing matches.\n    page.route_from_har(\"./hars/fruit.har\", url=\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\", update=False)\n\n    # Go to the page\n    page.goto(\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\")\n\n    # Assert that the Playwright fruit is visible\n    expect(page.get_by_text(\"Playwright\", exact=True)).to_be_visible()\n\n\nIn the trace of our test we can see that the route was fulfilled from the HAR file and the API was not called. \n\nIf we inspect the response we can see our new fruit was added to the JSON, which was done by manually updating the hashed .txt file inside the hars folder. \n\nHAR replay matches URL and HTTP method strictly. For POST requests, it also matches POST payloads strictly. If multiple recordings match a request, the one with the most matching headers is picked. An entry resulting in a redirect will be followed automatically.\n\nSimilar to when recording, if given HAR file name ends with .zip, it is considered an archive containing the HAR file along with network payloads stored as separate entries. You can also extract this archive, edit payloads or HAR log manually and point to the extracted har file. All the payloads will be resolved relative to the extracted har file on the file system.\n\nRecording HAR with CLI�\n\nWe recommend the update option to record HAR file for your test. However, you can also record the HAR with Playwright CLI.\n\nOpen the browser with Playwright CLI and pass --save-har option to produce a HAR file. Optionally, use --save-har-glob to only save requests you are interested in, for example API endpoints. If the har file name ends with .zip, artifacts are written as separate files and are all compressed into a single zip.\n\n# Save API requests from example.com as \"example.har\" archive.\nplaywright open --save-har=example.har --save-har-glob=\"**/api/**\" https://example.com\n\n\nRead more about advanced networking.\n\nMock WebSockets�\n\nThe following code will intercept WebSocket connections and mock entire communication over the WebSocket, instead of connecting to the server. This example responds to a \"request\" with a \"response\".\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef message_handler(ws: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  if message == \"request\":\n    ws.send(\"response\")\n\npage.route_web_socket(\"wss://example.com/ws\", lambda ws: ws.on_message(\n    lambda message: message_handler(ws, message)\n))\n\n\nAlternatively, you may want to connect to the actual server, but intercept messages in-between and modify or block them. Here is an example that modifies some of the messages sent by the page to the server, and leaves the rest unmodified.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef message_handler(server: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  if message == \"request\":\n    server.send(\"request2\")\n  else:\n    server.send(message)\n\ndef handler(ws: WebSocketRoute):\n  server = ws.connect_to_server()\n  ws.on_message(lambda message: message_handler(server, message))\n\npage.route_web_socket(\"wss://example.com/ws\", handler)\n\n\nFor more details, see WebSocketRoute.\n\nPrevious\nLocators\nNext\nNavigations\nIntroduction\nMock API requests\nModify API responses\nMocking with HAR files\nRecording a HAR file\nModifying a HAR file\nReplaying from HAR\nMock WebSockets\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images.\n\nNOTE\n\nIf the page does a client-side redirect before load, page.goto() will wait for the redirected page to fire the load event.\n\nWhen is the page loaded?�\n\nModern pages perform numerous activities after the load event was fired. They fetch data lazily, populate UI, load expensive resources, scripts and styles after the load event was fired. There is no way to tell that the page is loaded, it depends on the page, framework, etc. So when can you start interacting with it?\n\nIn Playwright you can interact with the page at any moment. It will automatically wait for the target elements to become actionable.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Navigate and click element\n# Click will auto-wait for the element\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\npage.get_by_text(\"example domain\").click()\n\n\nFor the scenario above, Playwright will wait for the text to become visible, will wait for the rest of the actionability checks to pass for that element, and will click it.\n\nPlaywright operates as a very fast user - the moment it sees the button, it clicks it. In the general case, you don't need to worry about whether all the resources loaded, etc.\n\nHydration�\n\nAt some point in time, you'll stumble upon a use case where Playwright performs an action, but nothing seemingly happens. Or you enter some text into the input field and it will disappear. The most probable reason behind that is a poor page hydration.\n\nWhen page is hydrated, first, a static version of the page is sent to the browser. Then the dynamic part is sent and the page becomes \"live\". As a very fast user, Playwright will start interacting with the page the moment it sees it. And if the button on a page is enabled, but the listeners have not yet been added, Playwright will do its job, but the click won't have any effect.\n\nA simple way to verify if your page suffers from a poor hydration is to open Chrome DevTools, pick \"Slow 3G\" network emulation in the Network panel and reload the page. Once you see the element of interest, interact with it. You'll see that the button clicks will be ignored and the entered text will be reset by the subsequent page load code. The right fix for this issue is to make sure that all the interactive controls are disabled until after the hydration, when the page is fully functional.\n\nWaiting for navigation�\n\nClicking an element could trigger multiple navigations. In these cases, it is recommended to explicitly page.wait_for_url() to a specific url.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_text(\"Click me\").click()\npage.wait_for_url(\"**/login\")\n\nNavigation events�\n\nPlaywright splits the process of showing a new document in a page into navigation and loading.\n\nNavigation starts by changing the page URL or by interacting with the page (e.g., clicking a link). The navigation intent may be canceled, for example, on hitting an unresolved DNS address or transformed into a file download.\n\nNavigation is committed when the response headers have been parsed and session history is updated. Only after the navigation succeeds (is committed), the page starts loading the document.\n\nLoading covers getting the remaining response body over the network, parsing, executing the scripts and firing load events:\n\npage.url is set to the new url\ndocument content is loaded over network and parsed\npage.on(\"domcontentloaded\") event is fired\npage executes some scripts and loads resources like stylesheets and images\npage.on(\"load\") event is fired\npage executes dynamically loaded scripts\nPrevious\nMock APIs\nNext\nNetwork\nIntroduction\nBasic navigation\nWhen is the page loaded?\nHydration\nWaiting for navigation\nNavigation events\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

In a nutshell, locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment.\n\nQuick Guide�\n\nThese are the recommended built-in locators.\n\npage.get_by_role() to locate by explicit and implicit accessibility attributes.\npage.get_by_text() to locate by text content.\npage.get_by_label() to locate a form control by associated label's text.\npage.get_by_placeholder() to locate an input by placeholder.\npage.get_by_alt_text() to locate an element, usually image, by its text alternative.\npage.get_by_title() to locate an element by its title attribute.\npage.get_by_test_id() to locate an element based on its data-testid attribute (other attributes can be configured).\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_label(\"User Name\").fill(\"John\")\n\npage.get_by_label(\"Password\").fill(\"secret-password\")\n\npage.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Sign in\").click()\n\nexpect(page.get_by_text(\"Welcome, John!\")).to_be_visible()\n\nLocating elements�\n\nPlaywright comes with multiple built-in locators. To make tests resilient, we recommend prioritizing user-facing attributes and explicit contracts such as page.get_by_role().\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nSign in\n<button>Sign in</button>\n\n\nLocate the element by its role of button with name \"Sign in\".\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Sign in\").click()\n\nNOTE\n\nUse the code generator to generate a locator, and then edit it as you'd like.\n\nEvery time a locator is used for an action, an up-to-date DOM element is located in the page. In the snippet below, the underlying DOM element will be located twice, once prior to every action. This means that if the DOM changes in between the calls due to re-render, the new element corresponding to the locator will be used.\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator = page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Sign in\")\n\nlocator.hover()\nlocator.click()\n\n\nNote that all methods that create a locator, such as page.get_by_label(), are also available on the Locator and FrameLocator classes, so you can chain them and iteratively narrow down your locator.\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator = page.frame_locator(\"my-frame\").get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Sign in\")\n\nlocator.click()\n\nLocate by role�\n\nThe page.get_by_role() locator reflects how users and assistive technology perceive the page, for example whether some element is a button or a checkbox. When locating by role, you should usually pass the accessible name as well, so that the locator pinpoints the exact element.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nSign up\n\n Subscribe\n\n\nSubmit\n<h3>Sign up</h3>\n<label>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" /> Subscribe\n</label>\n<br/>\n<button>Submit</button>\n\n\nYou can locate each element by its implicit role:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Sign up\")).to_be_visible()\n\npage.get_by_role(\"checkbox\", name=\"Subscribe\").check()\n\npage.get_by_role(\"button\", name=re.compile(\"submit\", re.IGNORECASE)).click()\n\n\nRole locators include buttons, checkboxes, headings, links, lists, tables, and many more and follow W3C specifications for ARIA role, ARIA attributes and accessible name. Note that many html elements like <button> have an implicitly defined role that is recognized by the role locator.\n\nNote that role locators do not replace accessibility audits and conformance tests, but rather give early feedback about the ARIA guidelines.\n\nWHEN TO USE ROLE LOCATORS\n\nWe recommend prioritizing role locators to locate elements, as it is the closest way to how users and assistive technology perceive the page.\n\nLocate by label�\n\nMost form controls usually have dedicated labels that could be conveniently used to interact with the form. In this case, you can locate the control by its associated label using page.get_by_label().\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nPassword \n<label>Password <input type=\"password\" /></label>\n\n\n\nYou can fill the input after locating it by the label text:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_label(\"Password\").fill(\"secret\")\n\nWHEN TO USE LABEL LOCATORS\n\nUse this locator when locating form fields.\n\nLocate by placeholder�\n\nInputs may have a placeholder attribute to hint to the user what value should be entered. You can locate such an input using page.get_by_placeholder().\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\n<input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"name@example.com\" />\n\n\nYou can fill the input after locating it by the placeholder text:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_placeholder(\"name@example.com\").fill(\"playwright@microsoft.com\")\n\nWHEN TO USE PLACEHOLDER LOCATORS\n\nUse this locator when locating form elements that do not have labels but do have placeholder texts.\n\nLocate by text�\n\nFind an element by the text it contains. You can match by a substring, exact string, or a regular expression when using page.get_by_text().\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nWelcome, John\n<span>Welcome, John</span>\n\n\nYou can locate the element by the text it contains:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_text(\"Welcome, John\")).to_be_visible()\n\n\nSet an exact match:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_text(\"Welcome, John\", exact=True)).to_be_visible()\n\n\nMatch with a regular expression:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_text(re.compile(\"welcome, john\", re.IGNORECASE))).to_be_visible()\n\nNOTE\n\nMatching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nWHEN TO USE TEXT LOCATORS\n\nWe recommend using text locators to find non interactive elements like div, span, p, etc. For interactive elements like button, a, input, etc. use role locators.\n\nYou can also filter by text which can be useful when trying to find a particular item in a list.\n\nLocate by alt text�\n\nAll images should have an alt attribute that describes the image. You can locate an image based on the text alternative using page.get_by_alt_text().\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\n<img alt=\"playwright logo\" src=\"/img/playwright-logo.svg\" width=\"100\" />\n\n\nYou can click on the image after locating it by the text alternative:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_alt_text(\"playwright logo\").click()\n\nWHEN TO USE ALT LOCATORS\n\nUse this locator when your element supports alt text such as img and area elements.\n\nLocate by title�\n\nLocate an element with a matching title attribute using page.get_by_title().\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\n25 issues\n<span title='Issues count'>25 issues</span>\n\n\nYou can check the issues count after locating it by the title text:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_title(\"Issues count\")).to_have_text(\"25 issues\")\n\nWHEN TO USE TITLE LOCATORS\n\nUse this locator when your element has the title attribute.\n\nLocate by test id�\n\nTesting by test ids is the most resilient way of testing as even if your text or role of the attribute changes, the test will still pass. QA's and developers should define explicit test ids and query them with page.get_by_test_id(). However testing by test ids is not user facing. If the role or text value is important to you then consider using user facing locators such as role and text locators.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nItinéraire\n<button data-testid=\"directions\">Itinéraire</button>\n\n\nYou can locate the element by its test id:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_test_id(\"directions\").click()\n\nWHEN TO USE TESTID LOCATORS\n\nYou can also use test ids when you choose to use the test id methodology or when you can't locate by role or text.\n\nSet a custom test id attribute�\n\nBy default, page.get_by_test_id() will locate elements based on the data-testid attribute, but you can configure it in your test config or by calling selectors.set_test_id_attribute().\n\nSet the test id to use a custom data attribute for your tests.\n\nSync\nAsync\nplaywright.selectors.set_test_id_attribute(\"data-pw\")\n\n\nIn your html you can now use data-pw as your test id instead of the default data-testid.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nItinéraire\n<button data-pw=\"directions\">Itinéraire</button>\n\n\nAnd then locate the element as you would normally do:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_test_id(\"directions\").click()\n\nLocate by CSS or XPath�\n\nIf you absolutely must use CSS or XPath locators, you can use page.locator() to create a locator that takes a selector describing how to find an element in the page. Playwright supports CSS and XPath selectors, and auto-detects them if you omit css= or xpath= prefix.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"css=button\").click()\npage.locator(\"xpath=//button\").click()\n\npage.locator(\"button\").click()\npage.locator(\"//button\").click()\n\n\nXPath and CSS selectors can be tied to the DOM structure or implementation. These selectors can break when the DOM structure changes. Long CSS or XPath chains below are an example of a bad practice that leads to unstable tests:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\n    \"#tsf > div:nth-child(2) > div.A8SBwf > div.RNNXgb > div > div.a4bIc > input\"\n).click()\n\npage.locator('//*[@id=\"tsf\"]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[2]/input').click()\n\nWHEN TO USE THIS\n\nCSS and XPath are not recommended as the DOM can often change leading to non resilient tests. Instead, try to come up with a locator that is close to how the user perceives the page such as role locators or define an explicit testing contract using test ids.\n\nLocate in Shadow DOM�\n\nAll locators in Playwright by default work with elements in Shadow DOM. The exceptions are:\n\nLocating by XPath does not pierce shadow roots.\nClosed-mode shadow roots are not supported.\n\nConsider the following example with a custom web component:\n\n<x-details role=button aria-expanded=true aria-controls=inner-details>\n  <div>Title</div>\n  #shadow-root\n    <div id=inner-details>Details</div>\n</x-details>\n\n\nYou can locate in the same way as if the shadow root was not present at all.\n\nTo click <div>Details</div>:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_text(\"Details\").click()\n\n<x-details role=button aria-expanded=true aria-controls=inner-details>\n  <div>Title</div>\n  #shadow-root\n    <div id=inner-details>Details</div>\n</x-details>\n\n\nTo click <x-details>:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"x-details\", has_text=\"Details\").click()\n\n<x-details role=button aria-expanded=true aria-controls=inner-details>\n  <div>Title</div>\n  #shadow-root\n    <div id=inner-details>Details</div>\n</x-details>\n\n\nTo ensure that <x-details> contains the text \"Details\":\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.locator(\"x-details\")).to_contain_text(\"Details\")\n\nFiltering Locators�\n\nConsider the following DOM structure where we want to click on the buy button of the second product card. We have a few options in order to filter the locators to get the right one.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nProduct 1\nAdd to cart\nProduct 2\nAdd to cart\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <h3>Product 1</h3>\n    <button>Add to cart</button>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <h3>Product 2</h3>\n    <button>Add to cart</button>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nFilter by text�\n\nLocators can be filtered by text with the locator.filter() method. It will search for a particular string somewhere inside the element, possibly in a descendant element, case-insensitively. You can also pass a regular expression.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(has_text=\"Product 2\").get_by_role(\n    \"button\", name=\"Add to cart\"\n).click()\n\n\nUse a regular expression:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(has_text=re.compile(\"Product 2\")).get_by_role(\n    \"button\", name=\"Add to cart\"\n).click()\n\nFilter by not having text�\n\nAlternatively, filter by not having text:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# 5 in-stock items\nexpect(page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(has_not_text=\"Out of stock\")).to_have_count(5)\n\nFilter by child/descendant�\n\nLocators support an option to only select elements that have or have not a descendant matching another locator. You can therefore filter by any other locator such as a locator.get_by_role(), locator.get_by_test_id(), locator.get_by_text() etc.\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nProduct 1\nAdd to cart\nProduct 2\nAdd to cart\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <h3>Product 1</h3>\n    <button>Add to cart</button>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <h3>Product 2</h3>\n    <button>Add to cart</button>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(\n    has=page.get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Product 2\")\n).get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Add to cart\").click()\n\n\nWe can also assert the product card to make sure there is only one:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(\n    page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(\n        has=page.get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Product 2\")\n    )\n).to_have_count(1)\n\n\nThe filtering locator must be relative to the original locator and is queried starting with the original locator match, not the document root. Therefore, the following will not work, because the filtering locator starts matching from the <ul> list element that is outside of the <li> list item matched by the original locator:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# × WRONG\nexpect(\n    page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(\n        has=page.get_by_role(\"list\").get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Product 2\")\n    )\n).to_have_count(1)\n\nFilter by not having child/descendant�\n\nWe can also filter by not having a matching element inside.\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(\n    page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(\n        has_not=page.get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Product 2\")\n    )\n).to_have_count(1)\n\n\nNote that the inner locator is matched starting from the outer one, not from the document root.\n\nLocator operators�\nMatching inside a locator�\n\nYou can chain methods that create a locator, like page.get_by_text() or locator.get_by_role(), to narrow down the search to a particular part of the page.\n\nIn this example we first create a locator called product by locating its role of listitem. We then filter by text. We can use the product locator again to get by role of button and click it and then use an assertion to make sure there is only one product with the text \"Product 2\".\n\nSync\nAsync\nproduct = page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(has_text=\"Product 2\")\n\nproduct.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Add to cart\").click()\n\n\nYou can also chain two locators together, for example to find a \"Save\" button inside a particular dialog:\n\nSync\nAsync\nsave_button = page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Save\")\n# ...\ndialog = page.get_by_test_id(\"settings-dialog\")\ndialog.locator(save_button).click()\n\nMatching two locators simultaneously�\n\nMethod locator.and_() narrows down an existing locator by matching an additional locator. For example, you can combine page.get_by_role() and page.get_by_title() to match by both role and title.\n\nSync\nAsync\nbutton = page.get_by_role(\"button\").and_(page.getByTitle(\"Subscribe\"))\n\nMatching one of the two alternative locators�\n\nIf you'd like to target one of the two or more elements, and you don't know which one it will be, use locator.or_() to create a locator that matches any one or both of the alternatives.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where you'd like to click on a \"New email\" button, but sometimes a security settings dialog shows up instead. In this case, you can wait for either a \"New email\" button, or a dialog and act accordingly.\n\nNOTE\n\nIf both \"New email\" button and security dialog appear on screen, the \"or\" locator will match both of them, possibly throwing the \"strict mode violation\" error. In this case, you can use locator.first to only match one of them.\n\nSync\nAsync\nnew_email = page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"New\")\ndialog = page.get_by_text(\"Confirm security settings\")\nexpect(new_email.or_(dialog).first).to_be_visible()\nif (dialog.is_visible()):\n  page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Dismiss\").click()\nnew_email.click()\n\nMatching only visible elements�\nNOTE\n\nIt's usually better to find a more reliable way to uniquely identify the element instead of checking the visibility.\n\nConsider a page with two buttons, the first invisible and the second visible.\n\n<button style='display: none'>Invisible</button>\n<button>Visible</button>\n\n\nThis will find both buttons and throw a strictness violation error:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"button\").click()\n\n\nThis will only find a second button, because it is visible, and then click it.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"button\").filter(visible=True).click()\n\nLists�\nCount items in a list�\n\nYou can assert locators in order to count the items in a list.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\napple\nbanana\norange\n<ul>\n  <li>apple</li>\n  <li>banana</li>\n  <li>orange</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nUse the count assertion to ensure that the list has 3 items.\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_role(\"listitem\")).to_have_count(3)\n\nAssert all text in a list�\n\nYou can assert locators in order to find all the text in a list.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\napple\nbanana\norange\n<ul>\n  <li>apple</li>\n  <li>banana</li>\n  <li>orange</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nUse expect(locator).to_have_text() to ensure that the list has the text \"apple\", \"banana\" and \"orange\".\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_role(\"listitem\")).to_have_text([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"])\n\nGet a specific item�\n\nThere are many ways to get a specific item in a list.\n\nGet by text�\n\nUse the page.get_by_text() method to locate an element in a list by its text content and then click on it.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\napple\nbanana\norange\n<ul>\n  <li>apple</li>\n  <li>banana</li>\n  <li>orange</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nLocate an item by its text content and click it.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_text(\"orange\").click()\n\nFilter by text�\n\nUse the locator.filter() to locate a specific item in a list.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\napple\nbanana\norange\n<ul>\n  <li>apple</li>\n  <li>banana</li>\n  <li>orange</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nLocate an item by the role of \"listitem\" and then filter by the text of \"orange\" and then click it.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(has_text=\"orange\").click()\n\nGet by test id�\n\nUse the page.get_by_test_id() method to locate an element in a list. You may need to modify the html and add a test id if you don't already have a test id.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\napple\nbanana\norange\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid='apple'>apple</li>\n  <li data-testid='banana'>banana</li>\n  <li data-testid='orange'>orange</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nLocate an item by its test id of \"orange\" and then click it.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_test_id(\"orange\").click()\n\nGet by nth item�\n\nIf you have a list of identical elements, and the only way to distinguish between them is the order, you can choose a specific element from a list with locator.first, locator.last or locator.nth().\n\nSync\nAsync\nbanana = page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").nth(1)\n\n\nHowever, use this method with caution. Often times, the page might change, and the locator will point to a completely different element from the one you expected. Instead, try to come up with a unique locator that will pass the strictness criteria.\n\nChaining filters�\n\nWhen you have elements with various similarities, you can use the locator.filter() method to select the right one. You can also chain multiple filters to narrow down the selection.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\nJohn\nSay hello\nMary\nSay hello\nJohn\nSay goodbye\nMary\nSay goodbye\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <div>John</div>\n    <div><button>Say hello</button></div>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <div>Mary</div>\n    <div><button>Say hello</button></div>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <div>John</div>\n    <div><button>Say goodbye</button></div>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <div>Mary</div>\n    <div><button>Say goodbye</button></div>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\nTo take a screenshot of the row with \"Mary\" and \"Say goodbye\":\n\nSync\nAsync\nrow_locator = page.get_by_role(\"listitem\")\n\nrow_locator.filter(has_text=\"Mary\").filter(\n    has=page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Say goodbye\")\n).screenshot(path=\"screenshot.png\")\n\n\nYou should now have a \"screenshot.png\" file in your project's root directory.\n\nRare use cases�\nDo something with each element in the list�\n\nIterate elements:\n\nSync\nAsync\nfor row in page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").all():\n    print(row.text_content())\n\n\nIterate using regular for loop:\n\nSync\nAsync\nrows = page.get_by_role(\"listitem\")\ncount = rows.count()\nfor i in range(count):\n    print(rows.nth(i).text_content())\n\nEvaluate in the page�\n\nThe code inside locator.evaluate_all() runs in the page, you can call any DOM apis there.\n\nSync\nAsync\nrows = page.get_by_role(\"listitem\")\ntexts = rows.evaluate_all(\"list => list.map(element => element.textContent)\")\n\nStrictness�\n\nLocators are strict. This means that all operations on locators that imply some target DOM element will throw an exception if more than one element matches. For example, the following call throws if there are several buttons in the DOM:\n\nThrows an error if more than one�\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").click()\n\n\nOn the other hand, Playwright understands when you perform a multiple-element operation, so the following call works perfectly fine when the locator resolves to multiple elements.\n\nWorks fine with multiple elements�\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").count()\n\n\nYou can explicitly opt-out from strictness check by telling Playwright which element to use when multiple elements match, through locator.first, locator.last, and locator.nth(). These methods are not recommended because when your page changes, Playwright may click on an element you did not intend. Instead, follow best practices above to create a locator that uniquely identifies the target element.\n\nMore Locators�\n\nFor less commonly used locators, look at the other locators guide.\n\nPrevious\nIsolation\nNext\nMock APIs\nIntroduction\nQuick Guide\nLocating elements\nLocate by role\nLocate by label\nLocate by placeholder\nLocate by text\nLocate by alt text\nLocate by title\nLocate by test id\nLocate by CSS or XPath\nLocate in Shadow DOM\nFiltering Locators\nFilter by text\nFilter by not having text\nFilter by child/descendant\nFilter by not having child/descendant\nLocator operators\nMatching inside a locator\nMatching two locators simultaneously\nMatching one of the two alternative locators\nMatching only visible elements\nLists\nCount items in a list\nAssert all text in a list\nGet a specific item\nChaining filters\nRare use cases\nStrictness\nMore Locators\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Any requests that a page does, including XHRs and fetch requests, can be tracked, modified and handled.\n\nMock APIs�\n\nCheck out our API mocking guide to learn more on how to\n\nmock API requests and never hit the API\nperform the API request and modify the response\nuse HAR files to mock network requests.\nHTTP Authentication�\n\nPerform HTTP Authentication.\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext = browser.new_context(\n    http_credentials={\"username\": \"bill\", \"password\": \"pa55w0rd\"}\n)\npage = context.new_page()\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n\nHTTP Proxy�\n\nYou can configure pages to load over the HTTP(S) proxy or SOCKSv5. Proxy can be either set globally for the entire browser, or for each browser context individually.\n\nYou can optionally specify username and password for HTTP(S) proxy, you can also specify hosts to bypass the proxy for.\n\nHere is an example of a global proxy:\n\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser = chromium.launch(proxy={\n  \"server\": \"http://myproxy.com:3128\",\n  \"username\": \"usr\",\n  \"password\": \"pwd\"\n})\n\n\nIts also possible to specify it per context:\n\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser = chromium.launch()\ncontext = browser.new_context(proxy={\"server\": \"http://myproxy.com:3128\"})\n\nNetwork events�\n\nYou can monitor all the Requests and Responses:\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright\n\ndef run(playwright: Playwright):\n    chromium = playwright.chromium\n    browser = chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    # Subscribe to \"request\" and \"response\" events.\n    page.on(\"request\", lambda request: print(\">>\", request.method, request.url))\n    page.on(\"response\", lambda response: print(\"<<\", response.status, response.url))\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n    browser.close()\n\nwith sync_playwright() as playwright:\n    run(playwright)\n\n\nOr wait for a network response after the button click with page.expect_response():\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Use a glob url pattern\nwith page.expect_response(\"**/api/fetch_data\") as response_info:\n    page.get_by_text(\"Update\").click()\nresponse = response_info.value\n\nVariations�\n\nWait for Responses with page.expect_response()\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Use a regular expression\nwith page.expect_response(re.compile(r\"\\.jpeg$\")) as response_info:\n    page.get_by_text(\"Update\").click()\nresponse = response_info.value\n\n# Use a predicate taking a response object\nwith page.expect_response(lambda response: token in response.url) as response_info:\n    page.get_by_text(\"Update\").click()\nresponse = response_info.value\n\nHandle requests�\nSync\nAsync\npage.route(\n    \"**/api/fetch_data\",\n    lambda route: route.fulfill(status=200, body=test_data))\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n\n\nYou can mock API endpoints via handling the network requests in your Playwright script.\n\nVariations�\n\nSet up route on the entire browser context with browser_context.route() or page with page.route(). It will apply to popup windows and opened links.\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext.route(\n    \"**/api/login\",\n    lambda route: route.fulfill(status=200, body=\"accept\"))\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n\nModify requests�\nSync\nAsync\n# Delete header\ndef handle_route(route):\n    headers = route.request.headers\n    del headers[\"x-secret\"]\n    route.continue_(headers=headers)\npage.route(\"**/*\", handle_route)\n\n# Continue requests as POST.\npage.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.continue_(method=\"POST\"))\n\n\nYou can continue requests with modifications. Example above removes an HTTP header from the outgoing requests.\n\nAbort requests�\n\nYou can abort requests using page.route() and route.abort().\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.route(\"**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}\", lambda route: route.abort())\n\n# Abort based on the request type\npage.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.abort() if route.request.resource_type == \"image\"  else route.continue_())\n\nModify responses�\n\nTo modify a response use APIRequestContext to get the original response and then pass the response to route.fulfill(). You can override individual fields on the response via options:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef handle_route(route: Route) -> None:\n    # Fetch original response.\n    response = route.fetch()\n    # Add a prefix to the title.\n    body = response.text()\n    body = body.replace(\"<title>\", \"<title>My prefix:\")\n    route.fulfill(\n        # Pass all fields from the response.\n        response=response,\n        # Override response body.\n        body=body,\n        # Force content type to be html.\n        headers={**response.headers, \"content-type\": \"text/html\"},\n    )\n\npage.route(\"**/title.html\", handle_route)\n\nGlob URL patterns�\n\nPlaywright uses simplified glob patterns for URL matching in network interception methods like page.route() or page.expect_response(). These patterns support basic wildcards:\n\nAsterisks:\nA single * matches any characters except /\nA double ** matches any characters including /\nQuestion mark ? matches only question mark ?. If you want to match any character, use * instead.\nCurly braces {} can be used to match a list of options separated by commas ,\nBackslash \\ can be used to escape any of special characters (note to escape backslash itself as \\\\)\n\nExamples:\n\nhttps://example.com/*.js matches https://example.com/file.js but not https://example.com/path/file.js\nhttps://example.com/?page=1 matches https://example.com/?page=1 but not https://example.com\n**/*.js matches both https://example.com/file.js and https://example.com/path/file.js\n**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg} matches all image requests\n\nImportant notes:\n\nThe glob pattern must match the entire URL, not just a part of it.\nWhen using globs for URL matching, consider the full URL structure, including the protocol and path separators.\nFor more complex matching requirements, consider using [RegExp] instead of glob patterns.\nWebSockets�\n\nPlaywright supports WebSockets inspection, mocking and modifying out of the box. See our API mocking guide to learn how to mock WebSockets.\n\nEvery time a WebSocket is created, the page.on(\"websocket\") event is fired. This event contains the WebSocket instance for further web socket frames inspection:\n\ndef on_web_socket(ws):\n    print(f\"WebSocket opened: {ws.url}\")\n    ws.on(\"framesent\", lambda payload: print(payload))\n    ws.on(\"framereceived\", lambda payload: print(payload))\n    ws.on(\"close\", lambda payload: print(\"WebSocket closed\"))\n\npage.on(\"websocket\", on_web_socket)\n\nMissing Network Events and Service Workers�\n\nPlaywright's built-in browser_context.route() and page.route() allow your tests to natively route requests and perform mocking and interception.\n\nIf you're using Playwright's native browser_context.route() and page.route(), and it appears network events are missing, disable Service Workers by setting service_workers to 'block'.\n\nIt might be that you are using a mock tool such as Mock Service Worker (MSW). While this tool works out of the box for mocking responses, it adds its own Service Worker that takes over the network requests, hence making them invisible to browser_context.route() and page.route(). If you are interested in both network testing and mocking, consider using built-in browser_context.route() and page.route() for response mocking.\n\nPrevious\nNavigations\nNext\nOther locators\nIntroduction\nMock APIs\nHTTP Authentication\nHTTP Proxy\nNetwork events\nHandle requests\nModify requests\nAbort requests\nModify responses\nGlob URL patterns\nWebSockets\nMissing Network Events and Service Workers\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Matching is case-insensitive, trims whitespace and searches for a substring.\n\nFor example, article:has-text(\"Playwright\") matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nNote that :has-text() should be used together with other CSS specifiers, otherwise it will match all the elements containing specified text, including the <body>.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Wrong, will match many elements including <body>\npage.locator(':has-text(\"Playwright\")').click()\n# Correct, only matches the <article> element\npage.locator('article:has-text(\"All products\")').click()\n\n\n#nav-bar :text(\"Home\") - the :text() pseudo-class matches the smallest element containing specified text. Matching is case-insensitive, trims whitespace and searches for a substring.\n\nFor example, this will find an element with text \"Home\" somewhere inside the #nav-bar element:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"#nav-bar :text('Home')\").click()\n\n\n#nav-bar :text-is(\"Home\") - the :text-is() pseudo-class matches the smallest element with exact text. Exact matching is case-sensitive, trims whitespace and searches for the full string.\n\nFor example, :text-is(\"Log\") does not match <button>Log in</button> because <button> contains a single text node \"Log in\" that is not equal to \"Log\". However, :text-is(\"Log\") matches <button> Log <span>in</span></button>, because <button> contains a text node \" Log \".\n\nSimilarly, :text-is(\"Download\") will not match <button>download</button> because it is case-sensitive.\n\n#nav-bar :text-matches(\"reg?ex\", \"i\") - the :text-matches() pseudo-class matches the smallest element with text content matching the JavaScript-like regex.\n\nFor example, :text-matches(\"Log\\s*in\", \"i\") matches <button>Login</button> and <button>log IN</button>.\n\nNOTE\n\nText matching always normalizes whitespace. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nNOTE\n\nInput elements of the type button and submit are matched by their value instead of text content. For example, :text(\"Log in\") matches <input type=button value=\"Log in\">.\n\nCSS: matching only visible elements�\n\nPlaywright supports the :visible pseudo class in CSS selectors. For example, css=button matches all the buttons on the page, while css=button:visible only matches visible buttons. This is useful to distinguish elements that are very similar but differ in visibility.\n\nConsider a page with two buttons, first invisible and second visible.\n\n<button style='display: none'>Invisible</button>\n<button>Visible</button>\n\n\nThis will find both buttons and throw a strictness violation error:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"button\").click()\n\n\nThis will only find a second button, because it is visible, and then click it.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"button:visible\").click()\n\nCSS: elements that contain other elements�\n\nThe :has() pseudo-class is an experimental CSS pseudo-class. It returns an element if any of the selectors passed as parameters relative to the :scope of the given element match at least one element.\n\nFollowing snippet returns text content of an <article> element that has a <div class=promo> inside.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"article:has(div.promo)\").text_content()\n\nCSS: elements matching one of the conditions�\n\nComma-separated list of CSS selectors will match all elements that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Clicks a <button> that has either a \"Log in\" or \"Sign in\" text.\npage.locator('button:has-text(\"Log in\"), button:has-text(\"Sign in\")').click()\n\n\nThe :is() pseudo-class is an experimental CSS pseudo-class that may be useful for specifying a list of extra conditions on an element.\n\nCSS: matching elements based on layout�\nWARNING\n\nLayout selectors are deprecated and may be removed in the future. Matching based on layout may produce unexpected results. For example, a different element could be matched when layout changes by one pixel.\n\nWe recommend prioritizing user-visible locators instead.\n\nSometimes, it is hard to come up with a good selector to the target element when it lacks distinctive features. In this case, using Playwright layout CSS pseudo-classes could help. These can be combined with regular CSS to pinpoint one of the multiple choices.\n\nFor example, input:right-of(:text(\"Password\")) matches an input field that is to the right of text \"Password\" - useful when the page has multiple inputs that are hard to distinguish between each other.\n\nNote that layout pseudo-classes are useful in addition to something else, like input. If you use a layout pseudo-class alone, like :right-of(:text(\"Password\")), most likely you'll get not the input you are looking for, but some empty element in between the text and the target input.\n\nLayout pseudo-classes use bounding client rect to compute distance and relative position of the elements.\n\n:right-of(div > button) - Matches elements that are to the right of any element matching the inner selector, at any vertical position.\n:left-of(div > button) - Matches elements that are to the left of any element matching the inner selector, at any vertical position.\n:above(div > button) - Matches elements that are above any of the elements matching the inner selector, at any horizontal position.\n:below(div > button) - Matches elements that are below any of the elements matching the inner selector, at any horizontal position.\n:near(div > button) - Matches elements that are near (within 50 CSS pixels) any of the elements matching the inner selector.\n\nNote that resulting matches are sorted by their distance to the anchor element, so you can use locator.first to pick the closest one. This is only useful if you have something like a list of similar elements, where the closest is obviously the right one. However, using locator.first in other cases most likely won't work as expected - it will not target the element you are searching for, but some other element that happens to be the closest like a random empty <div>, or an element that is scrolled out and is not currently visible.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Fill an input to the right of \"Username\".\npage.locator(\"input:right-of(:text(\\\"Username\\\"))\").fill(\"value\")\n\n# Click a button near the promo card.\npage.locator(\"button:near(.promo-card)\").click()\n\n# Click the radio input in the list closest to the \"Label 3\".\npage.locator(\"[type=radio]:left-of(:text(\\\"Label 3\\\"))\").first.click()\n\n\nAll layout pseudo-classes support optional maximum pixel distance as the last argument. For example button:near(:text(\"Username\"), 120) matches a button that is at most 120 CSS pixels away from the element with the text \"Username\".\n\nCSS: pick n-th match from the query result�\nNOTE\n\nIt is usually possible to distinguish elements by some attribute or text content, which is more resilient to page changes.\n\nSometimes page contains a number of similar elements, and it is hard to select a particular one. For example:\n\n<section> <button>Buy</button> </section>\n<article><div> <button>Buy</button> </div></article>\n<div><div> <button>Buy</button> </div></div>\n\n\nIn this case, :nth-match(:text(\"Buy\"), 3) will select the third button from the snippet above. Note that index is one-based.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Click the third \"Buy\" button\npage.locator(\":nth-match(:text('Buy'), 3)\").click()\n\n\n:nth-match() is also useful to wait until a specified number of elements appear, using locator.wait_for().\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Wait until all three buttons are visible\npage.locator(\":nth-match(:text('Buy'), 3)\").wait_for()\n\nNOTE\n\nUnlike :nth-child(), elements do not have to be siblings, they could be anywhere on the page. In the snippet above, all three buttons match :text(\"Buy\") selector, and :nth-match() selects the third button.\n\nN-th element locator�\n\nYou can narrow down query to the n-th match using the nth= locator passing a zero-based index.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Click first button\npage.locator(\"button\").locator(\"nth=0\").click()\n\n# Click last button\npage.locator(\"button\").locator(\"nth=-1\").click()\n\nParent element locator�\n\nWhen you need to target a parent element of some other element, most of the time you should locator.filter() by the child locator. For example, consider the following DOM structure:\n\n<li><label>Hello</label></li>\n<li><label>World</label></li>\n\n\nIf you'd like to target the parent <li> of a label with text \"Hello\", using locator.filter() works best:\n\nSync\nAsync\nchild = page.get_by_text(\"Hello\")\nparent = page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").filter(has=child)\n\n\nAlternatively, if you cannot find a suitable locator for the parent element, use xpath=... Note that this method is not as reliable, because any changes to the DOM structure will break your tests. Prefer locator.filter() when possible.\n\nSync\nAsync\nparent = page.get_by_text(\"Hello\").locator('xpath=..')\n\nReact locator�\nNOTE\n\nReact locator is experimental and prefixed with _. The functionality might change in future.\n\nReact locator allows finding elements by their component name and property values. The syntax is very similar to CSS attribute selectors and supports all CSS attribute selector operators.\n\nIn React locator, component names are transcribed with CamelCase.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"_react=BookItem\").click()\n\n\nMore examples:\n\nmatch by component: _react=BookItem\nmatch by component and exact property value, case-sensitive: _react=BookItem[author = \"Steven King\"]\nmatch by property value only, case-insensitive: _react=[author = \"steven king\" i]\nmatch by component and truthy property value: _react=MyButton[enabled]\nmatch by component and boolean value: _react=MyButton[enabled = false]\nmatch by property value substring: _react=[author *= \"King\"]\nmatch by component and multiple properties: _react=BookItem[author *= \"king\" i][year = 1990]\nmatch by nested property value: _react=[some.nested.value = 12]\nmatch by component and property value prefix: _react=BookItem[author ^= \"Steven\"]\nmatch by component and property value suffix: _react=BookItem[author $= \"Steven\"]\nmatch by component and key: _react=BookItem[key = '2']\nmatch by property value regex: _react=[author = /Steven(\\\\s+King)?/i]\n\nTo find React element names in a tree use React DevTools.\n\nNOTE\n\nReact locator supports React 15 and above.\n\nNOTE\n\nReact locator, as well as React DevTools, only work against unminified application builds.\n\nVue locator�\nNOTE\n\nVue locator is experimental and prefixed with _. The functionality might change in future.\n\nVue locator allows finding elements by their component name and property values. The syntax is very similar to CSS attribute selectors and supports all CSS attribute selector operators.\n\nIn Vue locator, component names are transcribed with kebab-case.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"_vue=book-item\").click()\n\n\nMore examples:\n\nmatch by component: _vue=book-item\nmatch by component and exact property value, case-sensitive: _vue=book-item[author = \"Steven King\"]\nmatch by property value only, case-insensitive: _vue=[author = \"steven king\" i]\nmatch by component and truthy property value: _vue=my-button[enabled]\nmatch by component and boolean value: _vue=my-button[enabled = false]\nmatch by property value substring: _vue=[author *= \"King\"]\nmatch by component and multiple properties: _vue=book-item[author *= \"king\" i][year = 1990]\nmatch by nested property value: _vue=[some.nested.value = 12]\nmatch by component and property value prefix: _vue=book-item[author ^= \"Steven\"]\nmatch by component and property value suffix: _vue=book-item[author $= \"Steven\"]\nmatch by property value regex: _vue=[author = /Steven(\\\\s+King)?/i]\n\nTo find Vue element names in a tree use Vue DevTools.\n\nNOTE\n\nVue locator supports Vue2 and above.\n\nNOTE\n\nVue locator, as well as Vue DevTools, only work against unminified application builds.\n\nXPath locator�\nWARNING\n\nWe recommend prioritizing user-visible locators like text or accessible role instead of using XPath that is tied to the implementation and easily break when the page changes.\n\nXPath locators are equivalent to calling Document.evaluate.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"xpath=//button\").click()\n\nNOTE\n\nAny selector string starting with // or .. are assumed to be an xpath selector. For example, Playwright converts '//html/body' to 'xpath=//html/body'.\n\nNOTE\n\nXPath does not pierce shadow roots.\n\nXPath union�\n\nPipe operator (|) can be used to specify multiple selectors in XPath. It will match all elements that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Waits for either confirmation dialog or load spinner.\npage.locator(\"//span[contains(@class, 'spinner__loading')]|//div[@id='confirmation']\").wait_for()\n\nLabel to form control retargeting�\nWARNING\n\nWe recommend locating by label text instead of relying to label-to-control retargeting.\n\nTargeted input actions in Playwright automatically distinguish between labels and controls, so you can target the label to perform an action on the associated control.\n\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure: <label for=\"password\">Password:</label><input id=\"password\" type=\"password\">. You can target the label by its \"Password\" text using page.get_by_text(). However, the following actions will be performed on the input instead of the label:\n\nlocator.click() will click the label and automatically focus the input field;\nlocator.fill() will fill the input field;\nlocator.input_value() will return the value of the input field;\nlocator.select_text() will select text in the input field;\nlocator.set_input_files() will set files for the input field with type=file;\nlocator.select_option() will select an option from the select box.\nSync\nAsync\n# Fill the input by targeting the label.\npage.get_by_text(\"Password\").fill(\"secret\")\n\n\nHowever, other methods will target the label itself, for example expect(locator).to_have_text() will assert the text content of the label, not the input field.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Fill the input by targeting the label.\nexpect(page.locator(\"label\")).to_have_text(\"Password\")\n\nLegacy text locator�\nWARNING\n\nWe recommend the modern text locator instead.\n\nLegacy text locator matches elements that contain passed text.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"text=Log in\").click()\n\n\nLegacy text locator has a few variations:\n\ntext=Log in - default matching is case-insensitive, trims whitespace and searches for a substring. For example, text=Log matches <button>Log in</button>.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"text=Log in\").click()\n\n\ntext=\"Log in\" - text body can be escaped with single or double quotes to search for a text node with exact content after trimming whitespace.\n\nFor example, text=\"Log\" does not match <button>Log in</button> because <button> contains a single text node \"Log in\" that is not equal to \"Log\". However, text=\"Log\" matches <button> Log <span>in</span></button>, because <button> contains a text node \" Log \". This exact mode implies case-sensitive matching, so text=\"Download\" will not match <button>download</button>.\n\nQuoted body follows the usual escaping rules, e.g. use \\\" to escape double quote in a double-quoted string: text=\"foo\\\"bar\".\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"text='Log in'\").click()\n\n\n/Log\\s*in/i - body can be a JavaScript-like regex wrapped in / symbols. For example, text=/Log\\s*in/i matches <button>Login</button> and <button>log IN</button>.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"text=/Log\\s*in/i\").click()\n\nNOTE\n\nString selectors starting and ending with a quote (either \" or ') are assumed to be a legacy text locators. For example, \"Log in\" is converted to text=\"Log in\" internally.\n\nNOTE\n\nMatching always normalizes whitespace. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nNOTE\n\nInput elements of the type button and submit are matched by their value instead of text content. For example, text=Log in matches <input type=button value=\"Log in\">.\n\nid, data-testid, data-test-id, data-test selectors�\nWARNING\n\nWe recommend locating by test id instead.\n\nPlaywright supports shorthand for selecting elements using certain attributes. Currently, only the following attributes are supported:\n\nid\ndata-testid\ndata-test-id\ndata-test\nSync\nAsync\n# Fill an input with the id \"username\"\npage.locator('id=username').fill('value')\n\n# Click an element with data-test-id \"submit\"\npage.locator('data-test-id=submit').click()\n\nNOTE\n\nAttribute selectors are not CSS selectors, so anything CSS-specific like :enabled is not supported. For more features, use a proper css selector, e.g. css=[data-test=\"login\"]:enabled.\n\nChaining selectors�\nWARNING\n\nWe recommend chaining locators instead.\n\nSelectors defined as engine=body or in short-form can be combined with the >> token, e.g. selector1 >> selector2 >> selectors3. When selectors are chained, the next one is queried relative to the previous one's result.\n\nFor example,\n\ncss=article >> css=.bar > .baz >> css=span[attr=value]\n\n\nis equivalent to\n\ndocument\n    .querySelector('article')\n    .querySelector('.bar > .baz')\n    .querySelector('span[attr=value]');\n\n\nIf a selector needs to include >> in the body, it should be escaped inside a string to not be confused with chaining separator, e.g. text=\"some >> text\".\n\nIntermediate matches�\nWARNING\n\nWe recommend filtering by another locator to locate elements that contain other elements.\n\nBy default, chained selectors resolve to an element queried by the last selector. A selector can be prefixed with * to capture elements that are queried by an intermediate selector.\n\nFor example, css=article >> text=Hello captures the element with the text Hello, and *css=article >> text=Hello (note the *) captures the article element that contains some element with the text Hello.\n\nPrevious\nNetwork\nNext\nPages\nIntroduction\nCSS locator\nCSS: matching by text\nCSS: matching only visible elements\nCSS: elements that contain other elements\nCSS: elements matching one of the conditions\nCSS: matching elements based on layout\nCSS: pick n-th match from the query result\nN-th element locator\nParent element locator\nReact locator\nVue locator\nXPath locator\nXPath union\nLabel to form control retargeting\nLegacy text locator\nid, data-testid, data-test-id, data-test selectors\nChaining selectors\nIntermediate matches\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Page object models are one such approach to structure your test suite.\n\nA page object represents a part of your web application. An e-commerce web application might have a home page, a listings page and a checkout page. Each of them can be represented by page object models.\n\nPage objects simplify authoring by creating a higher-level API which suits your application and simplify maintenance by capturing element selectors in one place and create reusable code to avoid repetition.\n\nImplementation�\n\nPage object models wrap over a Playwright Page.\n\nSync\nAsync\nmodels/search.py\nclass SearchPage:\n    def __init__(self, page):\n        self.page = page\n        self.search_term_input = page.locator('[aria-label=\"Enter your search term\"]')\n\n    def navigate(self):\n        self.page.goto(\"https://bing.com\")\n\n    def search(self, text):\n        self.search_term_input.fill(text)\n        self.search_term_input.press(\"Enter\")\n\n\nPage objects can then be used inside a test.\n\nSync\nAsync\ntest_search.py\nfrom models.search import SearchPage\n\n# in the test\npage = browser.new_page()\nsearch_page = SearchPage(page)\nsearch_page.navigate()\nsearch_page.search(\"search query\")\n\nPrevious\nPages\nNext\nScreenshots\nIntroduction\nImplementation\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

For instance, with Playwright, expect(locator).to_have_text() verifies that an element contains the expected text, and expect(locator).to_have_value() confirms that an input field has the expected value. Assertion tests are specific and generally check the current state of an element or property against an expected, predefined state. They work well for predictable, single-value checks but are limited in scope when testing the broader structure or variations.\n\nAdvantages\n\nClarity: The intent of the test is explicit and easy to understand.\nSpecificity: Tests focus on particular aspects of functionality, making them more robust against unrelated changes.\nDebugging: Failures provide targeted feedback, pointing directly to the problematic aspect.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nVerbose for complex outputs: Writing assertions for complex data structures or large outputs can be cumbersome and error-prone.\nMaintenance overhead: As code evolves, manually updating assertions can be time-consuming.\nSnapshot testing�\n\nSnapshot testing captures a “snapshot” or representation of the entire state of an element, component, or data at a given moment, which is then saved for future comparisons. When re-running tests, the current state is compared to the snapshot, and if there are differences, the test fails. This approach is especially useful for complex or dynamic structures, where manually asserting each detail would be too time-consuming. Snapshot testing is broader and more holistic than assertion testing, allowing you to track more complex changes over time.\n\nAdvantages\n\nSimplifies complex outputs: For example, testing a UI component's rendered output can be tedious with traditional assertions. Snapshots capture the entire output for easy comparison.\nQuick Feedback loop: Developers can easily spot unintended changes in the output.\nEncourages consistency: Helps maintain consistent output as code evolves.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nOver-Reliance: It can be tempting to accept changes to snapshots without fully understanding them, potentially hiding bugs.\nGranularity: Large snapshots may be hard to interpret when differences arise, especially if minor changes affect large portions of the output.\nSuitability: Not ideal for highly dynamic content where outputs change frequently or unpredictably.\nWhen to use�\nSnapshot testing is ideal for:\nUI testing of whole pages and components.\nBroad structural checks for complex UI components.\nRegression testing for outputs that rarely change structure.\nAssertion testing is ideal for:\nCore logic validation.\nComputed value testing.\nFine-grained tests requiring precise conditions.\n\nBy combining snapshot testing for broad, structural checks and assertion testing for specific functionality, you can achieve a well-rounded testing strategy.\n\nAria snapshots�\n\nIn Playwright, aria snapshots provide a YAML representation of the accessibility tree of a page. These snapshots can be stored and compared later to verify if the page structure remains consistent or meets defined expectations.\n\nThe YAML format describes the hierarchical structure of accessible elements on the page, detailing roles, attributes, values, and text content. The structure follows a tree-like syntax, where each node represents an accessible element, and indentation indicates nested elements.\n\nEach accessible element in the tree is represented as a YAML node:\n\n- role \"name\" [attribute=value]\n\nrole: Specifies the ARIA or HTML role of the element (e.g., heading, list, listitem, button).\n\"name\": Accessible name of the element. Quoted strings indicate exact values, /patterns/ are used for regular expression.\n[attribute=value]: Attributes and values, in square brackets, represent specific ARIA attributes, such as checked, disabled, expanded, level, pressed, or selected.\n\nThese values are derived from ARIA attributes or calculated based on HTML semantics. To inspect the accessibility tree structure of a page, use the Chrome DevTools Accessibility Tab.\n\nSnapshot matching�\n\nThe expect(locator).to_match_aria_snapshot() assertion method in Playwright compares the accessible structure of the locator scope with a predefined aria snapshot template, helping validate the page's state against testing requirements.\n\nFor the following DOM:\n\n<h1>title</h1>\n\n\nYou can match it using the following snapshot template:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.locator(\"body\")).to_match_aria_snapshot(\"\"\"\n  - heading \"title\"\n\"\"\")\n\n\nWhen matching, the snapshot template is compared to the current accessibility tree of the page:\n\nIf the tree structure matches the template, the test passes; otherwise, it fails, indicating a mismatch between expected and actual accessibility states.\nThe comparison is case-sensitive and collapses whitespace, so indentation and line breaks are ignored.\nThe comparison is order-sensitive, meaning the order of elements in the snapshot template must match the order in the page's accessibility tree.\nPartial matching�\n\nYou can perform partial matches on nodes by omitting attributes or accessible names, enabling verification of specific parts of the accessibility tree without requiring exact matches. This flexibility is helpful for dynamic or irrelevant attributes.\n\n<button>Submit</button>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- button\n\n\nIn this example, the button role is matched, but the accessible name (\"Submit\") is not specified, allowing the test to pass regardless of the button's label.\n\nFor elements with ARIA attributes like checked or disabled, omitting these attributes allows partial matching, focusing solely on role and hierarchy.\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked>\n\n\naria snapshot for partial match\n\n- checkbox\n\n\nIn this partial match, the checked attribute is ignored, so the test will pass regardless of the checkbox state.\n\nSimilarly, you can partially match children in lists or groups by omitting specific list items or nested elements.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Feature A</li>\n  <li>Feature B</li>\n  <li>Feature C</li>\n</ul>\n\n\naria snapshot for partial match\n\n- list\n  - listitem: Feature B\n\n\nPartial matches let you create flexible snapshot tests that verify essential page structure without enforcing specific content or attributes.\n\nStrict matching�\n\nBy default, a template containing the subset of children will be matched:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Feature A</li>\n  <li>Feature B</li>\n  <li>Feature C</li>\n</ul>\n\n\naria snapshot for partial match\n\n- list\n  - listitem: Feature B\n\n\nThe /children property can be used to control how child elements are matched:\n\ncontain (default): Matches if all specified children are present in order\nequal: Matches if the children exactly match the specified list in order\ndeep-equal: Matches if the children exactly match the specified list in order, including nested children\n<ul>\n  <li>Feature A</li>\n  <li>Feature B</li>\n  <li>Feature C</li>\n</ul>\n\n\naria snapshot will fail due to Feature C not being in the template\n\n- list\n  - /children: equal\n  - listitem: Feature A\n  - listitem: Feature B\n\nMatching with regular expressions�\n\nRegular expressions allow flexible matching for elements with dynamic or variable text. Accessible names and text can support regex patterns.\n\n<h1>Issues 12</h1>\n\n\naria snapshot with regular expression\n\n- heading /Issues \\d+/\n\nGenerating snapshots�\n\nCreating aria snapshots in Playwright helps ensure and maintain your application's structure. You can generate snapshots in various ways depending on your testing setup and workflow.\n\nGenerating snapshots with the Playwright code generator�\n\nIf you're using Playwright's Code Generator, generating aria snapshots is streamlined with its interactive interface:\n\n\"Assert snapshot\" Action: In the code generator, you can use the \"Assert snapshot\" action to automatically create a snapshot assertion for the selected elements. This is a quick way to capture the aria snapshot as part of your recorded test flow.\n\"Aria snapshot\" Tab: The \"Aria snapshot\" tab within the code generator interface visually represents the aria snapshot for a selected locator, letting you explore, inspect, and verify element roles, attributes, and accessible names to aid snapshot creation and review.\nUsing the Locator.ariaSnapshot method�\n\nThe locator.aria_snapshot() method allows you to programmatically create a YAML representation of accessible elements within a locator's scope, especially helpful for generating snapshots dynamically during test execution.\n\nExample:\n\nSync\nAsync\nsnapshot = page.locator(\"body\").aria_snapshot()\nprint(snapshot)\n\n\nThis command outputs the aria snapshot within the specified locator's scope in YAML format, which you can validate or store as needed.\n\nAccessibility tree examples�\nHeadings with level attributes�\n\nHeadings can include a level attribute indicating their heading level.\n\n<h1>Title</h1>\n<h2>Subtitle</h2>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- heading \"Title\" [level=1]\n- heading \"Subtitle\" [level=2]\n\nText nodes�\n\nStandalone or descriptive text elements appear as text nodes.\n\n<div>Sample accessible name</div>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- text: Sample accessible name\n\nInline multiline text�\n\nMultiline text, such as paragraphs, is normalized in the aria snapshot.\n\n<p>Line 1<br>Line 2</p>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- paragraph: Line 1 Line 2\n\nLinks�\n\nLinks display their text or composed content from pseudo-elements.\n\n<a href=\"#more-info\">Read more about Accessibility</a>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- link \"Read more about Accessibility\"\n\nText boxes�\n\nInput elements of type text show their value attribute content.\n\n<input type=\"text\" value=\"Enter your name\">\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- textbox: Enter your name\n\nLists with items�\n\nOrdered and unordered lists include their list items.\n\n<ul aria-label=\"Main Features\">\n  <li>Feature 1</li>\n  <li>Feature 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- list \"Main Features\":\n  - listitem: Feature 1\n  - listitem: Feature 2\n\nGrouped elements�\n\nGroups capture nested elements, such as <details> elements with summary content.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Summary</summary>\n  <p>Detail content here</p>\n</details>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- group: Summary\n\nAttributes and states�\n\nCommonly used ARIA attributes, like checked, disabled, expanded, level, pressed, and selected, represent control states.\n\nCheckbox with checked attribute�\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- checkbox [checked]\n\nButton with pressed attribute�\n<button aria-pressed=\"true\">Toggle</button>\n\n\naria snapshot\n\n- button \"Toggle\" [pressed=true]\n\nPrevious\nScreenshots\nNext\nTest generator\nOverview\nAssertion testing vs Snapshot testing\nAssertion testing\nSnapshot testing\nWhen to use\nAria snapshots\nSnapshot matching\nPartial matching\nStrict matching\nMatching with regular expressions\nGenerating snapshots\nGenerating snapshots with the Playwright code generator\nUsing the Locator.ariaSnapshot method\nAccessibility tree examples\nHeadings with level attributes\nText nodes\nInline multiline text\nLinks\nText boxes\nLists with items\nGrouped elements\nAttributes and states\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing role, text and test id locators. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient that uniquely identify the target element.\n\nGenerate tests with the Playwright Inspector�\n\nWhen running the codegen command two windows will be opened, a browser window where you interact with the website you wish to test and the Playwright Inspector window where you can record your tests and then copy them into your editor.\n\nRunning Codegen�\n\nUse the codegen command to run the test generator followed by the URL of the website you want to generate tests for. The URL is optional and you can always run the command without it and then add the URL directly into the browser window instead.\n\nplaywright codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc\n\nRecording a test�\n\nRun the codegen command and perform actions in the browser window. Playwright will generate the code for the user interactions which you can see in the Playwright Inspector window. Once you have finished recording your test stop the recording and press the copy button to copy your generated test into your editor.\n\nWith the test generator you can record:\n\nActions like click or fill by simply interacting with the page\nAssertions by clicking on one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. You can choose:\n'assert visibility' to assert that an element is visible\n'assert text' to assert that an element contains specific text\n'assert value' to assert that an element has a specific value\n\n�\n\nWhen you have finished interacting with the page, press the record button to stop the recording and use the copy button to copy the generated code to your editor.\n\nUse the clear button to clear the code to start recording again. Once finished, close the Playwright inspector window or stop the terminal command.\n\nGenerating locators�\n\nYou can generate locators with the test generator.\n\nPress the 'Record' button to stop the recording and the 'Pick Locator' button will appear.\nClick on the 'Pick Locator' button and then hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element.\nTo choose a locator, click on the element you would like to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the field next to the Pick Locator button.\nYou can then edit the locator in this field to fine tune it or use the copy button to copy it and paste it into your code.\n�\n\nEmulation�\n\nYou can use the test generator to generate tests using emulation so as to generate a test for a specific viewport, device, color scheme, as well as emulate the geolocation, language or timezone. The test generator can also generate a test while preserving authenticated state.\n\nEmulate viewport size�\n\nPlaywright opens a browser window with its viewport set to a specific width and height and is not responsive as tests need to be run under the same conditions. Use the --viewport option to generate tests with a different viewport size.\n\nplaywright codegen --viewport-size=\"800,600\" playwright.dev\n\n�\nEmulate devices�\n\nRecord scripts and tests while emulating a mobile device using the --device option which sets the viewport size and user agent among others.\n\nplaywright codegen --device=\"iPhone 13\" playwright.dev\n\n�\nEmulate color scheme�\n\nRecord scripts and tests while emulating the color scheme with the --color-scheme option.\n\nplaywright codegen --color-scheme=dark playwright.dev\n\n�\nEmulate geolocation, language and timezone�\n\nRecord scripts and tests while emulating timezone, language & location using the --timezone, --geolocation and --lang options. Once the page opens:\n\nAccept the cookies\nOn the top right, click on the locate me button to see geolocation in action.\nplaywright codegen --timezone=\"Europe/Rome\" --geolocation=\"41.890221,12.492348\" --lang=\"it-IT\" bing.com/maps\n\n�\nPreserve authenticated state�\n\nRun codegen with --save-storage to save cookies, localStorage and IndexedDB data at the end of the session. This is useful to separately record an authentication step and reuse it later when recording more tests.\n\nplaywright codegen github.com/microsoft/playwright --save-storage=auth.json\n\n�\nLogin�\n\nAfter performing authentication and closing the browser, auth.json will contain the storage state which you can then reuse in your tests.\n\nMake sure you only use the auth.json locally as it contains sensitive information. Add it to your .gitignore or delete it once you have finished generating your tests.\n\nLoad authenticated state�\n\nRun with --load-storage to consume the previously loaded storage from the auth.json. This way, all cookies, localStorage and IndexedDB data will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state without the need to login again. This means you can continue generating tests from the logged in state.\n\nplaywright codegen --load-storage=auth.json github.com/microsoft/playwright\n\n�\nUse existing userDataDir�\n\nRun codegen with --user-data-dir to set a fixed user data directory for the browser session. If you create a custom browser user data directory, codegen will use this existing browser profile and have access to any authentication state present in that profile.\n\nWARNING\n\nAs of Chrome 136, the default user data directory cannot be accessed via automated tooling, such as Playwright. You must create a separate user data directory for use in testing.\n\nplaywright codegen --user-data-dir=/path/to/your/browser/data/ github.com/microsoft/playwright\n\nRecord using custom setup�\n\nIf you would like to use codegen in some non-standard setup (for example, use browser_context.route()), it is possible to call page.pause() that will open a separate window with codegen controls.\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    # Make sure to run headed.\n    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)\n\n    # Setup context however you like.\n    context = browser.new_context() # Pass any options\n    context.route('**/*', lambda route: route.continue_())\n\n    # Pause the page, and start recording manually.\n    page = context.new_page()\n    page.pause()\n\nPrevious\nSnapshot testing\nNext\nTouch events (legacy)\nIntroduction\nGenerate tests with the Playwright Inspector\nRunning Codegen\nRecording a test\nGenerating locators\nEmulation\nEmulate viewport size\nEmulate devices\nEmulate color scheme\nEmulate geolocation, language and timezone\nPreserve authenticated state\nRecord using custom setup\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Traces are a great way for debugging your tests when they fail on CI. You can open traces locally or in your browser on trace.playwright.dev.\n\nOpening Trace Viewer�\n\nYou can open a saved trace using either the Playwright CLI or in the browser at trace.playwright.dev. Make sure to add the full path to where your trace.zip file is located.\n\nplaywright show-trace trace.zip\n\nUsing trace.playwright.dev�\n\ntrace.playwright.dev is a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. You can upload a trace file using drag and drop or via the Select file button.\n\nTrace Viewer loads the trace entirely in your browser and does not transmit any data externally.\n\nViewing remote traces�\n\nYou can open remote traces directly using its URL. This makes it easy to view the remote trace without having to manually download the file from CI runs, for example.\n\nplaywright show-trace https://example.com/trace.zip\n\n\nWhen using trace.playwright.dev, you can also pass the URL of your uploaded trace at some accessible storage (e.g. inside your CI) as a query parameter. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules might apply.\n\nhttps://trace.playwright.dev/?trace=https://demo.playwright.dev/reports/todomvc/data/e6099cadf79aa753d5500aa9508f9d1dbd87b5ee.zip\n\nRecording a trace�\n\nTraces can be recorded by running your tests with the --tracing flag.\n\npytest --tracing on\n\n\nOptions for tracing are:\n\non: Record trace for each test\noff: Do not record trace. (default)\nretain-on-failure: Record trace for each test, but remove all traces from successful test runs.\n\nThis will record the trace and place it into the file named trace.zip in your test-results directory.\n\nIf you are not using Pytest, click here to learn how to record traces.\nTrace Viewer features�\nActions�\n\nIn the Actions tab you can see what locator was used for every action and how long each one took to run. Hover over each action of your test and visually see the change in the DOM snapshot. Go back and forward in time and click an action to inspect and debug. Use the Before and After tabs to visually see what happened before and after the action.\n\nSelecting each action reveals:\n\nAction snapshots\nAction log\nSource code location\nScreenshots�\n\nWhen tracing with the screenshots option turned on (default), each trace records a screencast and renders it as a film strip. You can hover over the film strip to see a magnified image of for each action and state which helps you easily find the action you want to inspect.\n\nDouble click on an action to see the time range for that action. You can use the slider in the timeline to increase the actions selected and these will be shown in the Actions tab and all console logs and network logs will be filtered to only show the logs for the actions selected.\n\nSnapshots�\n\nWhen tracing with the snapshots option turned on (default), Playwright captures a set of complete DOM snapshots for each action. Depending on the type of the action, it will capture:\n\nType\tDescription\nBefore\tA snapshot at the time action is called.\nAction\tA snapshot at the moment of the performed input. This type of snapshot is especially useful when exploring where exactly Playwright clicked.\nAfter\tA snapshot after the action.\n\nHere is what the typical Action snapshot looks like:\n\nNotice how it highlights both, the DOM Node as well as the exact click position.\n\nSource�\n\nWhen you click on an action in the sidebar, the line of code for that action is highlighted in the source panel.\n\nCall�\n\nThe call tab shows you information about the action such as the time it took, what locator was used, if in strict mode and what key was used.\n\nLog�\n\nSee a full log of your test to better understand what Playwright is doing behind the scenes such as scrolling into view, waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable and performing actions such as click, fill, press etc.\n\nErrors�\n\nIf your test fails you will see the error messages for each test in the Errors tab. The timeline will also show a red line highlighting where the error occurred. You can also click on the source tab to see on which line of the source code the error is.\n\nConsole�\n\nSee console logs from the browser as well as from your test. Different icons are displayed to show you if the console log came from the browser or from the test file.\n\nDouble click on an action from your test in the actions sidebar. This will filter the console to only show the logs that were made during that action. Click the Show all button to see all console logs again.\n\nUse the timeline to filter actions, by clicking a start point and dragging to an ending point. The console tab will also be filtered to only show the logs that were made during the actions selected.\n\nNetwork�\n\nThe Network tab shows you all the network requests that were made during your test. You can sort by different types of requests, status code, method, request, content type, duration and size. Click on a request to see more information about it such as the request headers, response headers, request body and response body.\n\nDouble click on an action from your test in the actions sidebar. This will filter the network requests to only show the requests that were made during that action. Click the Show all button to see all network requests again.\n\nUse the timeline to filter actions, by clicking a start point and dragging to an ending point. The network tab will also be filtered to only show the network requests that were made during the actions selected.\n\nMetadata�\n\nNext to the Actions tab you will find the Metadata tab which will show you more information on your test such as the Browser, viewport size, test duration and more.\n\nPrevious\nTouch events (legacy)\nNext\nVideos\nIntroduction\nOpening Trace Viewer\nUsing trace.playwright.dev\nViewing remote traces\nRecording a trace\nTrace Viewer features\nActions\nScreenshots\nSnapshots\nSource\nCall\nLog\nErrors\nConsole\nNetwork\nMetadata\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

The examples below demonstrate how to use locator.dispatch_event() and pass Touch points as arguments.\n\nNote that locator.dispatch_event() does not set Event.isTrusted property. If your web page relies on it, make sure to disable isTrusted check during the test.\n\nEmulating pan gesture�\n\nIn the example below, we emulate pan gesture that is expected to move the map. The app under test only uses clientX/clientY coordinates of the touch point, so we initialize just that.

WebView2 is a WinForms control, which will use Microsoft Edge under the hood to render web content. It is a part of the Microsoft Edge browser and is available on Windows 10 and Windows 11. Playwright can be used to automate WebView2 applications and can be used to test web content in WebView2. For connecting to WebView2, Playwright uses browser_type.connect_over_cdp() which connects to it via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).\n\nOverview�\n\nA WebView2 control can be instructed to listen to incoming CDP connections by setting either the WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS environment variable with --remote-debugging-port=9222 or calling EnsureCoreWebView2Async with the --remote-debugging-port=9222 argument. This will start the WebView2 process with the Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled which allows the automation by Playwright. 9222 is an example port in this case, but any other unused port can be used as well.\n\nawait this.webView.EnsureCoreWebView2Async(await CoreWebView2Environment.CreateAsync(null, null, new CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions()\n{\n  AdditionalBrowserArguments = \"--remote-debugging-port=9222\",\n})).ConfigureAwait(false);\n\n\nOnce your application with the WebView2 control is running, you can connect to it via Playwright:\n\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(\"http://localhost:9222\")\ncontext = browser.contexts[0]\npage = context.pages[0]\n\n\nTo ensure that the WebView2 control is ready, you can wait for the CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted event:\n\nthis.webView.CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted += (_, e) =>\n{\n    if (e.IsSuccess)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"WebView2 initialized\");\n    }\n};\n\nWriting and running tests�\n\nBy default, the WebView2 control will use the same user data directory for all instances. This means that if you run multiple tests in parallel, they will interfere with each other. To avoid this, you should set the WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER environment variable (or use WebView2.EnsureCoreWebView2Async Method) to a different folder for each test. This will make sure that each test runs in its own user data directory.\n\nUsing the following, Playwright will run your WebView2 application as a sub-process, assign a unique user data directory to it and provide the Page instance to your test:\n\nconftest.py\nimport os\nimport socket\nimport tempfile\nimport pytest\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Playwright, Browser, BrowserContext\nimport subprocess\n\nEXECUTABLE_PATH = (\n    Path(__file__).parent\n    / \"..\"\n    / \"webview2-app\"\n    / \"bin\"\n    / \"Debug\"\n    / \"net8.0-windows\"\n    / \"webview2.exe\"\n)\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef data_dir():\n    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(\n        prefix=\"playwright-webview2-tests\", ignore_cleanup_errors=True\n    ) as tmpdirname:\n        yield tmpdirname\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef webview2_process_cdp_port(data_dir: str):\n    cdp_port = _find_free_port()\n    process = subprocess.Popen(\n        [EXECUTABLE_PATH],\n        env={\n            **dict(os.environ),\n            \"WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS\": f\"--remote-debugging-port={cdp_port}\",\n            \"WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER\": data_dir,\n        },\n        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,\n        universal_newlines=True,\n    )\n    while True:\n        line = process.stdout.readline()\n        if \"WebView2 initialized\" in line:\n            break\n    yield cdp_port\n    process.terminate()\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"session\")\ndef browser(playwright: Playwright, webview2_process_cdp_port: int):\n    browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(\n        f\"http://127.0.0.1:{webview2_process_cdp_port}\"\n    )\n    yield browser\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"function\")\ndef context(browser: Browser):\n    context = browser.contexts[0]\n    yield context\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"function\")\ndef page(context: BrowserContext):\n    page = context.pages[0]\n    yield page\n\n\ndef _find_free_port(port=9000, max_port=65535):\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n    while port <= max_port:\n        try:\n            sock.bind((\"\", port))\n            sock.close()\n            return port\n        except OSError:\n            port += 1\n    raise IOError(\"no free ports\")\n\ntest_webview2.py\nfrom playwright.sync_api import Page, expect\n\n\ndef test_webview2(page: Page):\n    page.goto(\"https://playwright.dev\")\n    get_started = page.get_by_text(\"Get Started\")\n    expect(get_started).to_be_visible()\n\nDebugging�\n\nInside your webview2 control, you can just right-click to open the context menu and select \"Inspect\" to open the DevTools or press F12.

This image includes the Playwright browsers and browser system dependencies. The Playwright package/dependency is not included in the image and should be installed separately.\n\nUsage�\n\nThis Docker image is published to Microsoft Artifact Registry.\n\nINFO\n\nThis Docker image is intended to be used for testing and development purposes only. It is not recommended to use this Docker image to visit untrusted websites.\n\nPull the image�\ndocker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble\n\nRun the image�\n\nBy default, the Docker image will use the root user to run the browsers. This will disable the Chromium sandbox which is not available with root. If you run trusted code (e.g. End-to-end tests) and want to avoid the hassle of managing separate user then the root user may be fine. For web scraping or crawling, we recommend to create a separate user inside the Docker container and use the seccomp profile.\n\nEnd-to-end tests�\n\nOn trusted websites, you can avoid creating a separate user and use root for it since you trust the code which will run on the browsers.\n\ndocker run -it --rm --ipc=host mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble /bin/bash\n\nCrawling and scraping�\n\nOn untrusted websites, it's recommended to use a separate user for launching the browsers in combination with the seccomp profile. Inside the container or if you are using the Docker image as a base image you have to use adduser for it.\n\ndocker run -it --rm --ipc=host --user pwuser --security-opt seccomp=seccomp_profile.json mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble /bin/bash\n\n\nseccomp_profile.json is needed to run Chromium with sandbox. This is a default Docker seccomp profile with extra user namespace cloning permissions:\n\n{\n  \"comment\": \"Allow create user namespaces\",\n  \"names\": [\n    \"clone\",\n    \"setns\",\n    \"unshare\"\n  ],\n  \"action\": \"SCMP_ACT_ALLOW\",\n  \"args\": [],\n  \"includes\": {},\n  \"excludes\": {}\n}\n\nRecommended Docker Configuration�\n\nWhen running Playwright in Docker, the following configuration is recommended:\n\nUsing --init Docker flag is recommended to avoid special treatment for processes with PID=1. This is a common reason for zombie processes.\nUsing --ipc=host is recommended when using Chromium. Without it, Chromium can run out of memory and crash. Learn more about this option in Docker docs.\nIf seeing weird errors when launching Chromium, try running your container with docker run --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN when developing locally.\nUsing on CI�\n\nSee our Continuous Integration guides for sample configs.\n\nRemote Connection�\n\nYou can run Playwright Server in Docker while keeping your tests running on the host system or another machine. This is useful for running tests on unsupported Linux distributions or remote execution scenarios.\n\nRunning the Playwright Server�\n\nStart the Playwright Server in Docker:\n\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 --rm --init -it --workdir /home/pwuser --user pwuser mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble /bin/sh -c \"npx -y playwright@1.57.0 run-server --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0\"\n\nConnecting to the Server�\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.connect(\"ws://127.0.0.1:3000/\")\n\nNetwork Configuration�\n\nIf you need to access local servers from within the Docker container:\n\ndocker run --add-host=hostmachine:host-gateway -p 3000:3000 --rm --init -it --workdir /home/pwuser --user pwuser mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble /bin/sh -c \"npx -y playwright@1.57.0 run-server --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0\"\n\n\nThis makes hostmachine point to the host's localhost. Your tests should use hostmachine instead of localhost when accessing local servers.\n\nNOTE\n\nWhen running tests remotely, ensure the Playwright version in your tests matches the version running in the Docker container.\n\nConnecting using noVNC and GitHub Codespaces�\n\nFor Docker and GitHub Codespaces environments, you can view and generate tests using the noVNC viewer built into the Docker image. In order for the VNC webviewer to be accessible outside of the container, you can enable the desktop-lite feature and specify the webPort in your .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file:\n\n{\n  \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0\",\n  \"forwardPorts\": [6080],\n  \"features\": {\n    \"desktop-lite\": {\n      \"webPort\": \"6080\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nOnce this is enabled you can open the port specified in a new browser tab and you will have access to the noVNC web viewer. This will enable you to record tests, pick selectors, and use codegen directly on your container.\n\nImage tags�\n\nSee all available image tags.\n\nWe currently publish images with the following tags:\n\n:v1.57.0 - Playwright v1.57.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).\n:v1.57.0-noble - Playwright v1.57.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).\n:v1.57.0-jammy - Playwright v1.57.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).\nNOTE\n\nIt is recommended to always pin your Docker image to a specific version if possible. If the Playwright version in your Docker image does not match the version in your project/tests, Playwright will be unable to locate browser executables.\n\nBase images�\n\nWe currently publish images based on the following Ubuntu versions:\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat), image tags include noble\nUbuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish), image tags include jammy\nAlpine�\n\nBrowser builds for Firefox and WebKit are built for the glibc library. Alpine Linux and other distributions that are based on the musl standard library are not supported.\n\nBuild your own image�\n\nTo run Playwright inside Docker, you need to have Python, Playwright browsers and browser system dependencies installed. See the following Dockerfile:\n\nFROM python:3.12-bookworm\n\nRUN pip install playwright==@1.57.0 && \\\n    playwright install --with-deps\n\nPrevious\nWebView2\nNext\nContinuous Integration\nIntroduction\nUsage\nPull the image\nRun the image\nRecommended Docker Configuration\nUsing on CI\nRemote Connection\nConnecting using noVNC and GitHub Codespaces\nImage tags\nBase images\nBuild your own image\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Note this feature is experimental and is prioritized accordingly.\n\nWARNING\n\nThere is a risk of Playwright integration with Selenium Grid Hub breaking in the future. Make sure you weight risks against benefits before using it.\n\nMORE DETAILS\n\nBefore connecting Playwright to your Selenium Grid, make sure that grid works with Selenium WebDriver. For example, run one of the examples and pass SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL environment variable. If webdriver example does not work, look for any errors at your Selenium hub/node/standalone output and search Selenium issues for a possible solution.\n\nStarting Selenium Grid�\n\nIf you run distributed Selenium Grid, Playwright needs selenium nodes to be registered with an accessible address, so that it could connect to the browsers. To make sure it works as expected, set SE_NODE_GRID_URL environment variable pointing to the hub when running selenium nodes.\n\n# Start selenium node\nSE_NODE_GRID_URL=\"http://<selenium-hub-ip>:4444\" java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node\n\nConnecting Playwright to Selenium Grid�\n\nTo connect Playwright to Selenium Grid 4, set SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL environment variable pointing to your Selenium Grid Hub. Note that this only works for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\n\nSELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://<selenium-hub-ip>:4444 pytest --browser chromium\n\n\nYou don't have to change your code, just use your testing harness or browser_type.launch() as usual.\n\nPassing additional capabilities�\n\nIf your grid requires additional capabilities to be set (for example, you use an external service), you can set SELENIUM_REMOTE_CAPABILITIES environment variable to provide JSON-serialized capabilities.\n\nSELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://<selenium-hub-ip>:4444 SELENIUM_REMOTE_CAPABILITIES=\"{'mygrid:options':{os:'windows',username:'John',password:'secure'}}\" pytest --browser chromium\n\nPassing additional headers�\n\nIf your grid requires additional headers to be set (for example, you should provide authorization token to use browsers in your cloud), you can set SELENIUM_REMOTE_HEADERS environment variable to provide JSON-serialized headers.\n\nSELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://<selenium-hub-ip>:4444 SELENIUM_REMOTE_HEADERS=\"{'Authorization':'Basic b64enc'}\" pytest --browser chromium\n\nDetailed logs�\n\nRun with DEBUG=pw:browser* environment variable to see how Playwright is connecting to Selenium Grid.\n\nDEBUG=pw:browser* SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://internal.grid:4444 pytest --browser chromium\n\n\nIf you file an issue, please include this log.\n\nUsing Selenium Docker�\n\nOne easy way to use Selenium Grid is to run official docker containers. Read more in selenium docker images documentation. For image tagging convention, read more.\n\nStandalone mode�\n\nHere is an example of running selenium standalone and connecting Playwright to it. Note that hub and node are on the same localhost, and we pass SE_NODE_GRID_URL environment variable pointing to it.\n\nFirst start Selenium.\n\ndocker run -d -p 4444:4444 --shm-size=\"2g\" -e SE_NODE_GRID_URL=\"http://localhost:4444\" selenium/standalone-chromium:latest\n\n\nThen run Playwright.\n\nSELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://localhost:4444 pytest --browser chromium\n\nHub and nodes mode�\n\nHere is an example of running selenium hub and a single selenium node, and connecting Playwright to the hub. Note that hub and node have different IPs, and we pass SE_NODE_GRID_URL environment variable pointing to the hub when starting node containers.\n\nFirst start the hub container and one or more node containers.\n\ndocker run -d -p 4442-4444:4442-4444 --name selenium-hub selenium/hub:4.25.0\ndocker run -d -p 5555:5555 \\\n    --shm-size=\"2g\" \\\n    -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=<selenium-hub-ip> \\\n    -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 \\\n    -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 \\\n    -e SE_NODE_GRID_URL=\"http://<selenium-hub-ip>:4444\"\n    selenium/node-chromium:4.25.0\n\n\nThen run Playwright.\n\nSELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://<selenium-hub-ip>:4444 pytest --browser chromium\n\nSelenium 3�\n\nInternally, Playwright connects to the browser using Chrome DevTools Protocol websocket. Selenium 4 exposes this capability, while Selenium 3 does not.\n\nThis means that Selenium 3 is supported in a best-effort manner, where Playwright tries to connect to the grid node directly. Grid nodes must be directly accessible from the machine that runs Playwright.\n\nPrevious\nContinuous Integration\nNext\nSupported languages\nIntroduction\nStarting Selenium Grid\nConnecting Playwright to Selenium Grid\nPassing additional capabilities\nPassing additional headers\nDetailed logs\nUsing Selenium Docker\nStandalone mode\nHub and nodes mode\nSelenium 3\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

We have created sample configurations for common CI providers.\n\n3 steps to get your tests running on CI:\n\nEnsure CI agent can run browsers: Use our Docker image in Linux agents or install your dependencies using the CLI.\n\nInstall Playwright:\n\npip install playwright\nplaywright install --with-deps\n\n\nRun your tests:\n\npytest\n\nCI configurations�\n\nThe Command line tools can be used to install all operating system dependencies in CI.\n\nGitHub Actions�\nOn push/pull_request�\n\nTests will run on push or pull request on branches main/master. The workflow will install all dependencies, install Playwright and then run the tests.\n\n.github/workflows/playwright.yml\nname: Playwright Tests\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main, master ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main, master ]\njobs:\n  test:\n    timeout-minutes: 60\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v5\n    - name: Set up Python\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v6\n      with:\n        python-version: '3.13'\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n    - name: Ensure browsers are installed\n      run: python -m playwright install --with-deps\n    - name: Run your tests\n      run: pytest --tracing=retain-on-failure\n    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v5\n      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}\n      with:\n        name: playwright-traces\n        path: test-results/\n\nVia Containers�\n\nGitHub Actions support running jobs in a container by using the jobs.<job_id>.container option. This is useful to not pollute the host environment with dependencies and to have a consistent environment for e.g. screenshots/visual regression testing across different operating systems.\n\n.github/workflows/playwright.yml\nname: Playwright Tests\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main, master ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main, master ]\njobs:\n  playwright:\n    name: 'Playwright Tests'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container:\n      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble\n      options: --user 1001\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v5\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v6\n        with:\n          python-version: '3.13'\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: |\n          python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n          pip install -r local-requirements.txt\n          pip install -e .\n      - name: Run your tests\n        run: pytest\n\nOn deployment�\n\nThis will start the tests after a GitHub Deployment went into the success state. Services like Vercel use this pattern so you can run your end-to-end tests on their deployed environment.\n\n.github/workflows/playwright.yml\nname: Playwright Tests\non:\n  deployment_status:\njobs:\n  test:\n    timeout-minutes: 60\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v5\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v6\n      with:\n        python-version: '3.13'\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n    - name: Ensure browsers are installed\n      run: python -m playwright install --with-deps\n    - name: Run tests\n      run: pytest\n      env:\n        # This might depend on your test-runner\n        PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}\n\nDocker�\n\nWe have a pre-built Docker image which can either be used directly or as a reference to update your existing Docker definitions. Make sure to follow the Recommended Docker Configuration to ensure the best performance.\n\nAzure Pipelines�\n\nFor Windows or macOS agents, no additional configuration is required, just install Playwright and run your tests.\n\nFor Linux agents, you can use our Docker container with Azure Pipelines support running containerized jobs. Alternatively, you can use Command line tools to install all necessary dependencies.\n\nFor running the Playwright tests use this pipeline task:\n\ntrigger:\n- main\n\npool:\n  vmImage: ubuntu-latest\n\nsteps:\n- task: UsePythonVersion@0\n  inputs:\n    versionSpec: '3.13'\n  displayName: 'Use Python'\n- script: |\n    python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n  displayName: 'Install dependencies'\n- script: playwright install --with-deps\n  displayName: 'Install Playwright browsers'\n- script: pytest\n  displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'\n\nAzure Pipelines (containerized)�\ntrigger:\n- main\n\npool:\n  vmImage: ubuntu-latest\ncontainer: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble\n\nsteps:\n- task: UsePythonVersion@0\n  inputs:\n    versionSpec: '3.13'\n  displayName: 'Use Python'\n\n- script: |\n    python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n  displayName: 'Install dependencies'\n- script: pytest\n  displayName: 'Run tests'\n\nCircleCI�\n\nRunning Playwright on CircleCI is very similar to running on GitHub Actions. In order to specify the pre-built Playwright Docker image, simply modify the agent definition with docker: in your config like so:\n\nexecutors:\n  pw-noble-development:\n    docker:\n      - image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble\n\n\nNote: When using the docker agent definition, you are specifying the resource class of where playwright runs to the 'medium' tier here. The default behavior of Playwright is to set the number of workers to the detected core count (2 in the case of the medium tier). Overriding the number of workers to greater than this number will cause unnecessary timeouts and failures.\n\nJenkins�\n\nJenkins supports Docker agents for pipelines. Use the Playwright Docker image to run tests on Jenkins.\n\npipeline {\n   agent { docker { image 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble' } }\n   stages {\n      stage('e2e-tests') {\n         steps {\n            sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'\n            sh 'pytest'\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nBitbucket Pipelines�\n\nBitbucket Pipelines can use public Docker images as build environments. To run Playwright tests on Bitbucket, use our public Docker image (see Dockerfile).\n\nimage: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble\n\nGitLab CI�\n\nTo run Playwright tests on GitLab, use our public Docker image (see Dockerfile).\n\nstages:\n  - test\n\ntests:\n  stage: test\n  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble\n  script:\n  ...\n\nCaching browsers�\n\nCaching browser binaries is not recommended, since the amount of time it takes to restore the cache is comparable to the time it takes to download the binaries. Especially under Linux, operating system dependencies need to be installed, which are not cacheable.\n\nIf you still want to cache the browser binaries between CI runs, cache these directories in your CI configuration, against a hash of the Playwright version.\n\nDebugging browser launches�\n\nPlaywright supports the DEBUG environment variable to output debug logs during execution. Setting it to pw:browser is helpful while debugging Error: Failed to launch browser errors.\n\nDEBUG=pw:browser pytest\n\nRunning headed�\n\nBy default, Playwright launches browsers in headless mode. See in our Running tests guide how to run tests in headed mode.\n\nOn Linux agents, headed execution requires Xvfb to be installed. Our Docker image and GitHub Action have Xvfb pre-installed. To run browsers in headed mode with Xvfb, add xvfb-run before the actual command.\n\nxvfb-run pytest\n\nPrevious\nDocker\nNext\nSelenium Grid (experimental)\nIntroduction\nCI configurations\nGitHub Actions\nDocker\nAzure Pipelines\nCircleCI\nJenkins\nBitbucket Pipelines\nGitLab CI\nCaching browsers\nDebugging browser launches\nRunning headed\nLearn\nGetting started\nPlaywright Training\nLearn Videos\nFeature Videos\nCommunity\nStack Overflow\nDiscord\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nMore\nGitHub\nYouTube\nBlog\nAmbassadors\nCopyright © 2026 Microsoft"

Examples:\n\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000 and sending request to /bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/bar.html\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000/foo/ and sending request to ./bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/foo/bar.html\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000/foo (without trailing slash) and navigating to ./bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/bar.html\n\nclient_certificates List[Dict] (optional) Added in: 1.46#\n\norigin str\n\nExact origin that the certificate is valid for. Origin includes https protocol, a hostname and optionally a port.\n\ncertPath Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)\n\nPath to the file with the certificate in PEM format.\n\ncert bytes (optional)\n\nDirect value of the certificate in PEM format.\n\nkeyPath Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)\n\nPath to the file with the private key in PEM format.\n\nkey bytes (optional)\n\nDirect value of the private key in PEM format.\n\npfxPath Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)\n\nPath to the PFX or PKCS12 encoded private key and certificate chain.\n\npfx bytes (optional)\n\nDirect value of the PFX or PKCS12 encoded private key and certificate chain.\n\npassphrase str (optional)\n\nPassphrase for the private key (PEM or PFX).\n\nTLS Client Authentication allows the server to request a client certificate and verify it.\n\nDetails\n\nAn array of client certificates to be used. Each certificate object must have either both certPath and keyPath, a single pfxPath, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (cert and key, or pfx). Optionally, passphrase property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The origin property should be provided with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.\n\nClient certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an origin that does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.\n\nNOTE\n\nWhen using WebKit on macOS, accessing localhost will not pick up client certificates. You can make it work by replacing localhost with local.playwright.\n\nextra_http_headers Dict[str, str] (optional)#\n\nAn object containing additional HTTP headers to be sent with every request.

You can use it to trigger API endpoints, configure micro-services, prepare environment or the service to your e2e test.\n\nEach Playwright browser context has associated with it APIRequestContext instance which shares cookie storage with the browser context and can be accessed via browser_context.request or page.request. It is also possible to create a new APIRequestContext instance manually by calling api_request.new_context().\n\nCookie management\n\nAPIRequestContext returned by browser_context.request and page.request shares cookie storage with the corresponding BrowserContext. Each API request will have Cookie header populated with the values from the browser context. If the API response contains Set-Cookie header it will automatically update BrowserContext cookies and requests made from the page will pick them up. This means that if you log in using this API, your e2e test will be logged in and vice versa.\n\nIf you want API requests to not interfere with the browser cookies you should create a new APIRequestContext by calling api_request.new_context(). Such APIRequestContext object will have its own isolated cookie storage.\n\nSync\nAsync\nimport os\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nREPO = \"test-repo-1\"\nUSER = \"github-username\"\nAPI_TOKEN = os.getenv(\"GITHUB_API_TOKEN\")\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    # This will launch a new browser, create a context and page.

An example of using a Browser to create a Page:\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright\n\ndef run(playwright: Playwright):\n    firefox = playwright.firefox\n    browser = firefox.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n    browser.close()\n\nwith sync_playwright() as playwright:\n    run(playwright)\n\nMethods�\nclose�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nIn case this browser is obtained using browser_type.launch(), closes the browser and all of its pages (if any were opened).\n\nIn case this browser is connected to, clears all created contexts belonging to this browser and disconnects from the browser server.\n\nNOTE\n\nThis is similar to force-quitting the browser. To close pages gracefully and ensure you receive page close events, call browser_context.close() on any BrowserContext instances you explicitly created earlier using browser.new_context() before calling browser.close().\n\nThe Browser object itself is considered to be disposed and cannot be used anymore.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser.close()\nbrowser.close(**kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nreason str (optional) Added in: v1.40#\n\nThe reason to be reported to the operations interrupted by the browser closure.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nnew_browser_cdp_session�\nAdded in: v1.11 \nNOTE\n\nCDP Sessions are only supported on Chromium-based browsers.\n\nReturns the newly created browser session.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser.new_browser_cdp_session()\n\n\nReturns\n\nCDPSession#\nnew_context�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nCreates a new browser context. It won't share cookies/cache with other browser contexts.\n\nNOTE\n\nIf directly using this method to create BrowserContexts, it is best practice to explicitly close the returned context via browser_context.close() when your code is done with the BrowserContext, and before calling browser.close(). This will ensure the context is closed gracefully and any artifacts—like HARs and videos—are fully flushed and saved.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser = playwright.firefox.launch() # or \"chromium\" or \"webkit\".\n# create a new incognito browser context.\ncontext = browser.new_context()\n# create a new page in a pristine context.\npage = context.new_page()\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n\n# gracefully close up everything\ncontext.close()\nbrowser.close()\n\n\nArguments\n\naccept_downloads bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to automatically download all the attachments. Defaults to true where all the downloads are accepted.\n\nbase_url str (optional)#\n\nWhen using page.goto(), page.route(), page.wait_for_url(), page.expect_request(), or page.expect_response() it takes the base URL in consideration by using the URL() constructor for building the corresponding URL. Unset by default. Examples:\n\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000 and navigating to /bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/bar.html\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000/foo/ and navigating to ./bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/foo/bar.html\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000/foo (without trailing slash) and navigating to ./bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/bar.html\n\nbypass_csp bool (optional)#\n\nToggles bypassing page's Content-Security-Policy.

Each certificate object must have either both certPath and keyPath, a single pfxPath, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (cert and key, or pfx). Optionally, passphrase property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The origin property should be provided with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.\n\nClient certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an origin that does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.\n\nNOTE\n\nWhen using WebKit on macOS, accessing localhost will not pick up client certificates.

Any permission may stop working after an update.\n\nHere are some permissions that may be supported by some browsers:\n\n'accelerometer'\n'ambient-light-sensor'\n'background-sync'\n'camera'\n'clipboard-read'\n'clipboard-write'\n'geolocation'\n'gyroscope'\n'local-fonts'\n'local-network-access'\n'magnetometer'\n'microphone'\n'midi-sysex' (system-exclusive midi)\n'midi'\n'notifications'\n'payment-handler'\n'storage-access'\n\norigin str (optional)#\n\nThe origin to grant permissions to, e.g. \"https://example.com\".\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nnew_cdp_session�\nAdded in: v1.11 \nNOTE\n\nCDP sessions are only supported on Chromium-based browsers.\n\nReturns the newly created session.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.new_cdp_session(page)\n\n\nArguments\n\npage Page | Frame#\n\nTarget to create new session for. For backwards-compatibility, this parameter is named page, but it can be a Page or Frame type.\n\nReturns\n\nCDPSession#\nnew_page�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nCreates a new page in the browser context.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.new_page()\n\n\nReturns\n\nPage#\nroute�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nRouting provides the capability to modify network requests that are made by any page in the browser context. Once route is enabled, every request matching the url pattern will stall unless it's continued, fulfilled or aborted.\n\nNOTE\n\nbrowser_context.route() will not intercept requests intercepted by Service Worker. See this issue. We recommend disabling Service Workers when using request interception by setting service_workers to 'block'.\n\nUsage\n\nAn example of a naive handler that aborts all image requests:\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext = browser.new_context()\npage = context.new_page()\ncontext.route(\"**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}\", lambda route: route.abort())\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\nbrowser.close()\n\n\nor the same snippet using a regex pattern instead:\n\nSync\nAsync\ncontext = browser.new_context()\npage = context.new_page()\ncontext.route(re.compile(r\"(\\.png$)|(\\.jpg$)\"), lambda route: route.abort())\npage = await context.new_page()\npage = context.new_page()\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\nbrowser.close()\n\n\nIt is possible to examine the request to decide the route action. For example, mocking all requests that contain some post data, and leaving all other requests as is:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef handle_route(route: Route):\n  if (\"my-string\" in route.request.post_data):\n    route.fulfill(body=\"mocked-data\")\n  else:\n    route.continue_()\ncontext.route(\"/api/**\", handle_route)\n\n\nPage routes (set up with page.route()) take precedence over browser context routes when request matches both handlers.\n\nTo remove a route with its handler you can use browser_context.unroute().\n\nNOTE\n\nEnabling routing disables http cache.\n\nArguments\n\nurl str | Pattern | Callable[URL]:bool#\n\nA glob pattern, regex pattern, or predicate that receives a URL to match during routing. If base_url is set in the context options and the provided URL is a string that does not start with *, it is resolved using the new URL() constructor.\n\nhandler Callable[Route, Request]:Promise[Any] | Any#\n\nhandler function to route the request.\n\ntimes int (optional) Added in: v1.15#\n\nHow often a route should be used. By default it will be used every time.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nroute_from_har�\nAdded in: v1.23 \n\nIf specified the network requests that are made in the context will be served from the HAR file. Read more about Replaying from HAR.\n\nPlaywright will not serve requests intercepted by Service Worker from the HAR file. See this issue. We recommend disabling Service Workers when using request interception by setting service_workers to 'block'.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.route_from_har(har)\nbrowser_context.route_from_har(har, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nhar Union[str, pathlib.Path]#\n\nPath to a HAR file with prerecorded network data. If path is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory.\n\nnot_found \"abort\" | \"fallback\" (optional)#\n\nIf set to 'abort' any request not found in the HAR file will be aborted.\nIf set to 'fallback' falls through to the next route handler in the handler chain.\n\nDefaults to abort.\n\nupdate bool (optional)#\n\nIf specified, updates the given HAR with the actual network information instead of serving from file. The file is written to disk when browser_context.close() is called.\n\nupdate_content \"embed\" | \"attach\" (optional) Added in: v1.32#\n\nOptional setting to control resource content management. If attach is specified, resources are persisted as separate files or entries in the ZIP archive. If embed is specified, content is stored inline the HAR file.\n\nupdate_mode \"full\" | \"minimal\" (optional) Added in: v1.32#\n\nWhen set to minimal, only record information necessary for routing from HAR. This omits sizes, timing, page, cookies, security and other types of HAR information that are not used when replaying from HAR. Defaults to minimal.\n\nurl str | Pattern (optional)#\n\nA glob pattern, regular expression or predicate to match the request URL. Only requests with URL matching the pattern will be served from the HAR file. If not specified, all requests are served from the HAR file.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nroute_web_socket�\nAdded in: v1.48 \n\nThis method allows to modify websocket connections that are made by any page in the browser context.\n\nNote that only WebSockets created after this method was called will be routed. It is recommended to call this method before creating any pages.\n\nUsage\n\nBelow is an example of a simple handler that blocks some websocket messages. See WebSocketRoute for more details and examples.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef message_handler(ws: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  if message == \"to-be-blocked\":\n    return\n  ws.send(message)\n\ndef handler(ws: WebSocketRoute):\n  ws.route_send(lambda message: message_handler(ws, message))\n  ws.connect()\n\ncontext.route_web_socket(\"/ws\", handler)\n\n\nArguments\n\nurl str | Pattern | Callable[URL]:bool#\n\nOnly WebSockets with the url matching this pattern will be routed. A string pattern can be relative to the base_url context option.\n\nhandler Callable[WebSocketRoute]:Promise[Any] | Any#\n\nHandler function to route the WebSocket.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nset_default_navigation_timeout�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nThis setting will change the default maximum navigation time for the following methods and related shortcuts:\n\npage.go_back()\npage.go_forward()\npage.goto()\npage.reload()\npage.set_content()\npage.expect_navigation()\nNOTE\n\npage.set_default_navigation_timeout() and page.set_default_timeout() take priority over browser_context.set_default_navigation_timeout().\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.set_default_navigation_timeout(timeout)\n\n\nArguments\n\ntimeout float#\n\nMaximum navigation time in milliseconds\n\nset_default_timeout�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nThis setting will change the default maximum time for all the methods accepting timeout option.\n\nNOTE\n\npage.set_default_navigation_timeout(), page.set_default_timeout() and browser_context.set_default_navigation_timeout() take priority over browser_context.set_default_timeout().\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.set_default_timeout(timeout)\n\n\nArguments\n\ntimeout float#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Pass 0 to disable timeout.\n\nset_extra_http_headers�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nThe extra HTTP headers will be sent with every request initiated by any page in the context. These headers are merged with page-specific extra HTTP headers set with page.set_extra_http_headers(). If page overrides a particular header, page-specific header value will be used instead of the browser context header value.\n\nNOTE\n\nbrowser_context.set_extra_http_headers() does not guarantee the order of headers in the outgoing requests.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.set_extra_http_headers(headers)\n\n\nArguments\n\nheaders Dict[str, str]#\n\nAn object containing additional HTTP headers to be sent with every request.

Requests made with this API will use context cookies.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.request\n\n\nType\n\nAPIRequestContext\nservice_workers�\nAdded in: v1.11 \nNOTE\n\nService workers are only supported on Chromium-based browsers.\n\nAll existing service workers in the context.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.service_workers\n\n\nReturns\n\nList[Worker]#\ntracing�\nAdded in: v1.12 \n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.tracing\n\n\nType\n\nTracing\nEvents�\non(\"close\")�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nEmitted when Browser context gets closed. This might happen because of one of the following:\n\nBrowser context is closed.\nBrowser application is closed or crashed.\nThe browser.close() method was called.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.on(\"close\", handler)\n\n\nEvent data\n\nBrowserContext\non(\"console\")�\nAdded in: v1.34 \n\nEmitted when JavaScript within the page calls one of console API methods, e.g. console.log or console.dir.\n\nThe arguments passed into console.log and the page are available on the ConsoleMessage event handler argument.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef print_args(msg):\n    for arg in msg.args:\n        print(arg.json_value())\n\ncontext.on(\"console\", print_args)\npage.evaluate(\"console.log('hello', 5, { foo: 'bar' })\")\n\n\nEvent data\n\nConsoleMessage\non(\"dialog\")�\nAdded in: v1.34 \n\nEmitted when a JavaScript dialog appears, such as alert, prompt, confirm or beforeunload. Listener must either dialog.accept() or dialog.dismiss() the dialog - otherwise the page will freeze waiting for the dialog, and actions like click will never finish.\n\nUsage\n\ncontext.on(\"dialog\", lambda dialog: dialog.accept())\n\nNOTE\n\nWhen no page.on(\"dialog\") or browser_context.on(\"dialog\") listeners are present, all dialogs are automatically dismissed.\n\nEvent data\n\nDialog\non(\"page\")�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nThe event is emitted when a new Page is created in the BrowserContext. The page may still be loading. The event will also fire for popup pages. See also page.on(\"popup\") to receive events about popups relevant to a specific page.\n\nThe earliest moment that page is available is when it has navigated to the initial url. For example, when opening a popup with window.open('http://example.com'), this event will fire when the network request to \"http://example.com\" is done and its response has started loading in the popup. If you would like to route/listen to this network request, use browser_context.route() and browser_context.on(\"request\") respectively instead of similar methods on the Page.\n\nSync\nAsync\nwith context.expect_page() as page_info:\n    page.get_by_text(\"open new page\").click(),\npage = page_info.value\nprint(page.evaluate(\"location.href\"))\n\nNOTE\n\nUse page.wait_for_load_state() to wait until the page gets to a particular state (you should not need it in most cases).\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_context.on(\"page\", handler)\n\n\nEvent data\n\nPage\non(\"request\")�\nAdded in: v1.12 \n\nEmitted when a request is issued from any pages created through this context.

The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright\n\ndef run(playwright: Playwright):\n    chromium = playwright.chromium\n    browser = chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n    # other actions...\n    browser.close()\n\nwith sync_playwright() as playwright:\n    run(playwright)\n\nMethods�\nconnect�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nThis method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance created via BrowserType.launchServer in Node.js.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe major and minor version of the Playwright instance that connects needs to match the version of Playwright that launches the browser (1.2.3 → is compatible with 1.2.x).\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_type.connect(ws_endpoint)\nbrowser_type.connect(ws_endpoint, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nws_endpoint str Added in: v1.10#\n\nA Playwright browser websocket endpoint to connect to. You obtain this endpoint via BrowserServer.wsEndpoint.\n\nexpose_network str (optional) Added in: v1.37#\n\nThis option exposes network available on the connecting client to the browser being connected to. Consists of a list of rules separated by comma.\n\nAvailable rules:\n\nHostname pattern, for example: example.com, *.org:99, x.*.y.com, *foo.org.\nIP literal, for example: 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0:99, [::1], [0:0::1]:99.\n<loopback> that matches local loopback interfaces: localhost, *.localhost, 127.0.0.1, [::1].\n\nSome common examples:\n\n\"*\" to expose all network.\n\"<loopback>\" to expose localhost network.\n\"*.test.internal-domain,*.staging.internal-domain,<loopback>\" to expose test/staging deployments and localhost.\n\nheaders Dict[str, str] (optional) Added in: v1.11#\n\nAdditional HTTP headers to be sent with web socket connect request. Optional.\n\nslow_mo float (optional) Added in: v1.10#\n\nSlows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.\n\ntimeout float (optional) Added in: v1.10#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to 0 (no timeout).\n\nReturns\n\nBrowser#\nconnect_over_cdp�\nAdded in: v1.9 \n\nThis method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance using the Chrome DevTools Protocol.\n\nThe default browser context is accessible via browser.contexts.\n\nNOTE\n\nConnecting over the Chrome DevTools Protocol is only supported for Chromium-based browsers.\n\nNOTE\n\nThis connection is significantly lower fidelity than the Playwright protocol connection via browser_type.connect(). If you are experiencing issues or attempting to use advanced functionality, you probably want to use browser_type.connect().\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(\"http://localhost:9222\")\ndefault_context = browser.contexts[0]\npage = default_context.pages[0]\n\n\nArguments\n\nendpoint_url str Added in: v1.11#\n\nA CDP websocket endpoint or http url to connect to. For example http://localhost:9222/ or ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/387adf4c-243f-4051-a181-46798f4a46f4.\n\nheaders Dict[str, str] (optional) Added in: v1.11#\n\nAdditional HTTP headers to be sent with connect request. Optional.\n\nis_local bool (optional) Added in: v1.58#\n\nTells Playwright that it runs on the same host as the CDP server. It will enable certain optimizations that rely upon the file system being the same between Playwright and the Browser.\n\nslow_mo float (optional) Added in: v1.11#\n\nSlows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.\n\ntimeout float (optional) Added in: v1.11#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout.\n\nReturns\n\nBrowser#\nlaunch�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nReturns the browser instance.\n\nUsage\n\nYou can use ignore_default_args to filter out --mute-audio from default arguments:\n\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser = playwright.chromium.launch( # or \"firefox\" or \"webkit\".\n    ignore_default_args=[\"--mute-audio\"]\n)\n\n\nChromium-only Playwright can also be used to control the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers, but it works best with the version of Chromium it is bundled with. There is no guarantee it will work with any other version. Use executable_path option with extreme caution.\n\nIf Google Chrome (rather than Chromium) is preferred, a Chrome Canary or Dev Channel build is suggested.\n\nStock browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are suitable for tests that require proprietary media codecs for video playback. See this article for other differences between Chromium and Chrome. This article describes some differences for Linux users.\n\nArguments\n\nargs List[str] (optional)#\n\nWARNING\n\nUse custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.\n\nAdditional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found here.\n\nchannel str (optional)#\n\nBrowser distribution channel.\n\nUse \"chromium\" to opt in to new headless mode.\n\nUse \"chrome\", \"chrome-beta\", \"chrome-dev\", \"chrome-canary\", \"msedge\", \"msedge-beta\", \"msedge-dev\", or \"msedge-canary\" to use branded Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\n\nchromium_sandbox bool (optional)#\n\nEnable Chromium sandboxing. Defaults to false.\n\ndownloads_path Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)#\n\nIf specified, accepted downloads are downloaded into this directory. Otherwise, temporary directory is created and is deleted when browser is closed. In either case, the downloads are deleted when the browser context they were created in is closed.\n\nenv Dict[str, str | float | bool] (optional)#\n\nSpecify environment variables that will be visible to the browser. Defaults to process.env.\n\nexecutable_path Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)#\n\nPath to a browser executable to run instead of the bundled one. If executable_path is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. Note that Playwright only works with the bundled Chromium, Firefox or WebKit, use at your own risk.\n\nfirefox_user_prefs Dict[str, str | float | bool] (optional)#\n\nFirefox user preferences. Learn more about the Firefox user preferences at about:config.\n\nYou can also provide a path to a custom policies.json file via PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_POLICIES_JSON environment variable.\n\nhandle_sighup bool (optional)#\n\nClose the browser process on SIGHUP.

Useful so that you can see what is going on.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the browser instance to start. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout.\n\ntraces_dir Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)#\n\nIf specified, traces are saved into this directory.\n\nReturns\n\nBrowser#\nlaunch_persistent_context�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nReturns the persistent browser context instance.\n\nLaunches browser that uses persistent storage located at user_data_dir and returns the only context. Closing this context will automatically close the browser.\n\nUsage\n\nbrowser_type.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir)\nbrowser_type.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nuser_data_dir Union[str, pathlib.Path]#\n\nPath to a User Data Directory, which stores browser session data like cookies and local storage. Pass an empty string to create a temporary directory.\n\nMore details for Chromium and Firefox. Chromium's user data directory is the parent directory of the \"Profile Path\" seen at chrome://version.\n\nNote that browsers do not allow launching multiple instances with the same User Data Directory.\n\nWARNING\n\nChromium/Chrome: Due to recent Chrome policy changes, automating the default Chrome user profile is not supported. Pointing userDataDir to Chrome's main \"User Data\" directory (the profile used for your regular browsing) may result in pages not loading or the browser exiting. Create and use a separate directory (for example, an empty folder) as your automation profile instead. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port for details.\n\naccept_downloads bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to automatically download all the attachments. Defaults to true where all the downloads are accepted.\n\nargs List[str] (optional)#\n\nWARNING\n\nUse custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.\n\nAdditional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found here.\n\nbase_url str (optional)#\n\nWhen using page.goto(), page.route(), page.wait_for_url(), page.expect_request(), or page.expect_response() it takes the base URL in consideration by using the URL() constructor for building the corresponding URL. Unset by default. Examples:\n\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000 and navigating to /bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/bar.html\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000/foo/ and navigating to ./bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/foo/bar.html\nbaseURL: http://localhost:3000/foo (without trailing slash) and navigating to ./bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/bar.html\n\nbypass_csp bool (optional)#\n\nToggles bypassing page's Content-Security-Policy.

Each certificate object must have either both certPath and keyPath, a single pfxPath, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (cert and key, or pfx). Optionally, passphrase property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The origin property should be provided with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.\n\nClient certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an origin that does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.\n\nNOTE\n\nWhen using WebKit on macOS, accessing localhost will not pick up client certificates. You can make it work by replacing localhost with local.playwright.\n\ncolor_scheme \"light\" | \"dark\" | \"no-preference\" | \"null\" (optional)#\n\nEmulates prefers-colors-scheme media feature, supported values are 'light' and 'dark'.

ElementHandles can be created with the page.query_selector() method.\n\nDISCOURAGED\n\nThe use of ElementHandle is discouraged, use Locator objects and web-first assertions instead.\n\nSync\nAsync\nhref_element = page.query_selector(\"a\")\nhref_element.click()\n\n\nElementHandle prevents DOM element from garbage collection unless the handle is disposed with js_handle.dispose(). ElementHandles are auto-disposed when their origin frame gets navigated.\n\nElementHandle instances can be used as an argument in page.eval_on_selector() and page.evaluate() methods.\n\nThe difference between the Locator and ElementHandle is that the ElementHandle points to a particular element, while Locator captures the logic of how to retrieve an element.\n\nIn the example below, handle points to a particular DOM element on page. If that element changes text or is used by React to render an entirely different component, handle is still pointing to that very DOM element. This can lead to unexpected behaviors.\n\nSync\nAsync\nhandle = page.query_selector(\"text=Submit\")\nhandle.hover()\nhandle.click()\n\n\nWith the locator, every time the element is used, up-to-date DOM element is located in the page using the selector. So in the snippet below, underlying DOM element is going to be located twice.\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator = page.get_by_text(\"Submit\")\nlocator.hover()\nlocator.click()\n\nMethods�\nbounding_box�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nThis method returns the bounding box of the element, or null if the element is not visible. The bounding box is calculated relative to the main frame viewport - which is usually the same as the browser window.\n\nScrolling affects the returned bounding box, similarly to Element.getBoundingClientRect. That means x and/or y may be negative.\n\nElements from child frames return the bounding box relative to the main frame, unlike the Element.getBoundingClientRect.\n\nAssuming the page is static, it is safe to use bounding box coordinates to perform input. For example, the following snippet should click the center of the element.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nbox = element_handle.bounding_box()\npage.mouse.click(box[\"x\"] + box[\"width\"] / 2, box[\"y\"] + box[\"height\"] / 2)\n\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType | Dict#\n\nx float\n\nthe x coordinate of the element in pixels.\n\ny float\n\nthe y coordinate of the element in pixels.\n\nwidth float\n\nthe width of the element in pixels.\n\nheight float\n\nthe height of the element in pixels.\n\ncontent_frame�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nReturns the content frame for element handles referencing iframe nodes, or null otherwise\n\nUsage\n\nelement_handle.content_frame()\n\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType | Frame#\nowner_frame�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nReturns the frame containing the given element.\n\nUsage\n\nelement_handle.owner_frame()\n\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType | Frame#\nwait_for_element_state�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nReturns when the element satisfies the state.\n\nDepending on the state parameter, this method waits for one of the actionability checks to pass. This method throws when the element is detached while waiting, unless waiting for the \"hidden\" state.\n\n\"visible\" Wait until the element is visible.\n\"hidden\" Wait until the element is not visible or not attached. Note that waiting for hidden does not throw when the element detaches.\n\"stable\" Wait until the element is both visible and stable.\n\"enabled\" Wait until the element is enabled.\n\"disabled\" Wait until the element is not enabled.\n\"editable\" Wait until the element is editable.\n\nIf the element does not satisfy the condition for the timeout milliseconds, this method will throw.\n\nUsage\n\nelement_handle.wait_for_element_state(state)\nelement_handle.wait_for_element_state(state, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nstate \"visible\" | \"hidden\" | \"stable\" | \"enabled\" | \"disabled\" | \"editable\"#\n\nA state to wait for, see below for more details.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout.

Read more about locators.\n\nThe snippet below dispatches the click event on the element. Regardless of the visibility state of the element, click is dispatched. This is equivalent to calling element.click().\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nelement_handle.dispatch_event(\"click\")\n\n\nUnder the hood, it creates an instance of an event based on the given type, initializes it with event_init properties and dispatches it on the element.

Note that you can pass an empty string to clear the input field.\n\nIf the target element is not an <input>, <textarea> or [contenteditable] element, this method throws an error. However, if the element is inside the <label> element that has an associated control, the control will be filled instead.\n\nTo send fine-grained keyboard events, use locator.press_sequentially().\n\nUsage\n\nelement_handle.fill(value)\nelement_handle.fill(value, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nvalue str#\n\nValue to set for the <input>, <textarea> or [contenteditable] element.\n\nforce bool (optional) Added in: v1.13#\n\nWhether to bypass the actionability checks.

It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the iframe and locate elements in that iframe. FrameLocator can be created with either locator.content_frame, page.frame_locator() or locator.frame_locator() method.\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator = page.locator(\"my-frame\").content_frame.get_by_text(\"Submit\")\nlocator.click()\n\n\nStrictness\n\nFrame locators are strict. This means that all operations on frame locators will throw if more than one element matches a given selector.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Throws if there are several frames in DOM:\npage.locator('.result-frame').content_frame.get_by_role('button').click()\n\n# Works because we explicitly tell locator to pick the first frame:\npage.locator('.result-frame').first.content_frame.get_by_role('button').click()\n\n\nConverting Locator to FrameLocator\n\nIf you have a Locator object pointing to an iframe it can be converted to FrameLocator using locator.content_frame.\n\nConverting FrameLocator to Locator\n\nIf you have a FrameLocator object it can be converted to Locator pointing to the same iframe using frame_locator.owner.\n\nMethods�\nframe_locator�\nAdded in: v1.17 \n\nWhen working with iframes, you can create a frame locator that will enter the iframe and allow selecting elements in that iframe.\n\nUsage\n\nframe_locator.frame_locator(selector)\n\n\nArguments\n\nselector str#\n\nA selector to use when resolving DOM element.\n\nReturns\n\nFrameLocator#\nget_by_alt_text�\nAdded in: v1.27 \n\nAllows locating elements by their alt text.\n\nUsage\n\nFor example, this method will find the image by alt text \"Playwright logo\":\n\n<img alt='Playwright logo'>\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_alt_text(\"Playwright logo\").click()\n\n\nArguments\n\ntext str | Pattern#\n\nText to locate the element for.\n\nexact bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string. Default to false. Ignored when locating by a regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\nget_by_label�\nAdded in: v1.27 \n\nAllows locating input elements by the text of the associated <label> or aria-labelledby element, or by the aria-label attribute.\n\nUsage\n\nFor example, this method will find inputs by label \"Username\" and \"Password\" in the following DOM:\n\n<input aria-label=\"Username\">\n<label for=\"password-input\">Password:</label>\n<input id=\"password-input\">\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_label(\"Username\").fill(\"john\")\npage.get_by_label(\"Password\").fill(\"secret\")\n\n\nArguments\n\ntext str | Pattern#\n\nText to locate the element for.\n\nexact bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string.

You can find all the supported roles here. ARIA guidelines do not recommend duplicating implicit roles and attributes by setting role and/or aria-* attributes to default values.\n\nget_by_test_id�\nAdded in: v1.27 \n\nLocate element by the test id.\n\nUsage\n\nConsider the following DOM structure.\n\n<button data-testid=\"directions\">Itinéraire</button>\n\n\nYou can locate the element by it's test id:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_test_id(\"directions\").click()\n\n\nArguments\n\ntest_id str | Pattern#\n\nId to locate the element by.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\n\nDetails\n\nBy default, the data-testid attribute is used as a test id. Use selectors.set_test_id_attribute() to configure a different test id attribute if necessary.\n\nget_by_text�\nAdded in: v1.27 \n\nAllows locating elements that contain given text.\n\nSee also locator.filter() that allows to match by another criteria, like an accessible role, and then filter by the text content.\n\nUsage\n\nConsider the following DOM structure:\n\n<div>Hello <span>world</span></div>\n<div>Hello</div>\n\n\nYou can locate by text substring, exact string, or a regular expression:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Matches <span>\npage.get_by_text(\"world\")\n\n# Matches first <div>\npage.get_by_text(\"Hello world\")\n\n# Matches second <div>\npage.get_by_text(\"Hello\", exact=True)\n\n# Matches both <div>s\npage.get_by_text(re.compile(\"Hello\"))\n\n# Matches second <div>\npage.get_by_text(re.compile(\"^hello$\", re.IGNORECASE))\n\n\nArguments\n\ntext str | Pattern#\n\nText to locate the element for.\n\nexact bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string. Default to false. Ignored when locating by a regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\n\nDetails\n\nMatching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nInput elements of the type button and submit are matched by their value instead of the text content. For example, locating by text \"Log in\" matches <input type=button value=\"Log in\">.\n\nget_by_title�\nAdded in: v1.27 \n\nAllows locating elements by their title attribute.\n\nUsage\n\nConsider the following DOM structure.\n\n<span title='Issues count'>25 issues</span>\n\n\nYou can check the issues count after locating it by the title text:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_title(\"Issues count\")).to_have_text(\"25 issues\")\n\n\nArguments\n\ntext str | Pattern#\n\nText to locate the element for.\n\nexact bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string. Default to false. Ignored when locating by a regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\nlocator�\nAdded in: v1.17 \n\nThe method finds an element matching the specified selector in the locator's subtree. It also accepts filter options, similar to locator.filter() method.\n\nLearn more about locators.\n\nUsage\n\nframe_locator.locator(selector_or_locator)\nframe_locator.locator(selector_or_locator, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nselector_or_locator str | Locator#\n\nA selector or locator to use when resolving DOM element.\n\nhas Locator (optional)#\n\nNarrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example, article that has text=Playwright matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nInner locator must be relative to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not the document root.

ControlOrMeta resolves to Control on Windows and Linux and to Meta on macOS.\n\nHolding down Shift will type the text that corresponds to the key in the upper case.\n\nIf key is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values a and A will generate different respective texts.\n\nIf key is a modifier key, Shift, Meta, Control, or Alt, subsequent key presses will be sent with that modifier active.

The status code for such responses can be retrieved by calling response.status.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe method either throws an error or returns a main resource response. The only exceptions are navigation to about:blank or navigation to the same URL with a different hash, which would succeed and return null.\n\nNOTE\n\nHeadless mode doesn't support navigation to a PDF document. See the upstream issue.\n\nUsage\n\nframe.goto(url)\nframe.goto(url, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nurl str#\n\nURL to navigate frame to.

That would happen if the DOM structure between those actions has changed.\n\nLearn more about locators.\n\nLearn more about locators.\n\nUsage\n\nframe.locator(selector)\nframe.locator(selector, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nselector str#\n\nA selector to use when resolving DOM element.\n\nhas Locator (optional)#\n\nNarrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example, article that has text=Playwright matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nInner locator must be relative to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not the document root. For example, you can find content that has div in <article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>. However, looking for content that has article div will fail, because the inner locator must be relative and should not use any elements outside the content.\n\nNote that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain FrameLocators.\n\nhas_not Locator (optional) Added in: v1.33#\n\nMatches elements that do not contain an element that matches an inner locator. Inner locator is queried against the outer one. For example, article that does not have div matches <article><span>Playwright</span></article>.\n\nNote that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain FrameLocators.\n\nhas_not_text str | Pattern (optional) Added in: v1.33#\n\nMatches elements that do not contain specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring.\n\nhas_text str | Pattern (optional)#\n\nMatches elements containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring. For example, \"Playwright\" matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\nset_content�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nThis method internally calls document.write(), inheriting all its specific characteristics and behaviors.\n\nUsage\n\nframe.set_content(html)\nframe.set_content(html, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nhtml str#\n\nHTML markup to assign to the page.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum operation time in milliseconds, defaults to 30 seconds, pass 0 to disable timeout.

Read more about locators.\n\nReturns when element specified by selector satisfies state option. Returns null if waiting for hidden or detached.\n\nNOTE\n\nPlaywright automatically waits for element to be ready before performing an action. Using Locator objects and web-first assertions make the code wait-for-selector-free.\n\nWait for the selector to satisfy state option (either appear/disappear from dom, or become visible/hidden). If at the moment of calling the method selector already satisfies the condition, the method will return immediately. If the selector doesn't satisfy the condition for the timeout milliseconds, the function will throw.\n\nUsage\n\nThis method works across navigations:\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright\n\ndef run(playwright: Playwright):\n    chromium = playwright.chromium\n    browser = chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    for current_url in [\"https://google.com\", \"https://bbc.com\"]:\n        page.goto(current_url, wait_until=\"domcontentloaded\")\n        element = page.main_frame.wait_for_selector(\"img\")\n        print(\"Loaded image: \" + str(element.get_attribute(\"src\")))\n    browser.close()\n\nwith sync_playwright() as playwright:\n    run(playwright)\n\n\nArguments\n\nselector str#\n\nA selector to query for.\n\nstate \"attached\" | \"detached\" | \"visible\" | \"hidden\" (optional)#\n\nDefaults to 'visible'. Can be either:\n\n'attached' - wait for element to be present in DOM.\n'detached' - wait for element to not be present in DOM.\n'visible' - wait for element to have non-empty bounding box and no visibility:hidden. Note that element without any content or with display:none has an empty bounding box and is not considered visible.\n'hidden' - wait for element to be either detached from DOM, or have an empty bounding box or visibility:hidden. This is opposite to the 'visible' option.\n\nstrict bool (optional) Added in: v1.14#\n\nWhen true, the call requires selector to resolve to a single element. If given selector resolves to more than one element, the call throws an exception.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds).

A locator can be created with the page.locator() method.\n\nLearn more about locators.\n\nMethods�\nall�\nAdded in: v1.29 \n\nWhen the locator points to a list of elements, this returns an array of locators, pointing to their respective elements.\n\nNOTE\n\nlocator.all() does not wait for elements to match the locator, and instead immediately returns whatever is present in the page.\n\nWhen the list of elements changes dynamically, locator.all() will produce unpredictable and flaky results.\n\nWhen the list of elements is stable, but loaded dynamically, wait for the full list to finish loading before calling locator.all().\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nfor li in page.get_by_role('listitem').all():\n  li.click();\n\n\nReturns\n\nList[Locator]#\nall_inner_texts�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nReturns an array of node.innerText values for all matching nodes.\n\nASSERTING TEXT\n\nIf you need to assert text on the page, prefer expect(locator).to_have_text() with use_inner_text option to avoid flakiness. See assertions guide for more details.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\ntexts = page.get_by_role(\"link\").all_inner_texts()\n\n\nReturns\n\nList[str]#\nall_text_contents�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nReturns an array of node.textContent values for all matching nodes.\n\nASSERTING TEXT\n\nIf you need to assert text on the page, prefer expect(locator).to_have_text() to avoid flakiness. See assertions guide for more details.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\ntexts = page.get_by_role(\"link\").all_text_contents()\n\n\nReturns\n\nList[str]#\nand_�\nAdded in: v1.34 \n\nCreates a locator that matches both this locator and the argument locator.\n\nUsage\n\nThe following example finds a button with a specific title.\n\nSync\nAsync\nbutton = page.get_by_role(\"button\").and_(page.get_by_title(\"Subscribe\"))\n\n\nArguments\n\nlocator Locator#\n\nAdditional locator to match.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\naria_snapshot�\nAdded in: v1.49 \n\nCaptures the aria snapshot of the given element. Read more about aria snapshots and expect(locator).to_match_aria_snapshot() for the corresponding assertion.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"link\").aria_snapshot()\n\n\nArguments\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nReturns\n\nstr#\n\nDetails\n\nThis method captures the aria snapshot of the given element. The snapshot is a string that represents the state of the element and its children. The snapshot can be used to assert the state of the element in the test, or to compare it to state in the future.\n\nThe ARIA snapshot is represented using YAML markup language:\n\nThe keys of the objects are the roles and optional accessible names of the elements.\nThe values are either text content or an array of child elements.\nGeneric static text can be represented with the text key.\n\nBelow is the HTML markup and the respective ARIA snapshot:\n\n<ul aria-label=\"Links\">\n  <li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/about\">About</a></li>\n<ul>\n\n- list \"Links\":\n  - listitem:\n    - link \"Home\"\n  - listitem:\n    - link \"About\"\n\nblur�\nAdded in: v1.28 \n\nCalls blur on the element.\n\nUsage\n\nlocator.blur()\nlocator.blur(**kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nbounding_box�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nThis method returns the bounding box of the element matching the locator, or null if the element is not visible. The bounding box is calculated relative to the main frame viewport - which is usually the same as the browser window.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nbox = page.get_by_role(\"button\").bounding_box()\npage.mouse.click(box[\"x\"] + box[\"width\"] / 2, box[\"y\"] + box[\"height\"] / 2)\n\n\nArguments\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType | Dict#\n\nx float\n\nthe x coordinate of the element in pixels.\n\ny float\n\nthe y coordinate of the element in pixels.\n\nwidth float\n\nthe width of the element in pixels.\n\nheight float\n\nthe height of the element in pixels.\n\nDetails\n\nScrolling affects the returned bounding box, similarly to Element.getBoundingClientRect. That means x and/or y may be negative.\n\nElements from child frames return the bounding box relative to the main frame, unlike the Element.getBoundingClientRect.\n\nAssuming the page is static, it is safe to use bounding box coordinates to perform input. For example, the following snippet should click the center of the element.\n\ncheck�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nEnsure that checkbox or radio element is checked.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"checkbox\").check()\n\n\nArguments\n\nforce bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to bypass the actionability checks. Defaults to false.\n\nno_wait_after bool (optional)#\n\nDEPRECATED\n\nThis option has no effect.\n\nThis option has no effect.\n\nposition Dict (optional)#\n\nx float\n\ny float\n\nA point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of the element.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\ntrial bool (optional)#\n\nWhen set, this method only performs the actionability checks and skips the action. Defaults to false. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\n\nDetails\n\nPerforms the following steps:\n\nEnsure that element is a checkbox or a radio input. If not, this method throws. If the element is already checked, this method returns immediately.\nWait for actionability checks on the element, unless force option is set.\nScroll the element into view if needed.\nUse page.mouse to click in the center of the element.\nEnsure that the element is now checked. If not, this method throws.\n\nIf the element is detached from the DOM at any moment during the action, this method throws.\n\nWhen all steps combined have not finished during the specified timeout, this method throws a TimeoutError. Passing zero timeout disables this.\n\nclear�\nAdded in: v1.28 \n\nClear the input field.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"textbox\").clear()\n\n\nArguments\n\nforce bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to bypass the actionability checks. Defaults to false.\n\nno_wait_after bool (optional)#\n\nDEPRECATED\n\nThis option has no effect.\n\nThis option has no effect.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\n\nDetails\n\nThis method waits for actionability checks, focuses the element, clears it and triggers an input event after clearing.\n\nIf the target element is not an <input>, <textarea> or [contenteditable] element, this method throws an error. However, if the element is inside the <label> element that has an associated control, the control will be cleared instead.\n\nclick�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nClick an element.\n\nUsage\n\nClick a button:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"button\").click()\n\n\nShift-right-click at a specific position on a canvas:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.locator(\"canvas\").click(\n    button=\"right\", modifiers=[\"Shift\"], position={\"x\": 23, \"y\": 32}\n)\n\n\nArguments\n\nbutton \"left\" | \"right\" | \"middle\" (optional)#\n\nDefaults to left.\n\nclick_count int (optional)#\n\ndefaults to 1.

You can opt out of waiting via setting this flag. You would only need this option in the exceptional cases such as navigating to inaccessible pages. Defaults to false.\n\nposition Dict (optional)#\n\nx float\n\ny float\n\nA point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of the element.\n\nsteps int (optional) Added in: v1.57#\n\nDefaults to 1. Sends n interpolated mousemove events to represent travel between Playwright's current cursor position and the provided destination. When set to 1, emits a single mousemove event at the destination location.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\ntrial bool (optional)#\n\nWhen set, this method only performs the actionability checks and skips the action. Defaults to false. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it. Note that keyboard modifiers will be pressed regardless of trial to allow testing elements which are only visible when those keys are pressed.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\n\nDetails\n\nThis method clicks the element by performing the following steps:\n\nWait for actionability checks on the element, unless force option is set.\nScroll the element into view if needed.\nUse page.mouse to click in the center of the element, or the specified position.\nWait for initiated navigations to either succeed or fail, unless no_wait_after option is set.\n\nIf the element is detached from the DOM at any moment during the action, this method throws.\n\nWhen all steps combined have not finished during the specified timeout, this method throws a TimeoutError. Passing zero timeout disables this.\n\ncount�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nReturns the number of elements matching the locator.\n\nASSERTING COUNT\n\nIf you need to assert the number of elements on the page, prefer expect(locator).to_have_count() to avoid flakiness. See assertions guide for more details.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\ncount = page.get_by_role(\"listitem\").count()\n\n\nReturns\n\nint#\ndblclick�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nDouble-click an element.\n\nUsage\n\nlocator.dblclick()\nlocator.dblclick(**kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nbutton \"left\" | \"right\" | \"middle\" (optional)#\n\nDefaults to left.\n\ndelay float (optional)#\n\nTime to wait between mousedown and mouseup in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.\n\nforce bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to bypass the actionability checks. Defaults to false.\n\nmodifiers List[\"Alt\" | \"Control\" | \"ControlOrMeta\" | \"Meta\" | \"Shift\"] (optional)#\n\nModifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the operation, and then restores current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. \"ControlOrMeta\" resolves to \"Control\" on Windows and Linux and to \"Meta\" on macOS.\n\nno_wait_after bool (optional)#\n\nDEPRECATED\n\nThis option has no effect.\n\nThis option has no effect.\n\nposition Dict (optional)#\n\nx float\n\ny float\n\nA point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box.

Defaults to false. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it. Note that keyboard modifiers will be pressed regardless of trial to allow testing elements which are only visible when those keys are pressed.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\n\nDetails\n\nThis method double clicks the element by performing the following steps:\n\nWait for actionability checks on the element, unless force option is set.\nScroll the element into view if needed.\nUse page.mouse to double click in the center of the element, or the specified position.\n\nIf the element is detached from the DOM at any moment during the action, this method throws.\n\nWhen all steps combined have not finished during the specified timeout, this method throws a TimeoutError. Passing zero timeout disables this.\n\nNOTE\n\nelement.dblclick() dispatches two click events and a single dblclick event.\n\ndescribe�\nAdded in: v1.53 \n\nDescribes the locator, description is used in the trace viewer and reports. Returns the locator pointing to the same element.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nbutton = page.get_by_test_id(\"btn-sub\").describe(\"Subscribe button\")\nbutton.click()\n\n\nArguments\n\ndescription str#\n\nLocator description.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\ndispatch_event�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nProgrammatically dispatch an event on the matching element.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator.dispatch_event(\"click\")\n\n\nArguments\n\ntype str#\n\nDOM event type: \"click\", \"dragstart\", etc.\n\nevent_init EvaluationArgument (optional)#\n\nOptional event-specific initialization properties.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds.

The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\n\nDetails\n\nThe snippet above dispatches the click event on the element. Regardless of the visibility state of the element, click is dispatched. This is equivalent to calling element.click().\n\nUnder the hood, it creates an instance of an event based on the given type, initializes it with event_init properties and dispatches it on the element. Events are composed, cancelable and bubble by default.\n\nSince event_init is event-specific, please refer to the events documentation for the lists of initial properties:\n\nDeviceMotionEvent\nDeviceOrientationEvent\nDragEvent\nEvent\nFocusEvent\nKeyboardEvent\nMouseEvent\nPointerEvent\nTouchEvent\nWheelEvent\n\nYou can also specify JSHandle as the property value if you want live objects to be passed into the event:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndata_transfer = page.evaluate_handle(\"new DataTransfer()\")\nlocator.dispatch_event(\"#source\", \"dragstart\", {\"dataTransfer\": data_transfer})\n\ndrag_to�\nAdded in: v1.18 \n\nDrag the source element towards the target element and drop it.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nsource = page.locator(\"#source\")\ntarget = page.locator(\"#target\")\n\nsource.drag_to(target)\n# or specify exact positions relative to the top-left corners of the elements:\nsource.drag_to(\n  target,\n  source_position={\"x\": 34, \"y\": 7},\n  target_position={\"x\": 10, \"y\": 20}\n)\n\n\nArguments\n\ntarget Locator#\n\nLocator of the element to drag to.\n\nforce bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to bypass the actionability checks.

If not specified, some visible point of the element is used.\n\nsteps int (optional) Added in: v1.57#\n\nDefaults to 1. Sends n interpolated mousemove events to represent travel between the mousedown and mouseup of the drag. When set to 1, emits a single mousemove event at the destination location.\n\ntarget_position Dict (optional)#\n\nx float\n\ny float\n\nDrops on the target element at this point relative to the top-left corner of the element's padding box. If not specified, some visible point of the element is used.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\ntrial bool (optional)#\n\nWhen set, this method only performs the actionability checks and skips the action. Defaults to false. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\n\nDetails\n\nThis method drags the locator to another target locator or target position. It will first move to the source element, perform a mousedown, then move to the target element or position and perform a mouseup.\n\nevaluate�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nExecute JavaScript code in the page, taking the matching element as an argument.\n\nUsage\n\nPassing argument to expression:\n\nSync\nAsync\nresult = page.get_by_testid(\"myId\").evaluate(\"(element, [x, y]) => element.textContent + ' ' + x * y\", [7, 8])\nprint(result) # prints \"myId text 56\"\n\n\nArguments\n\nexpression str#\n\nJavaScript expression to be evaluated in the browser context. If the expression evaluates to a function, the function is automatically invoked.\n\narg EvaluationArgument (optional)#\n\nOptional argument to pass to expression.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the locator before evaluating. Note that after locator is resolved, evaluation itself is not limited by the timeout. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout.\n\nReturns\n\nDict#\n\nDetails\n\nReturns the return value of expression, called with the matching element as a first argument, and arg as a second argument.\n\nIf expression returns a Promise, this method will wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.\n\nIf expression throws or rejects, this method throws.\n\nevaluate_all�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nExecute JavaScript code in the page, taking all matching elements as an argument.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator = page.locator(\"div\")\nmore_than_ten = locator.evaluate_all(\"(divs, min) => divs.length > min\", 10)\n\n\nArguments\n\nexpression str#\n\nJavaScript expression to be evaluated in the browser context.

If the expression evaluates to a function, the function is automatically invoked.\n\narg EvaluationArgument (optional)#\n\nOptional argument to pass to expression.\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the locator before evaluating. Note that after locator is resolved, evaluation itself is not limited by the timeout. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout.\n\nReturns\n\nJSHandle#\n\nDetails\n\nReturns the return value of expression as aJSHandle, called with the matching element as a first argument, and arg as a second argument.\n\nThe only difference between locator.evaluate() and locator.evaluate_handle() is that locator.evaluate_handle() returns JSHandle.\n\nIf expression returns a Promise, this method will wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.\n\nIf expression throws or rejects, this method throws.\n\nSee page.evaluate_handle() for more details.\n\nfill�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nSet a value to the input field.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_role(\"textbox\").fill(\"example value\")\n\n\nArguments\n\nvalue str#\n\nValue to set for the <input>, <textarea> or [contenteditable] element.\n\nforce bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to bypass the actionability checks.

The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\n\nDetails\n\nThis method waits for actionability checks, focuses the element, fills it and triggers an input event after filling. Note that you can pass an empty string to clear the input field.\n\nIf the target element is not an <input>, <textarea> or [contenteditable] element, this method throws an error. However, if the element is inside the <label> element that has an associated control, the control will be filled instead.\n\nTo send fine-grained keyboard events, use locator.press_sequentially().\n\nfilter�\nAdded in: v1.22 \n\nThis method narrows existing locator according to the options, for example filters by text. It can be chained to filter multiple times.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nrow_locator = page.locator(\"tr\")\n# ...\nrow_locator.filter(has_text=\"text in column 1\").filter(\n    has=page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"column 2 button\")\n).screenshot()\n\n\nArguments\n\nhas Locator (optional)#\n\nNarrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example, article that has text=Playwright matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nInner locator must be relative to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not the document root. For example, you can find content that has div in <article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>.

Inner locator must not contain FrameLocators.\n\nhas_not_text str | Pattern (optional) Added in: v1.33#\n\nMatches elements that do not contain specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring.\n\nhas_text str | Pattern (optional)#\n\nMatches elements containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring. For example, \"Playwright\" matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nvisible bool (optional) Added in: v1.51#\n\nOnly matches visible or invisible elements.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\nfocus�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nCalls focus on the matching element.\n\nUsage\n\nlocator.focus()\nlocator.focus(**kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum time in milliseconds.

For example, article that has text=Playwright matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nInner locator must be relative to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not the document root. For example, you can find content that has div in <article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>. However, looking for content that has article div will fail, because the inner locator must be relative and should not use any elements outside the content.\n\nNote that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain FrameLocators.\n\nhas_not Locator (optional) Added in: v1.33#\n\nMatches elements that do not contain an element that matches an inner locator.

ControlOrMeta resolves to Control on Windows and Linux and to Meta on macOS.\n\nHolding down Shift will type the text that corresponds to the key in the upper case.\n\nIf key is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values a and A will generate different respective texts.\n\nShortcuts such as key: \"Control+o\", key: \"Control++ or key: \"Control+Shift+T\" are supported as well. When specified with the modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.\n\npress_sequentially�\nAdded in: v1.38 \nTIP\n\nIn most cases, you should use locator.fill() instead. You only need to press keys one by one if there is special keyboard handling on the page.\n\nFocuses the element, and then sends a keydown, keypress/input, and keyup event for each character in the text.\n\nTo press a special key, like Control or ArrowDown, use locator.press().\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator.press_sequentially(\"hello\") # types instantly\nlocator.press_sequentially(\"world\", delay=100) # types slower, like a user\n\n\nAn example of typing into a text field and then submitting the form:\n\nSync\nAsync\nlocator = page.get_by_label(\"Password\")\nlocator.press_sequentially(\"my password\")\nlocator.press(\"Enter\")\n\n\nArguments\n\ntext str#\n\nString of characters to sequentially press into a focused element.\n\ndelay float (optional)#\n\nTime to wait between key presses in milliseconds.

One Browser instance might have multiple Page instances.\n\nThis example creates a page, navigates it to a URL, and then saves a screenshot:\n\nSync\nAsync\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright\n\ndef run(playwright: Playwright):\n    webkit = playwright.webkit\n    browser = webkit.launch()\n    context = browser.new_context()\n    page = context.new_page()\n    page.goto(\"https://example.com\")\n    page.screenshot(path=\"screenshot.png\")\n    browser.close()\n\nwith sync_playwright() as playwright:\n    run(playwright)\n\n\nThe Page class emits various events (described below) which can be handled using any of Node's native EventEmitter methods, such as on, once or removeListener.\n\nThis example logs a message for a single page load event:\n\npage.once(\"load\", lambda: print(\"page loaded!\"))\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from events use the removeListener method:\n\ndef log_request(intercepted_request):\n    print(\"a request was made:\", intercepted_request.url)\npage.on(\"request\", log_request)\n# sometime later...\npage.remove_listener(\"request\", log_request)\n\nMethods�\nadd_init_script�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nAdds a script which would be evaluated in one of the following scenarios:\n\nWhenever the page is navigated.\nWhenever the child frame is attached or navigated. In this case, the script is evaluated in the context of the newly attached frame.\n\nThe script is evaluated after the document was created but before any of its scripts were run. This is useful to amend the JavaScript environment, e.g. to seed Math.random.\n\nUsage\n\nAn example of overriding Math.random before the page loads:\n\n// preload.js\nMath.random = () => 42;\n\nSync\nAsync\n# in your playwright script, assuming the preload.js file is in same directory\npage.add_init_script(path=\"./preload.js\")\n\nNOTE\n\nThe order of evaluation of multiple scripts installed via browser_context.add_init_script() and page.add_init_script() is not defined.\n\nArguments\n\npath Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)#\n\nPath to the JavaScript file. If path is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. Optional.\n\nscript str (optional)#\n\nScript to be evaluated in all pages in the browser context. Optional.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nadd_locator_handler�\nAdded in: v1.42 \n\nWhen testing a web page, sometimes unexpected overlays like a \"Sign up\" dialog appear and block actions you want to automate, e.g. clicking a button. These overlays don't always show up in the same way or at the same time, making them tricky to handle in automated tests.\n\nThis method lets you set up a special function, called a handler, that activates when it detects that overlay is visible. The handler's job is to remove the overlay, allowing your test to continue as if the overlay wasn't there.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\nWhen an overlay is shown predictably, we recommend explicitly waiting for it in your test and dismissing it as a part of your normal test flow, instead of using page.add_locator_handler().\nPlaywright checks for the overlay every time before executing or retrying an action that requires an actionability check, or before performing an auto-waiting assertion check. When overlay is visible, Playwright calls the handler first, and then proceeds with the action/assertion. Note that the handler is only called when you perform an action/assertion - if the overlay becomes visible but you don't perform any actions, the handler will not be triggered.\nAfter executing the handler, Playwright will ensure that overlay that triggered the handler is not visible anymore. You can opt-out of this behavior with no_wait_after.\nThe execution time of the handler counts towards the timeout of the action/assertion that executed the handler. If your handler takes too long, it might cause timeouts.\nYou can register multiple handlers. However, only a single handler will be running at a time. Make sure the actions within a handler don't depend on another handler.\nWARNING\n\nRunning the handler will alter your page state mid-test. For example it will change the currently focused element and move the mouse. Make sure that actions that run after the handler are self-contained and do not rely on the focus and mouse state being unchanged.\n\nFor example, consider a test that calls locator.focus() followed by keyboard.press(). If your handler clicks a button between these two actions, the focused element most likely will be wrong, and key press will happen on the unexpected element. Use locator.press() instead to avoid this problem.\n\nAnother example is a series of mouse actions, where mouse.move() is followed by mouse.down(). Again, when the handler runs between these two actions, the mouse position will be wrong during the mouse down. Prefer self-contained actions like locator.click() that do not rely on the state being unchanged by a handler.\n\nUsage\n\nAn example that closes a \"Sign up to the newsletter\" dialog when it appears:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Setup the handler.\ndef handler():\n  page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"No thanks\").click()\npage.add_locator_handler(page.get_by_text(\"Sign up to the newsletter\"), handler)\n\n# Write the test as usual.\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\npage.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Start here\").click()\n\n\nAn example that skips the \"Confirm your security details\" page when it is shown:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Setup the handler.\ndef handler():\n  page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Remind me later\").click()\npage.add_locator_handler(page.get_by_text(\"Confirm your security details\"), handler)\n\n# Write the test as usual.\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\npage.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Start here\").click()\n\n\nAn example with a custom callback on every actionability check. It uses a <body> locator that is always visible, so the handler is called before every actionability check. It is important to specify no_wait_after, because the handler does not hide the <body> element.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Setup the handler.\ndef handler():\n  page.evaluate(\"window.removeObstructionsForTestIfNeeded()\")\npage.add_locator_handler(page.locator(\"body\"), handler, no_wait_after=True)\n\n# Write the test as usual.\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\npage.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Start here\").click()\n\n\nHandler takes the original locator as an argument. You can also automatically remove the handler after a number of invocations by setting times:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef handler(locator):\n  locator.click()\npage.add_locator_handler(page.get_by_label(\"Close\"), handler, times=1)\n\n\nArguments\n\nlocator Locator#\n\nLocator that triggers the handler.\n\nhandler Callable[Locator]:Promise[Any]#\n\nFunction that should be run once locator appears.

You can find all the supported roles here. ARIA guidelines do not recommend duplicating implicit roles and attributes by setting role and/or aria-* attributes to default values.\n\nget_by_test_id�\nAdded in: v1.27 \n\nLocate element by the test id.\n\nUsage\n\nConsider the following DOM structure.\n\n<button data-testid=\"directions\">Itinéraire</button>\n\n\nYou can locate the element by it's test id:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.get_by_test_id(\"directions\").click()\n\n\nArguments\n\ntest_id str | Pattern#\n\nId to locate the element by.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\n\nDetails\n\nBy default, the data-testid attribute is used as a test id. Use selectors.set_test_id_attribute() to configure a different test id attribute if necessary.\n\nget_by_text�\nAdded in: v1.27 \n\nAllows locating elements that contain given text.\n\nSee also locator.filter() that allows to match by another criteria, like an accessible role, and then filter by the text content.\n\nUsage\n\nConsider the following DOM structure:\n\n<div>Hello <span>world</span></div>\n<div>Hello</div>\n\n\nYou can locate by text substring, exact string, or a regular expression:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Matches <span>\npage.get_by_text(\"world\")\n\n# Matches first <div>\npage.get_by_text(\"Hello world\")\n\n# Matches second <div>\npage.get_by_text(\"Hello\", exact=True)\n\n# Matches both <div>s\npage.get_by_text(re.compile(\"Hello\"))\n\n# Matches second <div>\npage.get_by_text(re.compile(\"^hello$\", re.IGNORECASE))\n\n\nArguments\n\ntext str | Pattern#\n\nText to locate the element for.\n\nexact bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string. Default to false. Ignored when locating by a regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\n\nDetails\n\nMatching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nInput elements of the type button and submit are matched by their value instead of the text content. For example, locating by text \"Log in\" matches <input type=button value=\"Log in\">.\n\nget_by_title�\nAdded in: v1.27 \n\nAllows locating elements by their title attribute.\n\nUsage\n\nConsider the following DOM structure.\n\n<span title='Issues count'>25 issues</span>\n\n\nYou can check the issues count after locating it by the title text:\n\nSync\nAsync\nexpect(page.get_by_title(\"Issues count\")).to_have_text(\"25 issues\")\n\n\nArguments\n\ntext str | Pattern#\n\nText to locate the element for.\n\nexact bool (optional)#\n\nWhether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string.

In case of multiple redirects, the navigation will resolve with the first non-redirect response.\n\nThe method will throw an error if:\n\nthere's an SSL error (e.g. in case of self-signed certificates).\ntarget URL is invalid.\nthe timeout is exceeded during navigation.\nthe remote server does not respond or is unreachable.\nthe main resource failed to load.\n\nThe method will not throw an error when any valid HTTP status code is returned by the remote server, including 404 \"Not Found\" and 500 \"Internal Server Error\". The status code for such responses can be retrieved by calling response.status.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe method either throws an error or returns a main resource response. The only exceptions are navigation to about:blank or navigation to the same URL with a different hash, which would succeed and return null.\n\nNOTE\n\nHeadless mode doesn't support navigation to a PDF document. See the upstream issue.\n\nUsage\n\npage.goto(url)\npage.goto(url, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nurl str#\n\nURL to navigate page to. The url should include scheme, e.g. https://. When a base_url via the context options was provided and the passed URL is a path, it gets merged via the new URL() constructor.\n\nreferer str (optional)#\n\nReferer header value. If provided it will take preference over the referer header value set by page.set_extra_http_headers().\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum operation time in milliseconds, defaults to 30 seconds, pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_navigation_timeout(), browser_context.set_default_timeout(), page.set_default_navigation_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nwait_until \"load\" | \"domcontentloaded\" | \"networkidle\" | \"commit\" (optional)#\n\nWhen to consider operation succeeded, defaults to load.

Don't use this method for testing, rely on web assertions to assess readiness instead.\n'commit' - consider operation to be finished when network response is received and the document started loading.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType | Response#\nlocator�\nAdded in: v1.14 \n\nThe method returns an element locator that can be used to perform actions on this page / frame. Locator is resolved to the element immediately before performing an action, so a series of actions on the same locator can in fact be performed on different DOM elements. That would happen if the DOM structure between those actions has changed.\n\nLearn more about locators.\n\nUsage\n\npage.locator(selector)\npage.locator(selector, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nselector str#\n\nA selector to use when resolving DOM element.\n\nhas Locator (optional)#\n\nNarrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example, article that has text=Playwright matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nInner locator must be relative to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not the document root. For example, you can find content that has div in <article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>. However, looking for content that has article div will fail, because the inner locator must be relative and should not use any elements outside the content.\n\nNote that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain FrameLocators.\n\nhas_not Locator (optional) Added in: v1.33#\n\nMatches elements that do not contain an element that matches an inner locator. Inner locator is queried against the outer one. For example, article that does not have div matches <article><span>Playwright</span></article>.\n\nNote that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain FrameLocators.\n\nhas_not_text str | Pattern (optional) Added in: v1.33#\n\nMatches elements that do not contain specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring.\n\nhas_text str | Pattern (optional)#\n\nMatches elements containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring. For example, \"Playwright\" matches <article><div>Playwright</div></article>.\n\nReturns\n\nLocator#\nopener�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nReturns the opener for popup pages and null for others. If the opener has been closed already the returns null.\n\nUsage\n\npage.opener()\n\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType | Page#\npage_errors�\nAdded in: v1.56 \n\nReturns up to (currently) 200 last page errors from this page.

Playwright will stop executing the script and wait for the user to either press the 'Resume' button in the page overlay or to call playwright.resume() in the DevTools console.\n\nUser can inspect selectors or perform manual steps while paused. Resume will continue running the original script from the place it was paused.\n\nNOTE\n\nThis method requires Playwright to be started in a headed mode, with a falsy headless option.\n\nUsage\n\npage.pause()\n\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\npdf�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nReturns the PDF buffer.\n\npage.pdf() generates a pdf of the page with print css media. To generate a pdf with screen media, call page.emulate_media() before calling page.pdf():\n\nNOTE\n\nBy default, page.pdf() generates a pdf with modified colors for printing. Use the -webkit-print-color-adjust property to force rendering of exact colors.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\n# generates a pdf with \"screen\" media type.\npage.emulate_media(media=\"screen\")\npage.pdf(path=\"page.pdf\")\n\n\nThe width, height, and margin options accept values labeled with units. Unlabeled values are treated as pixels.\n\nA few examples:\n\npage.pdf({width: 100}) - prints with width set to 100 pixels\npage.pdf({width: '100px'}) - prints with width set to 100 pixels\npage.pdf({width: '10cm'}) - prints with width set to 10 centimeters.\n\nAll possible units are:\n\npx - pixel\nin - inch\ncm - centimeter\nmm - millimeter\n\nThe format options are:\n\nLetter: 8.5in x 11in\nLegal: 8.5in x 14in\nTabloid: 11in x 17in\nLedger: 17in x 11in\nA0: 33.1in x 46.8in\nA1: 23.4in x 33.1in\nA2: 16.54in x 23.4in\nA3: 11.7in x 16.54in\nA4: 8.27in x 11.7in\nA5: 5.83in x 8.27in\nA6: 4.13in x 5.83in\nNOTE\n\nheader_template and footer_template markup have the following limitations: > 1.

Defaults to 0.\n\nleft str | float (optional)\n\nLeft margin, accepts values labeled with units. Defaults to 0.\n\nPaper margins, defaults to none.\n\noutline bool (optional) Added in: v1.42#\n\nWhether or not to embed the document outline into the PDF. Defaults to false.\n\npage_ranges str (optional)#\n\nPaper ranges to print, e.g., '1-5, 8, 11-13'. Defaults to the empty string, which means print all pages.\n\npath Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)#\n\nThe file path to save the PDF to. If path is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. If no path is provided, the PDF won't be saved to the disk.\n\nprefer_css_page_size bool (optional)#\n\nGive any CSS @page size declared in the page priority over what is declared in width and height or format options.

Returns the main resource response. In case of multiple redirects, the navigation will resolve with the response of the last redirect.\n\nUsage\n\npage.reload()\npage.reload(**kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum operation time in milliseconds, defaults to 30 seconds, pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_navigation_timeout(), browser_context.set_default_timeout(), page.set_default_navigation_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nwait_until \"load\" | \"domcontentloaded\" | \"networkidle\" | \"commit\" (optional)#\n\nWhen to consider operation succeeded, defaults to load. Events can be either:\n\n'domcontentloaded' - consider operation to be finished when the DOMContentLoaded event is fired.\n'load' - consider operation to be finished when the load event is fired.\n'networkidle' - DISCOURAGED consider operation to be finished when there are no network connections for at least 500 ms. Don't use this method for testing, rely on web assertions to assess readiness instead.\n'commit' - consider operation to be finished when network response is received and the document started loading.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType | Response#\nremove_locator_handler�\nAdded in: v1.44 \n\nRemoves all locator handlers added by page.add_locator_handler() for a specific locator.\n\nUsage\n\npage.remove_locator_handler(locator)\n\n\nArguments\n\nlocator Locator#\n\nLocator passed to page.add_locator_handler().\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nrequest_gc�\nAdded in: v1.48 \n\nRequest the page to perform garbage collection. Note that there is no guarantee that all unreachable objects will be collected.\n\nThis is useful to help detect memory leaks. For example, if your page has a large object 'suspect' that might be leaked, you can check that it does not leak by using a WeakRef.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# 1. In your page, save a WeakRef for the \"suspect\".\npage.evaluate(\"globalThis.suspectWeakRef = new WeakRef(suspect)\")\n# 2. Request garbage collection.\npage.request_gc()\n# 3. Check that weak ref does not deref to the original object.\nassert page.evaluate(\"!globalThis.suspectWeakRef.deref()\")\n\n\nUsage\n\npage.request_gc()\n\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nrequests�\nAdded in: v1.56 \n\nReturns up to (currently) 100 last network request from this page. See page.on(\"request\") for more details.\n\nReturned requests should be accessed immediately, otherwise they might be collected to prevent unbounded memory growth as new requests come in. Once collected, retrieving most information about the request is impossible.\n\nNote that requests reported through the page.on(\"request\") request are not collected, so there is a trade off between efficient memory usage with page.requests() and the amount of available information reported through page.on(\"request\").\n\nUsage\n\npage.requests()\n\n\nReturns\n\nList[Request]#\nroute�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nRouting provides the capability to modify network requests that are made by a page.\n\nOnce routing is enabled, every request matching the url pattern will stall unless it's continued, fulfilled or aborted.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe handler will only be called for the first url if the response is a redirect.\n\nNOTE\n\npage.route() will not intercept requests intercepted by Service Worker. See this issue. We recommend disabling Service Workers when using request interception by setting service_workers to 'block'.\n\nNOTE\n\npage.route() will not intercept the first request of a popup page. Use browser_context.route() instead.\n\nUsage\n\nAn example of a naive handler that aborts all image requests:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage = browser.new_page()\npage.route(\"**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}\", lambda route: route.abort())\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\nbrowser.close()\n\n\nor the same snippet using a regex pattern instead:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage = browser.new_page()\npage.route(re.compile(r\"(\\.png$)|(\\.jpg$)\"), lambda route: route.abort())\npage.goto(\"https://example.com\")\nbrowser.close()\n\n\nIt is possible to examine the request to decide the route action. For example, mocking all requests that contain some post data, and leaving all other requests as is:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef handle_route(route: Route):\n  if (\"my-string\" in route.request.post_data):\n    route.fulfill(body=\"mocked-data\")\n  else:\n    route.continue_()\npage.route(\"/api/**\", handle_route)\n\n\nPage routes take precedence over browser context routes (set up with browser_context.route()) when request matches both handlers.\n\nTo remove a route with its handler you can use page.unroute().\n\nNOTE\n\nEnabling routing disables http cache.\n\nArguments\n\nurl str | Pattern | Callable[URL]:bool#\n\nA glob pattern, regex pattern, or predicate that receives a URL to match during routing. If base_url is set in the context options and the provided URL is a string that does not start with *, it is resolved using the new URL() constructor.\n\nhandler Callable[Route, Request]:Promise[Any] | Any#\n\nhandler function to route the request.\n\ntimes int (optional) Added in: v1.15#\n\nHow often a route should be used. By default it will be used every time.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nroute_from_har�\nAdded in: v1.23 \n\nIf specified the network requests that are made in the page will be served from the HAR file. Read more about Replaying from HAR.\n\nPlaywright will not serve requests intercepted by Service Worker from the HAR file. See this issue. We recommend disabling Service Workers when using request interception by setting service_workers to 'block'.\n\nUsage\n\npage.route_from_har(har)\npage.route_from_har(har, **kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nhar Union[str, pathlib.Path]#\n\nPath to a HAR file with prerecorded network data. If path is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory.\n\nnot_found \"abort\" | \"fallback\" (optional)#\n\nIf set to 'abort' any request not found in the HAR file will be aborted.\nIf set to 'fallback' missing requests will be sent to the network.\n\nDefaults to abort.\n\nupdate bool (optional)#\n\nIf specified, updates the given HAR with the actual network information instead of serving from file. The file is written to disk when browser_context.close() is called.\n\nupdate_content \"embed\" | \"attach\" (optional) Added in: v1.32#\n\nOptional setting to control resource content management. If attach is specified, resources are persisted as separate files or entries in the ZIP archive. If embed is specified, content is stored inline the HAR file.\n\nupdate_mode \"full\" | \"minimal\" (optional) Added in: v1.32#\n\nWhen set to minimal, only record information necessary for routing from HAR. This omits sizes, timing, page, cookies, security and other types of HAR information that are not used when replaying from HAR. Defaults to minimal.\n\nurl str | Pattern (optional)#\n\nA glob pattern, regular expression or predicate to match the request URL. Only requests with URL matching the pattern will be served from the HAR file. If not specified, all requests are served from the HAR file.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nroute_web_socket�\nAdded in: v1.48 \n\nThis method allows to modify websocket connections that are made by the page.\n\nNote that only WebSockets created after this method was called will be routed. It is recommended to call this method before navigating the page.\n\nUsage\n\nBelow is an example of a simple mock that responds to a single message. See WebSocketRoute for more details and examples.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef message_handler(ws: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  if message == \"request\":\n    ws.send(\"response\")\n\ndef handler(ws: WebSocketRoute):\n  ws.on_message(lambda message: message_handler(ws, message))\n\npage.route_web_socket(\"/ws\", handler)\n\n\nArguments\n\nurl str | Pattern | Callable[URL]:bool#\n\nOnly WebSockets with the url matching this pattern will be routed. A string pattern can be relative to the base_url context option.\n\nhandler Callable[WebSocketRoute]:Promise[Any] | Any#\n\nHandler function to route the WebSocket.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nscreenshot�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nReturns the buffer with the captured screenshot.\n\nUsage\n\npage.screenshot()\npage.screenshot(**kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\nanimations \"disabled\" | \"allow\" (optional)#\n\nWhen set to \"disabled\", stops CSS animations, CSS transitions and Web Animations. Animations get different treatment depending on their duration:\n\nfinite animations are fast-forwarded to completion, so they'll fire transitionend event.\ninfinite animations are canceled to initial state, and then played over after the screenshot.\n\nDefaults to \"allow\" that leaves animations untouched.\n\ncaret \"hide\" | \"initial\" (optional)#\n\nWhen set to \"hide\", screenshot will hide text caret. When set to \"initial\", text caret behavior will not be changed.

Read more about locators.\n\nThe snippet below dispatches the click event on the element. Regardless of the visibility state of the element, click is dispatched. This is equivalent to calling element.click().\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.dispatch_event(\"button#submit\", \"click\")\n\n\nUnder the hood, it creates an instance of an event based on the given type, initializes it with event_init properties and dispatches it on the element. Events are composed, cancelable and bubble by default.\n\nSince event_init is event-specific, please refer to the events documentation for the lists of initial properties:\n\nDeviceMotionEvent\nDeviceOrientationEvent\nDragEvent\nEvent\nFocusEvent\nKeyboardEvent\nMouseEvent\nPointerEvent\nTouchEvent\nWheelEvent\n\nYou can also specify JSHandle as the property value if you want live objects to be passed into the event:\n\nSync\nAsync\n# note you can only create data_transfer in chromium and firefox\ndata_transfer = page.evaluate_handle(\"new DataTransfer()\")\npage.dispatch_event(\"#source\", \"dragstart\", { \"dataTransfer\": data_transfer })\n\n\nArguments\n\nselector str#\n\nA selector to search for an element.

Use locator.evaluate(), other Locator helper methods or web-first assertions instead.\n\nThe method finds an element matching the specified selector within the page and passes it as a first argument to expression. If no elements match the selector, the method throws an error. Returns the value of expression.\n\nIf expression returns a Promise, then page.eval_on_selector() would wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\nsearch_value = page.eval_on_selector(\"#search\", \"el => el.value\")\npreload_href = page.eval_on_selector(\"link[rel=preload]\", \"el => el.href\")\nhtml = page.eval_on_selector(\".main-container\", \"(e, suffix) => e.outer_html + suffix\", \"hello\")\n\n\nArguments\n\nselector str#\n\nA selector to query for.\n\nexpression str#\n\nJavaScript expression to be evaluated in the browser context.

In case of multiple redirects, the navigation will resolve with the response of the last redirect. In case of navigation to a different anchor or navigation due to History API usage, the navigation will resolve with null.\n\nUsage\n\nThis resolves when the page navigates to a new URL or reloads. It is useful for when you run code which will indirectly cause the page to navigate. e.g. The click target has an onclick handler that triggers navigation from a setTimeout. Consider this example:\n\nSync\nAsync\nwith page.expect_navigation():\n    # This action triggers the navigation after a timeout.\n    page.get_by_text(\"Navigate after timeout\").click()\n# Resolves after navigation has finished\n\nNOTE\n\nUsage of the History API to change the URL is considered a navigation.\n\nArguments\n\ntimeout float (optional)#\n\nMaximum operation time in milliseconds, defaults to 30 seconds, pass 0 to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the browser_context.set_default_navigation_timeout(), browser_context.set_default_timeout(), page.set_default_navigation_timeout() or page.set_default_timeout() methods.\n\nurl str | Pattern | Callable[URL]:bool (optional)#\n\nA glob pattern, regex pattern or predicate receiving URL to match while waiting for the navigation. Note that if the parameter is a string without wildcard characters, the method will wait for navigation to URL that is exactly equal to the string.\n\nwait_until \"load\" | \"domcontentloaded\" | \"networkidle\" | \"commit\" (optional)#\n\nWhen to consider operation succeeded, defaults to load. Events can be either:\n\n'domcontentloaded' - consider operation to be finished when the DOMContentLoaded event is fired.\n'load' - consider operation to be finished when the load event is fired.\n'networkidle' - DISCOURAGED consider operation to be finished when there are no network connections for at least 500 ms. Don't use this method for testing, rely on web assertions to assess readiness instead.\n'commit' - consider operation to be finished when network response is received and the document started loading.\n\nReturns\n\nEventContextManager[Response]#\nfill�\nAdded before v1.9 \nDISCOURAGED\n\nUse locator-based locator.fill() instead.

Defaults to failed, could be one of the following:\n\n'aborted' - An operation was aborted (due to user action)\n'accessdenied' - Permission to access a resource, other than the network, was denied\n'addressunreachable' - The IP address is unreachable. This usually means that there is no route to the specified host or network.\n'blockedbyclient' - The client chose to block the request.\n'blockedbyresponse' - The request failed because the response was delivered along with requirements which are not met ('X-Frame-Options' and 'Content-Security-Policy' ancestor checks, for instance).\n'connectionaborted' - A connection timed out as a result of not receiving an ACK for data sent.\n'connectionclosed' - A connection was closed (corresponding to a TCP FIN).\n'connectionfailed' - A connection attempt failed.\n'connectionrefused' - A connection attempt was refused.\n'connectionreset' - A connection was reset (corresponding to a TCP RST).\n'internetdisconnected' - The Internet connection has been lost.\n'namenotresolved' - The host name could not be resolved.\n'timedout' - An operation timed out.\n'failed' - A generic failure occurred.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\ncontinue_�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nSends route's request to the network with optional overrides.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef handle(route, request):\n    # override headers\n    headers = {\n        **request.headers,\n        \"foo\": \"foo-value\", # set \"foo\" header\n        \"bar\": None # remove \"bar\" header\n    }\n    route.continue_(headers=headers)\n\npage.route(\"**/*\", handle)\n\n\nArguments\n\nheaders Dict[str, str] (optional)#\n\nIf set changes the request HTTP headers.

However, url, method, and post_data only apply to the original request and are not carried over to redirected requests.\n\nroute.continue_() will immediately send the request to the network, other matching handlers won't be invoked. Use route.fallback() If you want next matching handler in the chain to be invoked.\n\nWARNING\n\nSome request headers are forbidden and cannot be overridden (for example, Cookie, Host, Content-Length and others, see this MDN page for full list). If an override is provided for a forbidden header, it will be ignored and the original request header will be used.\n\nTo set custom cookies, use browser_context.add_cookies().\n\nfallback�\nAdded in: v1.23 \n\nContinues route's request with optional overrides. The method is similar to route.continue_() with the difference that other matching handlers will be invoked before sending the request.\n\nUsage\n\nWhen several routes match the given pattern, they run in the order opposite to their registration. That way the last registered route can always override all the previous ones. In the example below, request will be handled by the bottom-most handler first, then it'll fall back to the previous one and in the end will be aborted by the first registered route.\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.abort())  # Runs last.\npage.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.fallback())  # Runs second.\npage.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.fallback())  # Runs first.\n\n\nRegistering multiple routes is useful when you want separate handlers to handle different kinds of requests, for example API calls vs page resources or GET requests vs POST requests as in the example below.\n\nSync\nAsync\n# Handle GET requests.\ndef handle_get(route):\n    if route.request.method != \"GET\":\n        route.fallback()\n        return\n  # Handling GET only.\n  # ...\n\n# Handle POST requests.\ndef handle_post(route):\n    if route.request.method != \"POST\":\n        route.fallback()\n        return\n  # Handling POST only.\n  # ...\n\npage.route(\"**/*\", handle_get)\npage.route(\"**/*\", handle_post)\n\n\nOne can also modify request while falling back to the subsequent handler, that way intermediate route handler can modify url, method, headers and postData of the request.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef handle(route, request):\n    # override headers\n    headers = {\n        **request.headers,\n        \"foo\": \"foo-value\", # set \"foo\" header\n        \"bar\": None # remove \"bar\" header\n    }\n    route.fallback(headers=headers)\n\npage.route(\"**/*\", handle)\n\n\nUse route.continue_() to immediately send the request to the network, other matching handlers won't be invoked in that case.\n\nArguments\n\nheaders Dict[str, str] (optional)#\n\nIf set changes the request HTTP headers. Header values will be converted to a string.\n\nmethod str (optional)#\n\nIf set changes the request method (e.g. GET or POST).\n\npost_data str | bytes | Dict (optional)#\n\nIf set changes the post data of request.\n\nurl str (optional)#\n\nIf set changes the request URL. New URL must have same protocol as original one. Changing the URL won't affect the route matching, all the routes are matched using the original request URL.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\nfetch�\nAdded in: v1.29 \n\nPerforms the request and fetches result without fulfilling it, so that the response could be modified and then fulfilled.\n\nUsage\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef handle(route):\n    response = route.fetch()\n    json = response.json()\n    json[\"message\"][\"big_red_dog\"] = []\n    route.fulfill(response=response, json=json)\n\npage.route(\"https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all\", handle)\n\n\nArguments\n\nheaders Dict[str, str] (optional)#\n\nIf set changes the request HTTP headers. Header values will be converted to a string.\n\nmax_redirects int (optional) Added in: v1.31#\n\nMaximum number of request redirects that will be followed automatically. An error will be thrown if the number is exceeded. Defaults to 20. Pass 0 to not follow redirects.\n\nmax_retries int (optional) Added in: v1.46#\n\nMaximum number of times network errors should be retried. Currently only ECONNRESET error is retried. Does not retry based on HTTP response codes. An error will be thrown if the limit is exceeded. Defaults to 0 - no retries.\n\nmethod str (optional)#\n\nIf set changes the request method (e.g. GET or POST).\n\npost_data str | bytes | Dict (optional)#\n\nAllows to set post data of the request. If the data parameter is an object, it will be serialized to json string and content-type header will be set to application/json if not explicitly set. Otherwise the content-type header will be set to application/octet-stream if not explicitly set.\n\ntimeout float (optional) Added in: v1.33#\n\nRequest timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout.\n\nurl str (optional)#\n\nIf set changes the request URL. New URL must have same protocol as original one.\n\nReturns\n\nAPIResponse#\n\nDetails\n\nNote that headers option will apply to the fetched request as well as any redirects initiated by it. If you want to only apply headers to the original request, but not to redirects, look into route.continue_() instead.\n\nfulfill�\nAdded before v1.9 \n\nFulfills route's request with given response.\n\nUsage\n\nAn example of fulfilling all requests with 404 responses:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.fulfill(\n    status=404,\n    content_type=\"text/plain\",\n    body=\"not found!\"))\n\n\nAn example of serving static file:\n\nSync\nAsync\npage.route(\"**/xhr_endpoint\", lambda route: route.fulfill(path=\"mock_data.json\"))\n\n\nArguments\n\nbody str | bytes (optional)#\n\nResponse body.\n\ncontent_type str (optional)#\n\nIf set, equals to setting Content-Type response header.\n\nheaders Dict[str, str] (optional)#\n\nResponse headers.

This way, you can mock entire communication over the WebSocket. Here is an example that responds to a \"request\" with a \"response\".\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef message_handler(ws: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  if message == \"request\":\n    ws.send(\"response\")\n\npage.route_web_socket(\"wss://example.com/ws\", lambda ws: ws.on_message(\n    lambda message: message_handler(ws, message)\n))\n\n\nSince we do not call web_socket_route.connect_to_server inside the WebSocket route handler, Playwright assumes that WebSocket will be mocked, and opens the WebSocket inside the page automatically.\n\nHere is another example that handles JSON messages:\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef message_handler(ws: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  json_message = json.loads(message)\n  if json_message[\"request\"] == \"question\":\n    ws.send(json.dumps({ \"response\": \"answer\" }))\n\npage.route_web_socket(\"wss://example.com/ws\", lambda ws: ws.on_message(\n    lambda message: message_handler(ws, message)\n))\n\n\nIntercepting\n\nAlternatively, you may want to connect to the actual server, but intercept messages in-between and modify or block them. Calling web_socket_route.connect_to_server returns a server-side WebSocketRoute instance that you can send messages to, or handle incoming messages.\n\nBelow is an example that modifies some messages sent by the page to the server. Messages sent from the server to the page are left intact, relying on the default forwarding.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef message_handler(server: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  if message == \"request\":\n    server.send(\"request2\")\n  else:\n    server.send(message)\n\ndef handler(ws: WebSocketRoute):\n  server = ws.connect_to_server()\n  ws.on_message(lambda message: message_handler(server, message))\n\npage.route_web_socket(\"/ws\", handler)\n\n\nAfter connecting to the server, all messages are forwarded between the page and the server by default.\n\nHowever, if you call web_socket_route.on_message() on the original route, messages from the page to the server will not be forwarded anymore, but should instead be handled by the handler.\n\nSimilarly, calling web_socket_route.on_message() on the server-side WebSocket will stop forwarding messages from the server to the page, and handler should take care of them.\n\nThe following example blocks some messages in both directions. Since it calls web_socket_route.on_message() in both directions, there is no automatic forwarding at all.\n\nSync\nAsync\ndef ws_message_handler(server: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  if message != \"blocked-from-the-page\":\n    server.send(message)\n\ndef server_message_handler(ws: WebSocketRoute, message: Union[str, bytes]):\n  if message != \"blocked-from-the-server\":\n    ws.send(message)\n\ndef handler(ws: WebSocketRoute):\n  server = ws.connect_to_server()\n  ws.on_message(lambda message: ws_message_handler(server, message))\n  server.on_message(lambda message: server_message_handler(ws, message))\n\npage.route_web_socket(\"/ws\", handler)\n\nMethods�\nclose�\nAdded in: v1.48 \n\nCloses one side of the WebSocket connection.\n\nUsage\n\nweb_socket_route.close()\nweb_socket_route.close(**kwargs)\n\n\nArguments\n\ncode int (optional)#\n\nOptional close code.\n\nreason str (optional)#\n\nOptional close reason.\n\nReturns\n\nNoneType#\non_close�\nAdded in: v1.48 \n\nAllows to handle WebSocket.close.\n\nBy default, closing one side of the connection, either in the page or on the server, will close the other side.

You can handle this messages by responding to them with web_socket_route.send(), forwarding them to the server-side connection returned by web_socket_route.connect_to_server or do something else.\n\nOnce this method is called, messages are not automatically forwarded to the server or to the page - you should do that manually by calling web_socket_route.send(). See examples at the top for more details.\n\nCalling this method again will override the handler with a new one.\n\nUsage\n\nweb_socket_route.on_message(handler)\n\n\nArguments\n\nhandler Callable[str]:Promise[Any] | Any#\n\nFunction that will handle messages.\n\nsend�\nAdded in: v1.48 \n\nSends a message to the WebSocket.

I am Raghav and in this session we are going to learn step\nthis session we are going to learn step\nthis session we are going to learn step by step from scratch how to do\nby step from scratch how to do\nby step from scratch how to do datadriven testing in our playright\ndatadriven testing in our playright\ndatadriven testing in our playright Python project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you have any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So let's get started.\nlet's get started.\nlet's get started. And let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first create a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses some data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize and get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going to open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project. This is my playright project that we have been working on and\nproject that we have been working on and\nproject that we have been working on and we have already created some tests.

So let us uh just record a test and I'm\nlet us uh just record a test and I'm\nlet us uh just record a test and I'm going to go to this demo website HRM and\ngoing to go to this demo website HRM and\ngoing to go to this demo website HRM and here we can do a login using these\nhere we can do a login using these\nhere we can do a login using these username and passwords.\nusername and passwords.\nusername and passwords. So I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the test. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright code gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the application and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter. This will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or the playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a browser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So I will add username here\nI will add username here\nI will add username here admin\nadmin\nadmin admin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login. And\nAnd\nAnd this takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here let me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I will go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I will just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this dashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording and this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go to my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on this new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test. I will say test\nI will say test\nI will say test data\ndata\ndata driven demo\ndriven demo\ndriven demo py\npy\npy and we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and here I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied code from our\ncode from our\ncode from our playright inspector.\nplayright inspector.\nplayright inspector. Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.

So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you have any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So let's get started.\nlet's get started.\nlet's get started. And let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first create a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses some data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize and get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going to open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project.

So I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the test. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright code gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the application and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter. This will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or the playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a browser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So I will add username here\nI will add username here\nI will add username here admin\nadmin\nadmin admin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.

So I will go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I will just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this dashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording and this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go to my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on this new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.

Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.

This will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or the playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a browser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So I will add username here\nI will add username here\nI will add username here admin\nadmin\nadmin admin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login. And\nAnd\nAnd this takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here let me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I will go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I will just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this dashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording and this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go to my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on this new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test. I will say test\nI will say test\nI will say test data\ndata\ndata driven demo\ndriven demo\ndriven demo py\npy\npy and we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and here I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied code from our\ncode from our\ncode from our playright inspector.\nplayright inspector.\nplayright inspector. Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.

I am Raghav and in this session we are going to learn step\nthis session we are going to learn step\nthis session we are going to learn step by step from scratch how to do\nby step from scratch how to do\nby step from scratch how to do datadriven testing in our playright\ndatadriven testing in our playright\ndatadriven testing in our playright Python project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you have any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So let's get started.\nlet's get started.\nlet's get started. And let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first create a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses some data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize and get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going to open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project.

So let us uh just record a test and I'm\nlet us uh just record a test and I'm\nlet us uh just record a test and I'm going to go to this demo website HRM and\ngoing to go to this demo website HRM and\ngoing to go to this demo website HRM and here we can do a login using these\nhere we can do a login using these\nhere we can do a login using these username and passwords.\nusername and passwords.\nusername and passwords. So I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the test. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright code gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the application and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter. This will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or the playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a browser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So I will add username here\nI will add username here\nI will add username here admin\nadmin\nadmin admin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login. And\nAnd\nAnd this takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here let me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I will go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I will just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this dashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording and this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go to my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on this new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test. I will say test\nI will say test\nI will say test data\ndata\ndata driven demo\ndriven demo\ndriven demo py\npy\npy and we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and here I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied code from our\ncode from our\ncode from our playright inspector.\nplayright inspector.\nplayright inspector. Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder.

I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.

So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo.

So I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the test. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright code gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the application and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter. This will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or the playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a browser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So I will add username here\nI will add username here\nI will add username here admin\nadmin\nadmin admin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.

So I will go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I will just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this dashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording and this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go to my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on this new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.

Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.

So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you have any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So let's get started.\nlet's get started.\nlet's get started. And let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first create a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses some data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize and get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going to open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project.

So I will go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I will just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this dashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording and this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go to my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on this new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test. I will say test\nI will say test\nI will say test data\ndata\ndata driven demo\ndriven demo\ndriven demo py\npy\npy and we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and here I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied code from our\ncode from our\ncode from our playright inspector.\nplayright inspector.\nplayright inspector. Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.

I am Raghav and in this session we are going to learn step\nthis session we are going to learn step\nthis session we are going to learn step by step from scratch how to do\nby step from scratch how to do\nby step from scratch how to do datadriven testing in our playright\ndatadriven testing in our playright\ndatadriven testing in our playright Python project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you have any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So let's get started.\nlet's get started.\nlet's get started. And let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first create a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses some data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize and get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going to open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project. This is my playright project that we have been working on and\nproject that we have been working on and\nproject that we have been working on and we have already created some tests.

So let us uh just record a test and I'm\nlet us uh just record a test and I'm\nlet us uh just record a test and I'm going to go to this demo website HRM and\ngoing to go to this demo website HRM and\ngoing to go to this demo website HRM and here we can do a login using these\nhere we can do a login using these\nhere we can do a login using these username and passwords.\nusername and passwords.\nusername and passwords. So I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the test. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright code gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the application and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter. This will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or the playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a browser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So I will add username here\nI will add username here\nI will add username here admin\nadmin\nadmin admin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login. And\nAnd\nAnd this takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here let me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I will go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I will just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this dashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording and this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go to my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on this new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test. I will say test\nI will say test\nI will say test data\ndata\ndata driven demo\ndriven demo\ndriven demo py\npy\npy and we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and here I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied code from our\ncode from our\ncode from our playright inspector.\nplayright inspector.\nplayright inspector. Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.

So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo.

So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here.

Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know.

So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo.

I will say test\nI will say test\nI will say test data\ndata\ndata driven demo\ndriven demo\ndriven demo py\npy\npy and we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and here I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied code from our\ncode from our\ncode from our playright inspector.\nplayright inspector.\nplayright inspector. Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.

I am Raghav and in this session we are going to learn step\nthis session we are going to learn step\nthis session we are going to learn step by step from scratch how to do\nby step from scratch how to do\nby step from scratch how to do datadriven testing in our playright\ndatadriven testing in our playright\ndatadriven testing in our playright Python project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by\nPython project. So we will start by learning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our\nlearning how can we parameterize our tests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we\ntests and parameterization means that we replace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data\nreplace the hard-coded values the data values from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that\nvalues from our test and instead of that we use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will\nwe use variables and later on we will get the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a\nget the values of these variables from a CSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get\nCSV file. So we will learn how to get data from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also\ndata from CSV file and then we will also see how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON\nsee how can we get data from a JSON file. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this\nfile. Okay. And we will see all this with hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you\nwith hands-on demo. And whenever you have any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So\nhave any issues, you can let me know. So let's get started.\nlet's get started.\nlet's get started. And let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first\nAnd let's first see uh let us first create a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses\ncreate a very simple test case that uses some data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize\nsome data that we can then parameterize and get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going\nand get from a file. Okay. So I am going to open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project. This is my playright\nto open my project. This is my playright project that we have been working on and\nproject that we have been working on and\nproject that we have been working on and we have already created some tests.

So let us uh just record a test and I'm\nlet us uh just record a test and I'm\nlet us uh just record a test and I'm going to go to this demo website HRM and\ngoing to go to this demo website HRM and\ngoing to go to this demo website HRM and here we can do a login using these\nhere we can do a login using these\nhere we can do a login using these username and passwords.\nusername and passwords.\nusername and passwords. So I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the\nSo I will use code gen to record the test. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright\ntest. I will say playright code gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the\ncode gen and I will give the URL of the application and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter.\napplication and hit enter. This will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or\nThis will open the code gen window or the playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a\nthe playrite inspector window and a browser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So\nbrowser with our application loaded. So I will add username here\nI will add username here\nI will add username here admin\nadmin\nadmin admin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login.\nadmin 1 2 3 and click on login. And\nAnd\nAnd this takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here\nthis takes us to the homepage. And here let me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I\nlet me just uh verify something. So I will go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I\nwill go here assert visibility and I will just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this\nwill just let's say verify this dashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording\ndashboard tab and I will stop recording and this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we\nand this is our inspector window. So we have got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will\nhave got our test recorded. I will change this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it.\nchange this to pi test code and copy it. And then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project\nAnd then I will go back to my project and let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go\nand let me create a test here. I will go to my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on\nto my tests folder here and click on this new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test.\nthis new file and I will create a test. I will say test\nI will say test\nI will say test data\ndata\ndata driven demo\ndriven demo\ndriven demo py\npy\npy and we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and\nand we have got a test file created and here I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied\nhere I'm just going to paste our copied code from our\ncode from our\ncode from our playright inspector.\nplayright inspector.\nplayright inspector. Okay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here.\nOkay. So we have got this here. This is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run\nThis is fine. Uh let us very quickly run this and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine.\nthis and check if everything works fine. So here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need\nSo here this is all okay. I don't need to\nto\nto I can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually.\nI can Okay, this is all fine actually. Uh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first\nUh let me just I'll press Ctrl C first on the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector\non the terminal to close the inspector window and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and\nwindow and then I will say pi test and I'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then\nI'll go to the tests folder and then test\ntest\ntest datadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a\ndatadriven demo and let me also add a slow motion for\nslow motion for\nslow motion for uh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds\nuh let me slow down by 500 milliseconds so that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the\nso that you can see the actions on the screen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to\nscreen. So it opens the browser, goes to the application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username,\nthe application, enters username, password, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the\npassword, clicks on login, goes to the homepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed.\nhomepage and yes it has it has passed. Okay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you\nOkay. So we have our test now and you can see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data\ncan see here we are using test data which is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These\nwhich is username and password. These are the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using.\nare the two test data we are using. Okay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this\nOkay. So we will parameterize this first. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means\nfirst. So let's parameterize that means we will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of\nwe will use variables in place of hard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in\nhard-coded data values. So let me say in place of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use\nplace of this admin username I will use a variable called username.\na variable called username.\na variable called username. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a\nAnd in place of password I will use a variable called\nvariable called\nvariable called password.\npassword.\npassword. Okay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this\nOkay. And then I will have to pass this username and password\nusername and password\nusername and password from the\nfrom the\nfrom the parameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will\nparameters of this function. So I will give a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and\ngive a comma here and pass username and password. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is\npassword. Okay. So what I'm doing is this function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will\nthis function which is test example will get these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these\nget these two variables value of these two variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and\ntwo variables username and password and that will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and\nthat will be passed here username and password. Okay.\npassword. Okay.\npassword. Okay. Now\nNow\nNow we will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest\nwe will use a fixture piest domark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a\ndomark.parameterize. And this is a fixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using\nfixture from piest. So if you are using piest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture\npiest you can directly use this fixture otherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh\notherwise you will have to uh do some uh you can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python\nyou can you can use some python functions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already\nfunctions. But because we are already using piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use\nusing piest in our project let us use this fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest\nthis fixture at piest domark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize\ndomark.tparameterize and this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just\nand this we have to use just before just above the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at\nabove the function. So I will say at pyest\nthis is the username and password. These\nthis is the username and password. These are the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can\nare the two parameters and then you can give the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in\ngive the values of these parameters in this within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets.\nthis within the square brackets. Okay. So you can do it like this.\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto\nOkay. So for me it was showing auto suggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to\nsuggestion. I have pressed tab to autocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see\nautocomplete everything. But you can see here we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters\nhere we are using these two parameters username and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are\nusername and password. And then we are passing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass\npassing values here. And you can pass any sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are\nany sets of data. As of now we are passing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just\npassing three sets of data. Let me just go with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is\ngo with two sets for now so that it is faster.\nfaster.\nfaster. Okay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets\nOkay. So we can pass any number of sets of data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then\nof data comma separated values and then now see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it\nnow see in if you don't want to pass it like this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single\nlike this you can also pass in a single line or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it\nline or one set of data but otherwise it is good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple\nis good that if you are passing multiple sets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within\nsets of data you can put them within this square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep\nthis square brackets like this and keep on adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the\non adding the values by adding the commas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and\ncommas. Okay. Now let me uh try this and also you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error\nalso you can see we are getting a error here. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to\nhere. This means piest we have to import. So let me also al import piest.\nAll right. So this is what we have done.\nAll right. So this is what we have done. We have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now\nWe have used this fixture. Let us now again we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and\nagain we have done parameterization and also used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values\nalso used a fixture to get the values for these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again\nfor these variables. Let us now again run this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on\nrun this. I am pressing the up arrow on my keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command\nmy keyboard to go to the last command and I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this\nand I'll run it again. So let's see this should run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are\nshould run now two times because we are sending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a\nsending two sets of data. First one is a valid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now\nvalid credentials. So it is passed. Now this is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid\nthis is the second one which is invalid and this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it\nand this should fail. And you can see it is showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this\nis showing invalid credentials and this should fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You\nshould fail our test and that's it. You can see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed\ncan see here it is showing us one failed and one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be\nand one passed and all this will be shown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well.\nshown in the report as well. Now the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we\nNow the next thing we have to do is we have done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are\nhave done parameterization. we are getting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data\ngetting the values of our uh data data sets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in\nsets or uh the data that we are using in our test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are\nour test from variables and then we are used we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let\nused we have used the fixture. Now let us get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file.\nus get the same data from a CSV file. Okay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and\nOkay. So let us create a CSV file and store our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go\nstore our data there. So let me just go to now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know\nto now you can create this uh you know CSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system.\nCSV file anywhere on your system. However, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you\nHowever, it is recommended that if you can keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project\ncan keep the file within the project folder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in\nfolder, it will be helpful so that in case you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take\ncase you move your project, you can take the file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can\nthe file along with you and then you can also give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file\nalso give relative location of the file in your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break.\nin your code. So, it will never break. So, let me just open\nSo, let me just open\nSo, let me just open any folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file\nany folder and say reveal in file explorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project\nexplorer so that it goes to my project directory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm\ndirectory. And yes, here it is. And I'm going to make a new\ngoing to make a new\ngoing to make a new folder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder.\nfolder here in my project folder. And I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as\nAnd I will call it as test data.\ntest data.\ntest data. And I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am\nAnd I will go inside this. And here I am going to create a\ngoing to create a\ngoing to create a text file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then\ntext file first, a notepad file and then I will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say\nI will convert it into a CSV. I will say this is data\nthis is data\nthis is data and let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a\nand let me first add the data. So in a CSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated\nCSV file we add data in comma separated values. So I will say username\npassword or let me just add the username\npassword or let me just add the username password\npassword\npassword uh values here.\nuh values here.\nuh values here. Okay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here\nOkay. So I'll just say here admin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid\nadmin and admin 1 2 3. This is the valid credentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1\ncredentials and I will say user 1 and\nand\nand user 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6\nuser 1 2 3 user 2 user 4 5 6 and let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And\nand let's just save and close it. And also I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now\nalso I will make sure that I now change the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file.\nchange the extension of this file. So I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of\nSo I'm going to change the extension of this file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename\nthis file. I will rename uh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to\nuh this file and change the extension to or I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to\nor I can press F2 on my keyboard to rename and I will change it to CSV.\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this\nOkay. So now this is a CSV file and this I will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm\nI will have to get in my code. So I'm going to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create\ngoing to the next step is I will create a function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV\na function to get data from this CSV file and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function\nfile and then so let's see the function I can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load\nI can create a function let's say load CSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here\nCSV data or get CSV data. So here I will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV\nI will say def get CSV data.\ndata.\ndata. Okay. And here\nOkay. And here\nOkay. And here I will\nI will\nI will create this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say\ncreate this array and then I will say with open and give the\nwith open and give the\nwith open and give the location of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say\nlocation of my CSV file. So I will say now you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You\nnow you can do it this way as well. You can give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file\ncan give the file name and get the file here. So let me try to do it this way.\nokay so I have added this dot because\nokay so I have added this dot because this is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the\nthis is a relative path related to the project folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine.\nproject folder. This should work fine. Let us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to\nLet us now save and run. I'm going to the last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow\nthe last command. I press the up arrow to go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm\nto go to the last command and I'm executing now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It\nexecuting now. So this is running. It opens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three\nopens the browser and we have now three sets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this\nsets of data in our CSV file. So this should run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the\nshould run three times. This is the first run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is\nfirst run. The first set of data is valid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass.\nvalid credentials. So this should pass. This should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage.\nThis should take us to the homepage. And this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass.\nAnd this one should pass. Okay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one\nOkay. Yes, this is pass. The second one should fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid\nshould fail because that is invalid credential.\ncredential.\ncredential. So let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes,\nSo let's see. It was user one and yes, it is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should\nit is running fine. This one should fail.\nSo now you can also see our data is\nSo now you can also see our data is driving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any\ndriving our test. We can now give any sets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't\nsets of data in our uh file. We don't have to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any\nhave to come to our test case and do any changes for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our\nchanges for data. We will just go to our file and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever\nfile and add, delete, update, whatever data changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do\ndata changes we want to do, we will do that here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run\nthat here and the test will run accordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add\naccordingly. If I just go there and add 10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times\n10 sets of data, it will run 10 times with all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have\nwith all the sets of data that we have used there.\nused there.\nused there. Okay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all\nOkay. So yes, you can see it is all running fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with\nrunning fine. Two failed, one pass with all three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have\nall three sets of data that we have added in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are\nadded in our CSV file. Okay. So we are done with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can\ndone with CSV file. Let us see if we can use a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create\nuse a JSON file as well. So let's create a JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And\na JSON file and add our test data. And for JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in\nfor JSON file, we use data like this in a JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we\na JSON format. Okay. So this is what we will be using.\nwill be using.\nwill be using. So I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test\nSo I will go and go back to the test data folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new\ndata folder and let me create a new file again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text\nfile again. Let me start with a text document and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to\ndocument and then I will change it to JSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will\nJSON. So let me open this and I will give a\ngive a\ngive a square bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then\nsquare bracket start and end and then for each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in\nfor each set of data I will give in curly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end\ncurly brackets curly bracket start end comma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start\ncomma and then again curly bracket start end\nend\nend comma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as\ncomma and I will keep on adding for as many sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will\nmany sets of data as I want and I will give the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will\ngive the value username and I I will give the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then\ngive the value like this admin and then password\nadmin 1 2 3\nadmin 1 2 3 okay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on\nokay in the same way I will keep on adding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will\nadding so I can add uh let's say I will just copy this\nand add it here and here and I'll just\nand add it here and here and I'll just change this user\ntest two and if I want I can also change\ntest two and if I want I can also change this\nokay and save and\nokay and save and close and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am\nclose and I'll just change this I am pressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this\npressing F2 and I will change this extension to dot\nextension to dot\nextension to dot JSON.\nJSON.\nJSON. Okay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from\nOkay. Also, uh you can take help from any online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON\nany online tool. I will go to JSON beautifier\nbeautifier\nbeautifier just to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a\njust to make sure that you are using a the format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll\nthe format is correct. Okay. So, I'll just copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify.\njust copy this and say format beautify. So, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a\nSo, you can see this has given me a corrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also\ncorrected format. Although this is also correct but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can\ncorrect but just if you want you can check you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can\ncheck you can do this. Okay. And I can also just\nalso just\nalso just say open with\nand I can give it like this also this uh\nand I can give it like this also this uh you can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor\nyou can do within VS code or your editor as well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here.\nas well. You can see it has come here. So you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this\nSo you will find tools for checking this here as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So\nhere as well but that's fine. Okay. So we are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON\nwe are created we have created our JSON file and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create\nfile and now the same way we will create a function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV\na function like we have created for CSV we will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to\nwe will create a function for JSON to get data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is\nget data from our JSON file. So this is the function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def\nthe function. So I'll say def get JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has\nget JSON data and you can see it has already given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So\nalready given me all these options. So you can see this here\nyou can see this here\nyou can see this here with open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name\nwith open and give the file name as file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and\nas file and then load the data and return the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place\nreturn the data. Okay. And then in place of calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get\nof calling get CSV data I will call get JSON data here.\nAnd just to make sure I will press\nAnd just to make sure I will press control on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here.\ncontrol on my keyboard and click here. And this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So\nAnd this should take me here. Okay. So this is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update\nthis is what we will do. We will update the function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And\nthe function here in our fixture. And let us now save\nlet us now save\nlet us now save and run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow\nand run. I'm just moving the slow motion.\nLet us run and check. So this is\nLet us run and check. So this is running.\nOkay. This is the first\nOkay. This is the first run.\nrun.\nrun. Let me see.\nOkay, I think this is taking username\nOkay, I think this is taking username every time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that.\nevery time. We will have to fix that. Okay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and\nOkay, it is just taking the uh keys and not the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check\nnot the values. So, let me just check what we will be doing here.\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we\nOkay. Uh this is happening because we are returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that\nare returning data the entire data that we have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because\nwe have got in our file. So uh because we are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the\nwe are also using keys there or the names there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning\nnames there. So I should be returning item\nOr I can say here\nOr I can say here I can just use\nI can just use\nI can just use yeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username\nyeah I can say like this item username item password for item in data\nitem password for item in data\nitem password for item in data and\nand\nand then we can use all this\nthen we can use all this\nthen we can use all this but I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should\nbut I think this should find this should be enough\nbe enough\nbe enough for item in I will just Okay.\nor okay I just choose data here. So I\nor okay I just choose data here. So I should be using\nshould be using\nshould be using data because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm\ndata because whatever I use here I'm just saying\njust saying\njust saying I just want to\nI just want to\nI just want to get that.\nget that.\nget that. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now\nNow\nNow let me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will\nlet me run it again and check. I will save and run.\nsave and run.\nsave and run. So it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time\nSo it goes and yes you can see this time it is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one\nit is using the values. So the first one is right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It\nis right. The second one should fail. It is invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is\nis invalid. And the third one which is test two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine.\ntest two and this is also running fine. And this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass\nAnd this should also fail. So one pass and two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running\nand two failed and this is all running fine.\nfine.\nfine. Okay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON\nOkay. So we are able to use our JSON file for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have\nfile for datadriven testing and we have already checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run.\nalready checked we have saved and run. So I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some\nSo I will suggest that you try some options and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as\noptions and you may face some issues as you do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously\nyou do it for the first time. Obviously you will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can\nyou will be facing some issues. You can check some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can\ncheck some examples online and you can try with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you\ntry with different formats and if you face any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I\nface any issues please let me know. I will see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon. Thank you for\nwill see you soon.
