I prefer having a more native integration and haven't found anything that I couldn't do on hyprland. Syntax is more stable and feels less dependent on what a single person thinks is best. Written in rust so easier for more people to audit and contribute to the code.\n\nYou can always try it in a VM and see if you like it. At the end of the day, unless one explicitly offers something another cannot do, its just personal preference. In my case I found that to be niri.\n\n23\ndijkstras_revenge\n•\n2mo ago\n\nI haven’t tried hyprscrolling, but I did try Niri and I liked it. The setup is simpler than hyprland, but it still had a ton of flexibility. It had an overview feature that’s really nice as well. In the end I actually switched from Niri to hyprland, because I found infinite scrolling is just as bad as minimizing with regard to keeping window clutter I don’t need in a hidden virtual space.\n\n7\nPurple_Jello_4799\n•\n2mo ago\n\nif you like to switch between the layouts, you can try mangowc if you strictly like scrolling then niri is way better than hyprscrolling or any other plugin that provides this functionality to hyprland. it will actually behave like a cohesive environment unlike buggy plugins that have a poor choice of options in their configurations\n\n4\nzakklol\n•\n2mo ago\n\nThere's also 'scroll' which is a sway fork that implements a scroller layout. The author is the same person that wrote (the now retired) hyprscroller plugin.\n\nI actually like the scroll overview modes more than niri, especially the 'jump' overview (although I'm biased because it's very much like my easymotion plugin).\n\nI also much prefer the sway style workspaces over now niri does it.\n\n3\nchikamakaleyley\n•\n2mo ago\n\nyou don't need to switch\n\nyou can install Niri, and it will be an option you can select on your login screen\n\nI think Niri is great for the purposes of a scrolling window manager. It has pretty much everything I need. It works better for my workflow, I do software development\n\nHyprland is great too, it gives the user a lot more overall control, a lot more options you can customize.\n\nOne thing I can attest to is that with Hyprland my memory usage was often a lot higher from the start and would avg a lot more in usage - its been a while so i don't remember exact numbers, but for sure at least 25% more in memory, regular usage.\n\nOn the same system, same user, Niri would use 10-15% on avg; I'd need to do a lot to get it into the 20s\n\nI don't know what may have been causing that but its one of the bigger changes I noticed right from the start. With Hyprland it was normal to hear my fan speed up often, with Niri it's rare that it does.\n\n5\nFryChy\n•\n2mo ago\n\nI tried hyprscrolling for a while becuase I think compared to niri, hyprland has a lot of support and solutions online. My main problem with hyprscrolling is that whenever there is an update it breaks the plugin, and have to reinstall. The features are less comparatively, even to hyprscroller which is a former hyprland plugin and now archived.\n\n3\nryl0p3z\n•\n2mo ago\n\nAlso a dev here 👋\n\nI’ve never used hyperscrolling on Hyprland but have it on a personal computer and I have Niri on my work laptop since we are limited to what OS we can use (Fedora) and Niri works better with that.\n\nI actually really enjoy Niri once you get used to it and the overview is really handy since you can switch layouts there also. Config is very straightforward to understand and documentation has everything you need.\n\nBest thing to do is daily drive it for a week and see how productive you feel with it.\n\n1\nTsigorf\n•\n2mo ago\n\nAI generated post?\n\n0\njessecreamy\n•\n2mo ago\n\nEach monitor has its own set of workspaces, so if your cursor is on a specific monitor, it just scrolls the workspaces that belong to that monitor. Do you need that? If you dont need that, there's no point better fit.\n\n1\nRoyal_Vermicelli8904\n•\n2mo ago\n\nHyprland is IMO the most polished and up to date wayland compositor (standalone). However, the hyprscrolling doesn’t provide remotely enough config to the scrolling layout making it much worse than on Niri. Despite that, I’ll be sticking to Hyprland as it offers the most stable and feature-rich experience ☺️\n\n1\nEconomy_Cabinet_7719\n•\n2mo ago\n\nI don't recommend Hyprscrolling, it still has a way to go. Let me instead answer your question with Hyprscroller in mind.\n\nDoes Niri offer something fundamentally better than Hyprland + hyprscrolling?\n\nNothing off the top of my head. Well, focus ring is nice, but that's just a small visual feature, not important. Overview is better and multi-workspace, but hyprscroller has jump mode which is cool and very practical.\n\nAny downsides of staying with hyprscrolling long-term?\n\nCurrent fork maintainer might stop maintaining it.\n\nIs Niri more opinionated / restrictive compared to Hyprland?\n\nYes, in a lot of ways. Also lacks a lot of features that Hyprland has. Specifically the lack of layout-independent keybindings makes it a complete non-starter for me.\n\n1\nkhryx_at\n•\n2mo ago\n\nI switched to hyprland a while ago with hyprscrolling as well, I was using niri and I really love niri but I missed some features it just didn't have. Once I moved to hypr tho I REALLY missed how workspaces and navigation worked in niri so I obviously made (technically forked but in the end it became a rewrite?) a tool that allows keybind navigation across monitors and workspaces based on edge detection.\n\nIt's here https://github.com/TophC7/hyprnavi-psm I haven't posted it yet on r/hyperland but I will soon, still ironing out something else\n\n1\nRelated Answers Section\nRelated Answers\nHyprscrolling on Hyprland versus Niri\nHyprland versus River comparison\nBest Niri shaders\nRiver versus Niri comparison\nNiri versus KDE comparison\nNew to Reddit?\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\nContinue with Email\nContinue With Phone Number\nBy continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy.\nMore posts you may like\nTried Hyprscrolling on Hyprland — should I switch to Niri or just stick with this?\nr/niri\n•\n2mo ago\nTried Hyprscrolling on Hyprland — should I switch to Niri or just stick with this?\n23 upvotes · 39 comments\nWhy is everyone switching from Hyprland to Niri or River?\nr/hyprland\n•\n5mo ago\nWhy is everyone switching from Hyprland to Niri or River?\n63 comments\nSway, Hyprland or Niri?\nr/Fedora\n•\n9mo ago\nSway, Hyprland or Niri?\n2 comments\nHyprscroller\nr/hyprland\n•\n2y ago\nHyprscroller\n35 upvotes · 13 comments\nKDE >> hyprland/niri\nr/linux\n•\n2mo ago\nKDE >> hyprland/niri\n100 upvotes · 75 comments\nWhich one is best on arch hyprland vs niri\nr/archlinux\n•\n4mo ago\nWhich one is best on arch hyprland vs niri\n9 comments\nNiri > Hyprland\nr/linuxbrasil\n•\n9d ago\nNiri > Hyprland\n0:27\n20 upvotes · 15 comments\nCan someone explain to me what Hyprland exactly is?\nr/hyprland\n•\n2y ago\nCan someone explain to me what Hyprland exactly is?\n256 upvotes · 53 comments\nHyprscroller alternatives\nr/hyprland\n•\n10mo ago\nHyprscroller alternatives\n24 upvotes · 6 comments\nDE/WM that has tiling like hyprland and niri\nr/archlinux\n•\n28d ago\nDE/WM that has tiling like hyprland and niri\n11 comments\n[Hyprlad]Nixos with hyprland hyprscroller and hyprpanel\nr/hyprland\n•\n1y ago\n[Hyprlad]Nixos with hyprland hyprscroller and hyprpanel\n4\n187 upvotes · 10 comments\nNiri style navigation on hyprland.\nr/hyprland\n•\n7mo ago\nNiri style navigation on hyprland.\n26 upvotes · 13 comments\nMy setup -featuring hyprscrolling\nr/hyprland\n•\n2mo ago\nMy setup -featuring hyprscrolling\n13 upvotes · 6 comments\nNiri\nr/hyprland\n•\n1y ago\nNiri\n43 upvotes · 48 comments\nWhich one is best on arch hyprland vs niri\nr/hyprland\n•\n4mo ago\nWhich one is best on arch hyprland vs niri\n10 comments\nTried hyprland and it is hard\nr/hyprland\n•\n7mo ago\nTried hyprland and it is hard\n32 upvotes · 44 comments\nIs there any way to make Hyprland side scrolling like niri?\nr/hyprland\n•\n8mo ago\nIs there any way to make Hyprland side scrolling like niri?\n9 upvotes · 6 comments\nmy hyprscrolling removes gaps_out\nr/hyprland\n•\n20d ago\nmy hyprscrolling removes gaps_out\n0:22\n21 upvotes · 7 comments\nSearching for a stable \"Scrolling Tiling\" workflow in Hyprland (now that hyprscroller is unmaintained)\nr/hyprland\n•\n1mo ago\nSearching for a stable \"Scrolling Tiling\" workflow in Hyprland (now that hyprscroller is unmaintained)\n7 upvotes · 19 comments\nWhy did my screen hit me with \"Hyprland! :)\"?\nr/hyprland\n•\n6mo ago\nWhy did my screen hit me with \"Hyprland! :)\"?\n571 upvotes · 35 comments\nWhy does Hyprland have a :D next it in the hardware survey\nr/hyprland\n•\n5mo ago\nWhy does Hyprland have a :D next it in the hardware survey\n244 upvotes · 54 comments\nIs this kind of tiling possible with hyprland?\nr/hyprland\n•\n4d ago\nIs this kind of tiling possible with hyprland?\n1 upvote · 9 comments\nThis Noobs Brand New Experience with Hyprland\nr/hyprland\n•\n6mo ago\nThis Noobs Brand New Experience with Hyprland\n3\n208 upvotes · 36 comments\nFirefox glitching on hyprland when scrolling.\nr/hyprland\n•\n4mo ago\nFirefox glitching on hyprland when scrolling.\n3\n5 upvotes · 9 comments\nThis makes hyprland so much better!\nr/hyprland\n•\n2mo ago\nThis makes hyprland so much better!\n0:10\n382 upvotes · 44 comments\nVIEW POST IN\nहिन्दी\nРусский\n繁體中文\n简体中文\nFrançais\nPublic\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

Anything around 25% is just too small for me. Because of that, each Hyprland workspace could only fit 2 to 3 windows before feeling cramped, even with 10 workspaces.\n\nI initially thought about switching to NIRI, but after checking out the community, I saw many people using hyprscrolling. I decided to implement it, and I absolutely love it! Now, I organize my workspaces by context—for example, a 'Web' workspace for 3–5 related tabs, and a 'Code' workspace for everything dev-related. It’s much easier to maintain and remember everything this way.

Here's a succinct guide to help you understand the key differences and what might work best for you:\n\nFeatures and Workflow\n\nNiri\n\nBuilt-in Features: Niri includes built-in screenshots and an overview mode, which are highly praised. \"Niri has a whole bunch of features built-in that you only get on Hyprland with plugins or by stiching together other tools.\"\n\nScrolling Layout: Niri's scrolling window management is a standout feature, allowing for dynamic workspace management. \"I switched to Niri and it’s great. Scrolling means that separate workspaces can be utilised not just for different functions but entirely separate tasks altogether.\"\n\nTouchpad Controls: Niri offers intuitive touchpad controls, which is a big plus for laptop users. \"Trackpad controls are super intuitive, the community maintained Nix flake is great, and documentation is great.\"\n\nHyprland\n\nPlugin Ecosystem: Hyprland is known for its extensive plugin support, which allows for high customization. \"Hyprland has a scrolling plugin which I used for a while but it was kinda buggy.\"\n\nDwindle Layout: Hyprland's default dwindle layout is preferred by some users for its predictability. \"I haven't tried Niri but I just can't see how infinite scrolling is better than setting up discrete workspaces with everything in their correct place.\"\n\nXWayland Support: Hyprland has better built-in XWayland support compared to Niri. \"Comparing niri as a compositor with hyprland, it doesn't provide xwayland support by itself and lacks a plugin ecosystem.\"\n\nPerformance and Stability\n\nNiri\n\nSmoother Performance: Users have noted that Niri feels smoother and more performant, especially in gaming scenarios. \"Gaming for games like CS2 feels much more consistence... my GPU runs now cooler, game runs smoother.\"\n\nStability: Niri is often praised for its stability, which is a significant factor for daily use. \"I have found Niri much more stable compared to Hyprland but I last used Hyprland a year ago (or even more!).\"\n\nHyprland\n\nResource Intensity: Hyprland can be more resource-intensive, especially with many plugins. \"Ex-Hyprland user (switched because Hyprland was to resource intense).\"\n\nCompatibility Issues: Hyprland can sometimes have compatibility issues with plugins after updates. \"After updating Hyprland, the plugin broke.\"\n\nCustomization and Configuration\n\nNiri\n\nSimpler Configuration: Niri is noted for its simpler configuration compared to Hyprland. \"Configuring Hyprland requires at minimum, TRIPLE if not QUADRUPLE, the amount of effort it takes to configure niri.\"\n\nLess Customization: Niri has fewer customization options out of the box. \"Niri doesn't has that much eye candies but supports basic gradient color edge, which is enough for me.\"\n\nHyprland\n\nExtensive Customization: Hyprland offers extensive customization options, which can be a double-edged sword. \"Hyprland has been with us for a couple of years and has lots of customizability, options, and ideas about window managing stuff.\"\n\nComplex Configuration: Configuring Hyprland can be more complex due to its vast array of options. \"Hyprland may take a little more effort to setup but you can do everything niri does, even making it a scrollable wm.\"\n\nCommunity and Documentation\n\nNiri\n\nGrowing Community: Niri's community is growing, and the documentation is comprehensive. \"The community is nice and the documentation, like Hyprland’s is useful and gives plenty of examples.\"\n\nLess Mature: Being newer, Niri has fewer pre-made dotfiles and community resources. \"It's just new. So it has less premade dotfiles for folks to try out.\"\n\nHyprland\n\nMature Community: Hyprland has a more mature community with numerous dotfiles and tutorials available. \"There are lots of fancy dotfiles on Hyprland.\"\n\nExtensive Documentation: Hyprland's documentation is very thorough, which can be helpful for complex setups. \"The documentation, like Hyprland’s is useful and gives plenty of examples.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nChoosing between Niri and Hyprland depends on your priorities. If you value simplicity, stability, and a unique scrolling layout, Niri might be the better choice. If you prefer extensive customization and a rich plugin ecosystem, Hyprland could be more suitable.\n\nSubreddits for Further Questions\n\nr/wayland\n\nr/hyprland\n\nr/niri\n\nThese communities are great places to ask more specific questions and get personalized advice from experienced users.\n\nSee Answer\nBest Wayland compositors comparison\nHyprland features and advantages\nNiri vs Hyprland comparison\nSway vs i3 vs Hyprland comparison\nNew to Reddit?\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\nContinue with Email\nContinue With Phone Number\nBy continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy.\nMore posts you may like\nHyprland And Niri Changed Wayland Forever\nr/niri\n•\n5d ago\nHyprland And Niri Changed Wayland Forever\nyoutube\n114 upvotes · 27 comments\nWhy is everyone switching from Hyprland to Niri or River?\nr/hyprland\n•\n5mo ago\nWhy is everyone switching from Hyprland to Niri or River?\n63 comments\nTried Hyprscrolling on Hyprland — should I switch to Niri or just stick with this?\nr/hyprland\n•\n2mo ago\nTried Hyprscrolling on Hyprland — should I switch to Niri or just stick with this?\n26 upvotes · 20 comments\nWindow Compositor for Fedora: Hyperland vs Niri vs MangoWC\nr/Fedora\n•\n2mo ago\nWindow Compositor for Fedora: Hyperland vs Niri vs MangoWC\n8 upvotes · 14 comments\nOut of the Loop : What exactly happened between Hyprland, Vaxry and Freedesktop?\nr/linux4noobs\n•\n2y ago\nOut of the Loop : What exactly happened between Hyprland, Vaxry and Freedesktop?\n5 upvotes · 21 comments\nKDE >> hyprland/niri\nr/linux\n•\n2mo ago\nKDE >> hyprland/niri\n100 upvotes · 75 comments\nniri: A scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor\nr/linux\n•\n5mo ago\nniri: A scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor\ngithub\n75 upvotes · 11 comments\nWhat actually is Hyperland??\nr/linux4noobs\n•\n1y ago\nWhat actually is Hyperland??\n13 upvotes · 20 comments\nCan someone explain to me what Hyprland exactly is?\nr/hyprland\n•\n2y ago\nCan someone explain to me what Hyprland exactly is?\n256 upvotes · 53 comments\nniri v25.05: the all-new overview, and tons of other improvements\nr/linux\n•\n9mo ago\nniri v25.05: the all-new overview, and tons of other improvements\ngithub\n154 upvotes · 30 comments\nWhat is your favourite Hyprland dotfiles/configuration?\nr/hyprland\n•\n3y ago\nWhat is your favourite Hyprland dotfiles/configuration?\n125 upvotes · 76 comments\nFirst simple Hyprland rice after switching to Arch permanently :D\nr/hyprland\n•\n9mo ago\nFirst simple Hyprland rice after switching to Arch permanently :D\n7\n628 upvotes · 54 comments\nFound an old article about Bill Gates regarding Linux\nr/linux\n•\n3mo ago\nFound an old article about Bill Gates regarding Linux\n1.2K upvotes · 412 comments\nWhich one is best on arch hyprland vs niri\nr/archlinux\n•\n4mo ago\nWhich one is best on arch hyprland vs niri\n9 comments\nNiri\nr/hyprland\n•\n1y ago\nNiri\n43 upvotes · 48 comments\nDoes anyone actually use Hyprland for actual work, or is it just a glorified anime wallpaper with blur machine?\nr/hyprland\n•\n10mo ago\nDoes anyone actually use Hyprland for actual work, or is it just a glorified anime wallpaper with blur machine?\n267 upvotes · 228 comments\nHyprland is a toxic community\nr/linux\n•\n2y ago\nHyprland is a toxic community\n418 upvotes · 179 comments\nThis Noobs Brand New Experience with Hyprland\nr/hyprland\n•\n6mo ago\nThis Noobs Brand New Experience with Hyprland\n3\n208 upvotes · 36 comments\nWould you recommend Arch with Hyprland to a complete newbie?\nr/linux4noobs\n•\n5mo ago\nWould you recommend Arch with Hyprland to a complete newbie?\n4 upvotes · 45 comments\nHow well does niri work for gaming?\nr/linuxquestions\n•\n7mo ago\nHow well does niri work for gaming?\n6 upvotes · 7 comments\nWhere to change Hyprlan to start-hyprland\nr/hyprland\n•\n2mo ago\nWhere to change Hyprlan to start-hyprland\n3 upvotes · 8 comments\nIs hyperland worth it?\nr/archlinux\n•\n1y ago\nIs hyperland worth it?\n31 comments\nHow lightweight is Hyprland?\nr/hyprland\n•\n2y ago\nHow lightweight is Hyprland?\n39 upvotes · 49 comments\nFirst time using linux (and hyprland)!\nr/hyprland\n•\n5mo ago\nFirst time using linux (and hyprland)!\n0:28\n354 upvotes · 40 comments\nWhich one is best on arch hyprland vs niri\nr/hyprland\n•\n4mo ago\nWhich one is best on arch hyprland vs niri\n10 comments\nVIEW POST IN\nPortuguês (Brasil)\nहिन्दी\nFrançais\nPublic\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

It's a pretty useful handy dandy utility that allow that\nhandy dandy utility that allow that\nhandy dandy utility that allow that allows you to do this. So if I look for\nallows you to do this. So if I look for\nallows you to do this. So if I look for hyperland,\nhyperland,\nhyperland, you should see a git version pop up with\nyou should see a git version pop up with\nyou should see a git version pop up with chaotic a somewhere here. So chaotic a\nchaotic a somewhere here. So chaotic a\nchaotic a somewhere here. So chaotic a hyperland git. Now notice that it's\nhyperland git. Now notice that it's\nhyperland git.

I'm running it right now and it's great!\n\nWrite a reply\nedited\ncristian-fleischer\n\nI noticed this discussion is the most voted in the 'Ideas' category and 6th most voted over all.\nSo I thought I would share my attempt at solving exactly this request:\n\nhttps://github.com/cristian-fleischer/okimarchy\n\nDisclaimer: It's functional and usable, but certainly not finished. It's still a work in progress and some things still need to be addressed like some of the options in the Omarchy Menu not working as they are assuming we use Hyprland and I did not have the time to address them all.\n\nI also don't have a lot of time to invest in this little side quest, so if anyone has an interest in contributing and improving this fork please let me know.\n\nI will also create a pull request back to omarchy in case there is interest here.\n\nLater edit: This is the PR #2042\n\n2\n3\n3 replies\ncristian-fleischer\n\nSo it seems niri support will not be coming to omarchy, see @dhh's comments on the pull request I had opened (#2042).\nThe decision is understandable and honestly expected given omarchys philosophy.\n\nBut this at least clarifies the path for anybody interested in a niri flavored omarchy.\nCheck out my fork if you want to try a niri flavored omarchy that tries to keep everything about omarchy as is and just integrate niri as well as possible.\nAlso, if you are passionate about this, please consider contributing.\nhttps://github.com/cristian-fleischer/okimarchy\n\n4\n1\nthooams\n\nYes, I think he’s right, support 2 WM is too much, but I think your fork will have lot of fans.

I decided to fork sway and create a compatible compositor with hyprscroller layout and features.\n\nHyprland was starting to limit what I could add through a plugin. Updating hyprscroller because of Hyprland changes, and working around API limitations to implement new features was delaying development more than I wanted. Hyprscroller became too brittle and dependant on hacks. Changes upstream could break it very easily.\n\nI chose sway because it is a stable platform, well written, implements all the standard features and it is relatively easy to modify.\n\nNow Hyprscroller is completely integrated, and this allows some quite exciting features to work very easily.\n\nIf you are curious about the current state of the project, click here.\n\nHyprscroller\n\nHyprscroller is a Hyprland layout plugin that creates a window layout similar to PaperWM.\n\nThe plugin is quite feature complete and supports gaps, borders, decorations, special workspace, full screen modes, overview, marks, pinned columns, touchpad gestures, copying/pasting windows, trails/trailmarks, quick jump mode, and installation through hyprpm.\n\nCheck the Tutorial for a quick overview of hyprscroller's main features.\n\nI use hyprscroller on my main machine and will support it for as long as I keep on using Hyprland. However, I will only add new features that I find interesting, and support two Hyprland versions: the one my distribution uses, and the latest tagged one. I have found problematic compiling trunk versions of Hyprland on a system that already has a system-wide version of it installed, so I will not make an extra effort there until things improve in that front.\n\nRequirements\n\nhyprscroller supports the version of Hyprland I use, which should be the same as the Arch Linux hyprland package (v0.48.1). You can try your luck with the latest git changes, but I will be slower to keep up with those, as there are too many API changes going on upstream.\n\nAside from those two versions, even though the feature set will be frozen for them, hyprscroller also supports most official Hyprland releases from v0.35 to the current one.\n\nBuilding and installing\n\nThe easiest and recommended mode to install hyprscroller is through hyprpm\n\nhyprpm\nhyprpm add https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller\n# verify it installed correctly\nhyprpm list\n\nYou can enable or disable it via hyprpm enable hyprscroller and hyprpm disable hyprscroller or update it using hyprpm update hyprscroller.\n\nAdding exec-once = hyprpm reload -n to your hyprland.conf will ensure all your hyprpm managed plugins will be loaded at startup.\n\nManually\n\nIf you want to build the plugin manually, it should be as simple as running\n\n# builds a shared object hyprscroller.so\nmake all\n# installs the shared library in ~/.config/hypr/plugins\nmake install\n\nthen you can add the plugin to your hyprland.conf\n\n# path must be absolute\nplugin = /home/xxxx/.config/hypr/plugins/hyprscroller.so\n\n\nor load it temporarily using hyprctl plugin\n\n# path must be absolute\nhyprctl plugin load /home/xxxx/.config/hypr/plugins/hyprscroller.so\nNixOS\n\nhyprscroller is now an official unstable package in nixpkgs, so you can install it from there. I don't maintain flakes any more because they were usually very out of date and I don't know enough about NixOS to keep them alive. If you need a newer version than the NixOS package, I recommend you temporarily use hyprpm.\n\nConfiguration\n\nIf you are not using hyprpm, to make Hyprland load the plugin, add this to your configuration.\n\n# path must be absolute\nplugin = /home/xxxx/.config/hypr/plugins/hyprscroller.so\n\n\nInstead, if you use hyprpm, it should be as simple as adding this to your ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf :\n\nexec-once = hyprpm reload -n\n\n\nTo turn on the layout, use\n\ngeneral {\n    ...\n\n    layout = scroller\n\n    ...\n}\n\nDispatchers\n\nThe plugin adds the following dispatchers:\n\nDispatcher\tDescription\nscroller:movefocus\tAn optional replacement for movefocus, takes a direction as argument.\nscroller:movewindow\tAn optional replacement for movewindow, takes a direction and a movement mode as arguments.\nscroller:setmode\tSet mode: r/row (default), c/col/column. Sets the working mode. Affects most dispatchers and new window creation.\nscroller:setmodemodifier\tAssigns modifiers to the current mode for window creation: position, focus/nofocus, manual/auto.

Parameter similar to setwidth\nscroller:alignwindow\tAlign window on the screen, l/left, c/center, r/right (row mode), c/center, u/up, d/down (col mode), m/middle\nscroller:admitwindow\tAccepts an optional direction parameter (l/left (default) or r/right). Push the current window below the active one of the column in that direction.\nscroller:expelwindow\tAccepts an optional direction parameter (l/left or r/right (default)). Pop the current window out of its column and place it on a new column to the right or left.\nscroller:fitsize\tResize columns (row mode) or windows (col mode) so they fit on the screen: active, visible, all, toend, tobeg\nscroller:fitwidth\tResize columns so they fit on the screen: active, visible, all, toend, tobeg\nscroller:fitheight\tResize windows for the active column so they fit on the screen: active, visible, all, toend, tobeg\nscroller:toggleoverview\tToggle an overview of the workspace where all the windows are temporarily scaled to fit the monitor\nscroller:marksadd\tAdd a named mark. Argument is the name of the mark\nscroller:marksdelete\tDelete a named mark. Argument is the name of the mark\nscroller:marksvisit\tVisit a named mark. Argument is the name of the mark\nscroller:marksreset\tDelete all marks\nscroller:pin\tToggle pin a column to its current position. The rest will adapt when changing focus etc.\nscroller:selectiontoggle\tToggle on/off the selection status of a window\nscroller:selectionworkspace\tSelect every window in the current workspace\nscroller:selectionreset\tResets selection (deselects all windows)\nscroller:selectionmove\tMoves the selected windows/columns to the current workspace and location, takes a direction as argument (keeps sizes etc.)\nscroller:trailnew\tCreates a new trail\nscroller:traildelete\tDeletes the active trail\nscroller:trailclear\tClears all the trailmarks of the current trail\nscroller:trailnext\tMoves to next trail\nscroller:trailprevious\tMoves to previous trail\nscroller:trailtoselection\tCreates a selection from all the windows in the current trail\nscroller:trailmarktoggle\tToggles a trailmark for the current window in the active trail\nscroller:trailmarknext\tMoves to next trailmark in the current trail\nscroller:trailmarkprevious\tMoves to previous trailmark in the current trail\nscroller:jump\tShows every window on the active monitors for a shortcut-based, quick focus mode\nModes\n\nHyprscroller works in any of two modes that can be changed at any moment.\n\nrow mode: it is the default. It creates new windows in a new column. cyclesize and setsize affect the width of the active column. alignwindow aligns the active column according to the argument received. fitsize fits the selected columns to the width of the monitor.\n\ncolumn mode: It creates new windows in the current column, right below the active window. cyclesize and setsize affect the height of the active window. alignwindow aligns the active window within the column, according to the argument received. fitsize fits the selected windows in the column to the height of the monitor.\n\nMode Modifiers\n\nModes and mode modifiers are per row (workspace). Each row may have different values.\n\nAt window creation time, hyprscroller can apply several modifiers to the current working mode (row/column). The dispatcher scroller:setmodemodifier can set any of them by taking the following parameters:\n\nposition: It is one of after (default), before, end, beginning. This parameter decides the position of new windows: after the current one (default value), before the current one, at the end of the row/column, or at the beginning of the row/column.\nfocus: One of focus (default) or nofocus. When creating a new window, this parameter decides whether it will get focus or not.\nAutomatic mode: manual (default) or auto. In the default manual mode, you control window placement. When turning on auto, hyprscroller will work in grid mode automatically. auto accepts an extra parameter: number. In row mode, hyprscroller will wait for as many new windows as number per column before creating a new column. In column mode, hyprscroller will create as many as number columns before adding new windows to any of them. If you close any window, auto mode will start filling the gaps with new windows you create.\ncenter_column/nocenter_column: It will keep the active column centered (or not) on the screen. The default value is the one in your configuration. See center_active_column.\ncenter_window/nocenter_window: It will keep the active window centered (or not) in its column. The default value is the one in your configuration. See center_active_window.\n\nYou can skip any number of parameters when calling the dispatcher, and their order doesn't matter.\n\nYou can change modifiers at any time using scoller:setmodemodifier, which works like this:\n\n# scroller:setmodemodifier, position, focus, auto:number, center_column, center_window\n# examples\nhyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier before, nofocus, auto:3\n# creates new windows at the end of the row/column and doesn't focus on them\nhyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier end, nofocus\n# sets manual mode with no focus on new windows\nhyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier , nofocus, manual\n# default values\nhyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier after, focus, manual\n# sets auto mode with a grid of 4 windows\nhyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier , auto:4\n# keeps the active column always centered\nhyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier , center_column\n\n\nYou can skip any parameters. If you don't specify some of them, they will merge with the current set.\n\nAdd a submap to your key bindings configuration to use this feature more easily:\n\n# Set Mode Modifiers submap\n# will switch to a submap called modifiers\nbind = $mainMod, backslash, submap, modifiers\n# will start a submap called \"modifiers\"\nsubmap = modifiers\n#\nbind = , right, scroller:setmodemodifier, after\nbind = , right, submap, reset\nbind = , left, scroller:setmodemodifier, before\nbind = , left, submap, reset\nbind = , home, scroller:setmodemodifier, beginning\nbind = , home, submap, reset\nbind = , end, scroller:setmodemodifier, end\nbind = , end, submap, reset\nbind = , up, scroller:setmodemodifier, , focus\nbind = , up, submap, reset\nbind = , down, scroller:setmodemodifier, , nofocus\nbind = , down, submap, reset\nbind = , 2, scroller:setmodemodifier, , , auto, 2\nbind = , 2, submap, reset\nbind = , 3, scroller:setmodemodifier, , , auto, 3\nbind = , 3, submap, reset\nbind = , m, scroller:setmodemodifier, , , manual\nbind = , m, submap, reset\n# use reset to go back to the global submap\nbind = , escape, submap, reset\n# will reset the submap, meaning end the current one and return to the global one\nsubmap = reset\n\n\nThere is also an IPC event with details of the current mode and modifiers. Read this for an example\n\nYou can also set a window rule for each new window to follow a certain combination of mode and mode modifiers. See window rules for more details.\n\nWindow/Column Focus and Movement\n\nHyprscroller is now compatible with Hyprland's default movefocus/movewindow dispatchers and key bindings. But you can also add Hyprscroller's own scroller:movefocus/scroller:movewindow for cases unsupported by Hyprland, like beginning and end. Supporting the default dispatcher allows for better switching of layouts without needing to modify the configuration, which was the case in the past.\n\nmovefocus and movewindow accept the following directional arguments: l or left, r or right, u or up, d or dn or down, b or begin or beginning, e or end. So you can focus or move windows/columns in a direction or to the beginning or end or the row.\n\nAdditionally, movewindow accepts an additional, optional, parameter: nomode If nomode is added to the dispatcher, movement will only move the active window, leaving its column intact, regardless of which mode (row/column) you are currently in. The movement will be like this:\n\nIf the window is in some column with other windows, any left or right movement will expel it to that side, creating a new column with just that window. Moving it again will admit it in the column in the direction of movement, and so on. Moving the window up or down will simply move it in its current column.\n\nResizing\n\ncyclesize accepts an argument which is either +1/1/next, or -1/prev/previous. It cycles forward or backward through a number of column widths (in row mode), or window heights (in column mode). Those widths or heights are a fraction of the width or height of the monitor, and are configurable (see options). However, using Hyprland's own dispatchers resizeactive or resizewindowpixel, you can still modify the width or height of any window freely.\n\ncyclewidth is like cyclesize, but cycle-sizes the width of the column, regardless of which mode you are in. cycleheight works similarly, but resizing the active window's height.\n\nsetsize, setwidth and setheight are similar to their cycle... counterparts, but instead of cycling, they set the width or height directly. These dispatchers accept either an integer parameter, or a string. If the parameter is an integer, it means an index, which is the zero-based index in the column_widths array for setwidth, or setsize in row mode, or the index in window_heights for setheight, or setsize in column mode. If the parameter is a string containing one of the standard sizes, it sets the column/window width/height to that fractional value (even if it is not within your default sizes).\n\nplugin {\n    scroller {\n        column_widths = onethird onehalf twothirds one\n        window_heights = onethird onehalf twothirds one\n    }\n}\nbind = $mainMod, 1, scroller:setwidth, 0  # sets width to onethird\nbind = $mainMod, 2, scroller:setwidth, 1  # sets width to onehalf\nbind = $mainMod, 3, scroller:setwidth, 2  # ...\nbind = $mainMod, 4, scroller:setwidth, 3\n...\nbind = $mainMod SHIFT, 1, scroller:setheight, 0  # sets height to onethird\nbind = $mainMod SHIFT, 2, scroller:setheight, 1  # sets height to onehalf\nbind = $mainMod SHIFT, 3, scroller:setheight, 2  # ...\nbind = $mainMod SHIFT, 4, scroller:setheight, 3\nbind = $mainMod SHIFT, 5, scroller:setheight, oneeighth  # sets the height to oneeighth directly\n...\n\nAligning\n\nColumns are generally aligned in automatic mode, always making the active one visible, and trying to make at least the previously focused one visible too if it fits the viewport, if not, the one adjacent on the other side. However, you can always align any column to the center, left or right of the monitor (in row mode), or up (top), down (bottom) or to the center in column mode. For example center a column for easier reading, regardless of what happens to the other columns. As soon as you change focus or move a column, the alignment is lost. You can also center a window on your workspace using middle, it will center its column, and also the window within the column.\n\nalignwindow takes a parameter: l or left, r or right, c or center or centre, u or up, d or down, and m or middle.\n\nTo use right or left you need to be in row mode, and to use up or down in column mode. center behaves differently depending on the mode. In row mode it aligns the active column to the center of the monitor. In column mode, it aligns the active window within its column, to a centered position. If you want to center a window and its column at the same time, regardless of which mode you are in, use middle.\n\nAdmit/Expel\n\nYou can create columns of windows using admitwindow. It takes an optional direction parameter l/left (default) or r/right. The dispatcher takes the active window and moves it to the column in the parameter direction from its current one, right under the active window in that column.\n\nTo expel any window from its current column and position it in a new column to its right or left, use expelwindow. It also takes the same l/left or r/right (default) parameter.\n\nFitting the Screen\n\nWhen you have a ultra-wide monitor, one in a vertical position, or the default column widths or window heights don't fit your workflow, you can use manual resizing, but it is sometimes slow and tricky.\n\nscroller:fitsize works in two different ways, depending on the active mode.\n\nIt allows you to re-fit the columns (row mode) or windows (column mode) you want to the screen extents. It accepts an argument related to the columns/windows it will try to fit. The new width/height of each column/window will be proportional to its previous width or height, relative to the other columns or windows affected.\n\nactive: It is similar to maximize, it will fit the active column/window.\nvisible: All the currently fully or partially visible columns/windows will be resized to fit the screen.\nall: All the columns in the row or windows in the column will be resized to fit.\ntoend: All the columns or windows from the focused one to the end of the row/column will be affected.\ntobeg or tobeginning: All the columns/windows from the focused one to the beginning of the row/column will now fit the screen.\n\nfitwidth and fitheight accept the same arguments as fitsize, but work for the current row (fitwidth) or the active column (fitheight), regardless of your current row/column mode. They provide a direct way to fit windows without having to change the current working mode.\n\nOverview\n\nscroller:toggleoverview toggles a bird's eye view of the current workspace where all the windows are scaled to fit the current monitor. You can still interact with the windows normally (change focus, move windows, create or destroy them, type in them etc.). Use it as a way to see where things are and move the active focus, or reposition windows. You can even have all your windows in full screen mode and use overview to navigate among them quickly.\n\nOverview is affected by the option overview_scale_content, which is by default true, meaning the windows' content will be scaled in the same proportion as the windows. If your system doesn't support this (currently only supported on x86_64 -Intel/AMD CPUs), the default value will be false. If you simply want to have the content at the original size, you can also turn this option manually to false.\n\nJump\n\nscroller:jump provides a shortcut-based quick focus mode for any window on the active workspaces, similar to vim-easymotion and variations.\n\nIt shows all the windows on your monitors' active workspaces in overview, and waits for a combination of key presses (overlaid on each window) to quickly change focus to the selected window. Pressing any key that is not on the list or a combination that doesn't exist, exits jump mode without changes.\n\nDepending on the total number of windows and keys you set on your list, you will have to press more or less times. Each window has its full combination on the overlay.\n\nYou can call jump from any mode: overview, full screen or normal mode.\n\nThere are four options related to scroller:jump: plugin:scroller:jump_labels_font, plugin:scroller:jump_labels_color, plugin:scroller:jump_labels_scale and plugin:scroller:jump_labels_keys. These options are explained in detail in Options.\n\nMarks\n\nYou can use marks to navigate to frequently used windows, regardless of which workspace they are in (it even works for the special workspace windows).\n\nscroller:marksadd adds a named mark. Use a submap to create bindings for several named marks you may want to use. See the configuration example for directions.\n\nscroller:marksdelete deletes a named mark created with scroller:marksadd.\n\nscroller:marksvisit moves the focus to a previously created mark.\n\nscroller:marksreset clears all marks.\n\nMarks reference windows, but are global, they may belong to different workspaces, so visiting a mark may switch workspaces.\n\nYou can use any string name for a mark, for example in scripts. But they are also very convenient to use with regular key bindings by simply using a letter as the name. Again, see the example configuration.\n\nhyprscroller generates IPC signals for mark events, and in this README there is an example implementation for ags to use those signals to display information on your desktop bar.\n\nIf you want more advanced functionality for marks, including some nice UI to view which ones are set and navigate them, see this script and comment by CRAG666\n\nPinning a Column\n\nscroller:pin manages pinned columns (toggles pinned status). Having a column pinned is useful to keep some column as an immovable reference; for example some documentation or important code you want to always have available while changing focus to other columns.\n\nscroller:pin will pin a column if none is pinned, otherwise will unpin the pinned one. So to move the pin from one column to another, call scroller:pin twice, one to unpin the currently pinned one, and the second to pin the active column.\n\nThere can only be one pinned column per workspace. The column will stay in place while the flag is on. That means the rest of the columns (even the active one) will not perturb that position. When changing focus, the active column will be seen on the screen as long as it fits on either side of the pinned column.\n\nhyprscroller sets a special tag (scroller:pinned) on windows belonging to a pinned column. You can use this tag to create window rules affecting these windows. For example, to change their border colors:\n\nwindowrulev2 = bordercolor rgb(eeee00) rgb(00eeee), tag: scroller:pinned\n\nWindow Copying/Pasting\n\nscroller:selectiontoggle and scroller:selectionreset manage window/column selections. You can select several windows at a time, even in different workspaces and/or from overview mode. Those windows will change the border color to the one specified in the option plugin:scroller:col.selection_border.\n\nOnce you have made a selection, you can move those windows to a different workspace or location in the same workspace using scroller:selectionmove. The selection order and column/window configuration will be maintained.\n\nscroller:selectionworkspace will add every window of the current workspace to the selection. You can use this when you want to move one workspace to a different one, but keeping windows positions and sizes. Use scroller:selectionworkspace, and then scroller:selectionmove where you want the windows to appear.\n\nscroller:selectionmove accepts a direction as parameter. Valid directions are:\n\nr or right: Move the selection to the current workspace, locating it right of the active column.\nl or left: Move the selection to the current workspace, locating it left of the active column.\nb, begin, or beginning: Move the selection to the current workspace, locating it at the beginning (first column).\ne or end: Move the selection to the current workspace, locating it at the end (last column).\nTrails and Trailmarks\n\nTrails and Trailmarks are a concept borrowed from trailblazer.nvim.\n\nA trailmark is like an anonymous mark on a window, and a trail is a collection of trailmarks. You can have as many trails as you want, and as many trailmarks as you want in any trail. Each window can be in as many trails as you want too.\n\nCreating your first trailmark (trailmarktoggle) will create a trail. From then on, every trailmark you create will be assigned to that trail. You can navigate back (trailmarkprevious) and forth (trailmarknext) within the collection of trailmarks contained in the trail.\n\nTo create a new trail, use trailnew. With trailprevious and trailnext you can navigate trails, changing the active one. The active trail will be the one used for the trailmark dispatchers (toggle, next, and previous).\n\nClear all the trailmarks of the active trail using trailclear, or delete the trail from the list with traildelete.\n\ntrailtoselection creates a selection list from the trailmarks in the active trail. You can use that selection for example to move all the windows to a new workspace using selectionmove.\n\nhyprscroller generates IPC signals for trail/trailmark events, and in this README there is an example implementation for ags to use those signals to display information on your desktop bar.\n\nSee the key bindings section for an example on how to set bindings for trail and trailmark dispatchers.\n\nTouchpad Gestures\n\nThere are options to enable/disable touchpad gestures for scrolling, overview and workspace change.\n\nThe default for scrolling is swiping with three fingers to scroll left, right, up or down. Four fingers up enables the overview mode, down disables it. To change workspace, swipe right or left, also with four fingers.\n\nWhen swiping vertically (a column), hyprscroller will scroll the column that contains the mouse pointer. This allows you to scroll columns that are not the active one if your Hyprland input:follow_mouse setting decouples focusing from mouse pointer position (value other than 1). Read Hyprland's Wiki for more details.\n\nYou can enable/disable any of the three gestures. But if you want to have the three enabled, note that scrolling needs the two axes, horizontal and vertical, while overview only uses the vertical, and workspace switching the horizontal axis. That means, you will want to share _fingers (see Options) for overview and workspace switching, while leaving scrolling on its own _fingers value. The default accounts for that, so leave it as it is unless your touchpad supports gestures with more fingers and you want to use that.\n\nhyprscroller touchpad gestures respect the global option input:touchpad:natural_scroll and provide several others specific to the plugin to tweak gestures behavior. You can find them in the Options section of this document.\n\nNote: Hyprland's workspace_swipe will be disabled while using hyprscroller. Please, use the provided workspace change swipe gesture (four fingers right/left by default, but you can change the number of fingers).\n\nHyprland doesn't understand windows in a workspace can exist outside of the viewport, so workspace_swipe will not work, as it renders those windows thinking they are in a different workspace, creating a small mess of windows. If you have forgotten to disable it, hyprscroller will have to turn off three finger gestures until you disable workspace_swipe.\n\nIPC\n\nhyprscroller sends IPC messages in certain situations, in the same way hyprland does.

Possible arguments are: oneeighth, onesixth, onefourth, onethird, threeeighths, onehalf (default), fiveeighths, twothirds, threequarters, fivesixths, seveneighths, one.\n\nwindow_default_height\n\nDetermines the default height of a new window. This is useful if you are using a monitor in portrait mode and column mode. Possible arguments are: oneeighth, onesixth, onefourth, onethird, threeeighths, onehalf, fiveeighths, twothirds, threequarters, fivesixths, seveneighths, one (default).\n\nfocus_wrap\n\nDetermines whether focus will wrap when at the first or last window of a row/column. Possible arguments are: true|1 (default), or false|0.\n\nfocus_edge_ms\n\nWhen your Hyprland setting for input:follow_mouse is 0 or 1, Hyprland will change focus to the window where your mouse cursor is. hyprscroller can have windows outside of the viewport. If your gaps_out setting allows you to see part of those windows, mouse focusing can trigger a refocus when your mouse is over the gap at the edge of the monitor. This can sometimes create a series of unwanted focusing events that move focus away, and can be quite distracting.\n\nfocus_edge_ms is a timeout value (default is 400 ms). When your mouse is over the edge of the monitor's gap, refocusing on the window under that gap will be delayed for this time value. If you didn't want to focus, you can still escape! If you actually want to scroll and focus, keep the mouse inside the gap for the timeout value. On your next mouse movement, hyprscroller will scroll to the partially seen window. Note you need to move your mouse again after the timeout value, this is attached to the mouseMove event, so even if you keep the mouse over the gap for longer than the timeout, the event won't be triggered until your next mouse movement. The easiest way to scroll is to flick the mouse inside and outside of the gap to make sure you only scroll once.\n\ncyclesize_wrap\n\nIf true, cyclesize, cyclewidth and cycleheight will cycle through all the respective sizes defined in column_widths and window_heights infinitely, in a cycle. This is the default behavior. If you prefer cycling not to wrap (just one cycle), set this option to 0/false. Cycling will then stop at the first size if you call prev, and at the last size if you call next. Possible arguments are: true|1 (default), or false|0.\n\ncyclesize_closest\n\nIf true, when a window/column has been manually resized or is not of one of the standard sizes in window_heights/column_widths, calling one of the cyclesize dispatchers will resize it to the closest available size in window_heights/column_widths. If false, the window/column will adopt its default size instead (window_default_height/column_default_width). Possible arguments are: true|1 (default), or false|0.\n\ncenter_row_if_space_available\n\nIf there is empty space in the viewport, the row will be centered, leaving the same amount of empty space on each side (respecting gaps_out). Possible arguments are: false|0 (default), or true|1.\n\ncenter_active_column\n\nIt true, the active column will always be centered on the screen. Possible values for the argument are: false|0 (default), or true|1.\n\ncenter_active_window\n\nIt true, the active window (active window of the active column) will always be centered on the screen. Possible values for the argument are: false|0 (default), or true|1.\n\noverview_scale_content\n\nScales the content of the windows in overview mode, like GNOME/MacOS/Windows overview mode. Possible arguments are: true|1 (default), or false|0.\n\ncol.selection_border\n\nIt is the color of the border of selected windows. The default value is 0xff9e1515, which is red.\n\njump_labels_font\n\nIt is a string with the font to use for jump labels. If omitted, the default is to use whatever you have set as default for Hyprland (misc:font_family).\n\njump_labels_color\n\nColor of the text for the jump labels. The default is 0x80159e30, which is a tone of green.\n\njump_labels_scale\n\njump labels will be centered in each window, and this parameter scales their size. The default is 0.5. 1.0 would make the label fit the full size of the window, and it's the maximum allowed, 0.1 is the minimum allowed, and would make the label's box size 10% of the width and height of the window.\n\njump_labels_keys\n\nIt is a string with the keys that will be used for the labels. The default is 1234, which means labels will show a unique combination of 1, 2, 3 and 4. The more keys you set on this option, the shorter the combination of key presses to reach any window, but some times, reaching for those keys can be slower. Some people prefer to use qwerasdf which provides a shorter label and good reachability. The perfect combination depends on how you use your keyboard.\n\ncolumn_widths\n\nDetermines the set of column widths hyprscroller will cycle through when resizing the width of a column in row mode. It is a string of any number of values chosen among: oneeighth, onesixth, onefourth, onethird, threeeighths, onehalf, fiveeighths, twothirds, threequarters, fivesixths, seveneighths, one. The default value is: onethird onehalf twothirds one.\n\nwindow_heights\n\nDetermines the set of window heights hyprscroller will cycle through when resizing the height of a window in column mode. It is a string of any number of values chosen among: oneeighth, onesixth, onefourth, onethird, threeeighths, onehalf, fiveeighths, twothirds, threequarters, fivesixths, seveneighths, one. The default value is: onethird onehalf twothirds one.\n\nmonitor_options\n\nNOTE: This option deprecates monitor_modes. Please, update your configuration if you are using it.\n\nmonitor_options can be used to define different default options for each monitor. Currently, the supported options are:\n\nmode: r/row for row mode and c/col/column for column mode.\ncolumn_default_width: Possible values are the same as the global column_default_width option.\nwindow_default_height: Possible values are the same as the global window_default_height option.\ncolumn_widths: Similar to the global option.\nwindow_heights: Similar to the global option.\n\nWhen you create a workspace in any monitor, instead of defaulting to the global options, it will read them from this configuration value. For any monitor or option not defined in this variable, the option will default to the global one.\n\nMonitor names can be inferred by running hyprctl monitors and using the returned names.\n\nMonitor HDMI-A-1 (ID 0):\n\t3840x2160@59.99700 at 0x0\n    ...\n\n\nmeans the name you need to use is HDMI-A-1.\n\nmonitor_options is a list with the following format:\n\nmonitor_options = (DP-2 = (mode = row; column_default_width = onehalf; column_widths = onethird onehalf twothirds; window_default_height = one), HDMI-A-1 = (mode = col; column_default_width = one; window_default_height = onehalf))\n\n\nThe list of monitors is encapsulated by () and separated by ,. Each monitor entry consists of the name of the monitor followed by = and a list of options enclosed by (), with each option separated by ;, as in the example above. Spaces are allowed anywhere for better readability.\n\nThis option is useful to configure ultra-wide monitors or those in non-standard orientations (for example portrait instead of landscape). You can define any combination. You can also use a configuration per monitor when you have very different geometries, for example a laptop and an external, bigger monitor.\n\ngesture_sensitivity\n\nThis is a positive floating point value. The default is 1.0. If you want to make scrolling more sensitive, increase the value (2.0 for example). If it is too sensitive, try using a fraction of 1.0 (0.5 for example).\n\ngesture_scroll_enable\n\ntrue (default) or false. Enables or disables touchpad gestures for scrolling (changing focus).\n\ngesture_scroll_fingers\n\nInteger value, default is 3. Number of fingers used to swipe when scrolling.\n\ngesture_overview_enable\n\ntrue (default) or false. Enables or disables touchpad gestures to call overview mode.\n\ngesture_overview_fingers\n\nInteger value, default is 4. Number of fingers used to swipe for overview.\n\nIf you want to use gestures for both overview and workspace switch, you should set the same _fingers value for both. overview will use the vertical axis and workspace switch the horizontal one. If you set a different number of fingers for each, make sure your touchpad accepts gestures with that number of fingers.\n\ngesture_overview_distance\n\nInteger value, default is 5. Delta generated by swiping to call overview mode. It is like a sensitivity value; the smaller, the easier it will be to trigger the command. Each swipe triggers it only once, regardless of the length or the swipe.\n\ngesture_workspace_switch_enable\n\ntrue (default) or false. Enables or disables touchpad gestures for workspace switching.\n\ngesture_workspace_switch_fingers\n\nInteger value, default is 4. Number of fingers used to swipe for a workspace change.\n\nIf you want to use gestures for both overview and workspace switch, you should set the same _fingers value for both. overview will use the vertical axis and workspace switch the horizontal one. If you set a different number of fingers for each, make sure your touchpad accepts gestures with that number of fingers.\n\ngesture_workspace_switch_distance\n\nInteger value, default is 5. Delta generated by swiping to change workspace. It is like a sensitivity value; the smaller, the easier it will be to trigger the command. Each swipe triggers it only once, regardless of the length or the swipe.\n\ngesture_workspace_switch_prefix\n\nString value (one character). The default is \"\". It is the prefix used when calling the dispatcher to switch to a different workspace. Read Workspaces in the Hyprland wiki to understand in detail what each prefix means.\n\nThe prefix value will be concatenated to +1 or -1 to change workspace when swiping to one side or the other. For example:\n\n# Default: swith to the next/previous workspace, regardless of monitor\nplugin:scroller:gesture_workspace_switch_prefix =\n# swith to a workspace on the current monitor\nplugin:scroller:gesture_workspace_switch_prefix = m\n# swith to a workspace on the current monitor, including empty workspaces\nplugin:scroller:gesture_workspace_switch_prefix = r\n# swith to the next/previous open workspace\nplugin:scroller:gesture_workspace_switch_prefix = e\n\nOptions Example\nplugin {\n    scroller {\n        column_default_width = onehalf\n        focus_wrap = false\n        # ultra-wide monitor\n        column_widths = onefourth onethird onehalf onesixth\n        # portrait mode monitors\n        monitor_options = (DP-2 = (mode = row; column_default_width = onehalf; column_widths = onethird onehalf twothirds one; window_default_height = one), HDMI-A-1 = (mode = col; column_default_width = one; window_default_height = onehalf))\n    }\n}\n\nWindow Rules\n\nhyprscroller provides a number of static Window Rules v2 that can be triggered at window creation time.\n\nAside from those, hyprscroller also sets some properties on certain windows, so you can also apply general Hyprland rules to them.\n\nHyprland's Wiki explains what Window Rules are, and how to enable and configure them.\n\nStatic Window Rules\n\nThese are rules specific to hyprscroller\n\nmodemodifier\n\nUse this rule when you want to open a certain window overriding the current mode or its modifiers. This doesn't change the mode or its modifiers, it only affects the window matching the rule.\n\nSyntax of rule: plugin:scroller:modemodifier row|column after|before|end|beginning focus|nofocus\n\nFor example, the following rule will always open kitty windows in column mode, before the active window and won't focus on the new window.\n\nwindowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:modemodifier col before nofocus, class:(kitty)\n\ngroup\n\nYou may want to keep every window of the same class, type etc. in the same column. For example, in #45, a user wants to open all the plot windows for a Python script in the same column.\n\nSyntax of rule: plugin:scroller:group group_name\n\nwindowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:group python_plots, class:(python3)\n\nalignwindow\n\nAligns the new opened window. Works in the same way as the alignwindow dispatcher.\n\nSyntax of rule: plugin:scroller:alignwindow position\n\nCenter any new Firefox window.\n\nwindowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:alignwindow center, class:(firefox)\n\nmarksadd\n\nAdd a named mark to a window.\n\nSyntax of rule: plugin:scroller:marksadd name\n\nAdd a mark named m to Thunderbird's main window as soon as it's opened. This will let you navigate to Thunderbird from wherever you are by using a marksvisit key binding. I use Super + ' + m to set the focus on Thunderbird.\n\nwindowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:marksadd m, class:(thunderbird),title:(Mozilla Thunderbird)$\n\ncolumnwidth\n\nOverrides the default width of the column containing the window.\n\nSyntax of rule: plugin:scroller:columnwidth width\n\nOpen any Firefox window with a width of twothirds\n\nwindowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:columnwidth twothirds, class:(firefox)\n\nwindowheight\n\nOverrides the default height of the new window.\n\nSyntax of rule: plugin:scroller:windowheight height\n\nOpen any Firefox window with a height of onehalf\n\nwindowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:windowheight onehalf, class:(firefox)\n\nHyprscroller Properties for Window Rules\n\nhyprscroller allows you to apply general window rules to some of its windows by using tags. These are automatic tags hyprscroller sets:\n\nscroller:pinned\n\nWindows belonging to a pinned column are tagged scroller:pinned. You can use this tag to modify their behavior. For example, to change their border colors:\n\nwindowrulev2 = bordercolor rgb(eeee00) rgb(00eeee), tag: scroller:pinned\n\nKey bindings\n\nAs an example, you could set some key bindings in your hyprland.conf like this:\n\n# Move focus with mainMod + arrow keys\nbind = $mainMod, left, movefocus, l\nbind = $mainMod, right, movefocus, r\nbind = $mainMod, up, movefocus, u\nbind = $mainMod, down,

Licence CC By‑SA.\nÉtiquettes : waylandhyprlandc++swaycwlrootsaquamarine\n48\n19\nmar.\n2025\nCe journal a été promu en dépêche : Hyprland, un compositeur Wayland « tiling ».\nSommaire\nGestion des fenêtres\nConfiguration, doc, outils\nAspects techniques, conclusion\nConclusion\n\nHyprland est un compositeur Wayland \"tiling\" créé par Vaxri. Si vous n'avez aucune idée de ce que cela signifie, un compositeur inclut des fonctionnalités de gestion de fenêtres. D'autres compositeurs Wayland incluent GNOME, KDE et ceux basés sur wlroots\n\nAvant cela, Vaxri avait créé Hypr, qui fonctionnait sous Xorg et utilisait XCB, tout en adoptant une philosophie similaire en matière de gestion des fenêtres. Revenons à Hyprland : c'est un \"compositeur moderne avec du style\" pour traduire leur formulation. La dernière version est la v0.47.2 (une mise à jour mineure), la v0.47 datant de janvier 2025. Il existe des paquets officiels pour Arch et NixOS, mais le site fournit des instructions pour l'installer ailleurs. Je l'ai testé sur Arch, j'ai voulu me faire une idée et j'ai trouvé que ça valait le coup de partager l'expérience.\n\nNotez que Hyprland est principalement un compositeur avec des fonctionnalités de gestion des fenêtres, mais pas un environnement de bureau complet. Plus de détails sur ça plus tard.\n\nD'après le site officiel : \"Hyprland fournit les dernières fonctionnalités de Wayland, un tiling dynamique, de nombreux effets visuels, des plugins puissants et bien plus, tout en restant léger et réactif\". Sans surprise, son créateur apprécie tout ce qui touche à l'esthétique graphique.\n\nAh, l'apparence!… a probablement beaucoup contribué à faire connaître Hyprland. D'après les sondages du créateur, r/unixporn a été l'un des principaux vecteurs de sa popularité. J'aime aussi, dans une certaine mesure, les effets visuels et j'apprécie l'effort fait en ce sens : de beaux espacements, des bordures, des animations. Nous avons tous joué avec Compiz quelques minutes… avant de le jeter à la poubelle car ça ne sert à rien. Heureusement, Hyprland ne se limite pas à l'esthétique, et lorsque nous travaillons quotidiennement sur un ordinateur, nous pouvons apprécier son autre atout : la configurabilité. Vous pouvez utiliser plusieurs fichiers de configuration ou un seul, mais tout passe par fichier texte.\n\nPetit détail : modifiez le fichier texte config, enregistrez-le et votre configuration se recharge automatiquement à chaud. Simple détail, mais agréable. Si vous faites une erreur de syntaxe, un bandeau apparaîtra et affichera les erreurs qui empêchent le rechargement. Il vous suffira alors de corriger et de sauvegarder à nouveau.\n\nGestion des fenêtres\n\nPour comprendre la personnalisation, il faut d'abord comprendre les bases. Hyprland est un gestionnaire en mosaïque. Par défaut, il utilise le layout \"Dwindle\", qui était déjà utilisé par le gestionnaire de fenêtres BSPWM. La description la plus courte de ce layout serait : \"Pensez Fibonacci !\"\n\nBon appliqué à des fenêtres… voilà un extrait du README de BSPWM\n\n                 a                          a                          a\n                / \\                        / \\                        / \\\n               1   b         --->         1   c         --->         1   d\n                  / \\                        / \\                        / \\\n                 2   3                      4   b                      5   c\n                 ^                          ^  / \\                     ^  / \\\n                                              3   2                      b   4\n                                                                        / \\\n                                                                       3   2\n\n     +-----------------------+  +-----------------------+  +-----------------------+\n     |           |           |  |           |           |  |           |           |\n     |           |     2     |  |           |     4     |  |           |     5     |\n     |           |     ^     |  |           |     ^     |  |           |     ^     |\n     |     1     |-----------|  |     1     |-----------|  |     1     |-----------|\n     |           |           |  |           |     |     |  |           |  3  |     |\n     |           |     3     |  |           |  3  |  2  |  |           |-----|  4  |\n     |           |           |  |           |     |     |  |           |  2  |     |\n     +-----------------------+  +-----------------------+  +-----------------------+\n\n                 X                          Y                          Z\n\n\nUn autre layout standard est \"master\". Vous pouvez modifier votre fichier de configuration pour l'utiliser à la place ou même assigner une touche pour basculer entre eux. Le layout master fonctionne avec une fenêtre occupant la moitié de l'écran, tandis que les autres s'empilent sur l'autre moitié. Vous pouvez également changer la fenêtre maître.\n\nBon cette fois partageons les gifs enragés du wiki de Hyprland :\n\nHyprland offre aussi des fonctionnalités de gestion des fenêtres, communes aux différents layout :\n* Plusieurs espaces de travail (avec placement manuel ou automatique des fenêtres)\n* Un espace de travail spécial\n* Un système de \"groupement\", permettant de regrouper et dégrouper des fenêtres\n* Mode plein écran\n* Fenêtres flottantes\n\nHyprland propose aussi un système de plugins. Et devinez quoi, un plugin a été développé pour ajouter le layout de i3 (i3 étant un WM tiling sous Xorg, dont l'équivalent sous Wayland est Sway, qui est dév par Drew DeVault). Ce plugin s'appelle hy3. Dans i3, il y a des conteneurs, en gros c'est un layout \"manuel avec des découpages horizontaux/verticaux, très simple et efficace, et la doc i3 est très bien. Parce que la doc Sway, ce sont just des man page, ok c'est très bien aussi passons… Bref voilà maintenant j'ai un compositeur i3 avec des gaps et de belles animations, vous vous souvenez de i3-gaps - qui a entre temps été intégré à i3. Bref ça en mieux.\n\nConfiguration, doc, outils\n\nNotez que d'autres plugins existent, pour les animations, pour changer des comportements. La communauté pourrait être un bel axe de développement maintenant que d'après l'auteur le code se calme.\n\nA un moment un gestionnaire de plugin a été ajouté, hyprpm (pm package manager je suppose). Alors j'ai essayé d'installer hy3 avec mais j'ai rencontré des soucis de versions me rappelant le bon vieux temps où les dév de plugins gnome-shell hurlaient comme des putois quand une nouvelle version sortait. Bon bref j'ai compilé hy3 à la main à la place, mais sortez cpp et une bonne tasse de café, c'est pas juste un script emacs en lisp qui prend 3 secondes. Mais au moins ça a bien marché.\n\nSinon la configuration permet de personnaliser le layout clavier, la résolution d'écran, l'esthétique et les animations. Beaucoup de possibilités, par ex. pour les raccourcis on peut faire des \"submap\" (oui je sais, i3 aussi). On peut modifier plein de choses sans redémarrer.\n\nOn peut aussi utiliser la commande hyprctl pour communiquer avec hypr.\n\nCôté documentation, l'API technique est très bien couverte, mais il manque une documentation simplifiée pour une prise en main rapide. Et puis de base ne vous attendez pas à plein de raccourcis claviers pré configurés, vous allez devoir faire les votres.\n\nOu alors vous pouvez aussi utiliser des configurations préexistantes. On se croirait dans Doom Emacs!\n\nHyprland n'est pas un environnement de bureau complet. Il vous faudra un tableau de bord, un lanceur d'applications et d'autres outils. Quelques options populaires :\n* Barre d'état : Ashell (prêt à l'emploi) ou Waybar (très personnalisable). A noter qu'il y a maintenant des mini lib pour se faire ses barres facilement comme quickshell, astal.\n* Lanceur d'applications : Wofi (simple, clavier + souris)\n* Ou le fait d'utiliser un tiling peut même vous donner envie de changer de terminal? Foot, Kitty, Alacritty, etc.\n\nMais Awesome Hyprland vous listera bien plus de choses.\n\nJe n'ai pas encore testé ibus, et je sais que je vais rencontrer des soucis avec cela, comme j'en aurai sous Sway… (Pas trop envie de passer sous fcitx mais on verra)\n\nAspects techniques, conclusion\n\nAu cours du développement de Sway, Drew Devault a conçu une librairie , wlroots, qui est devenue indépendante de Sway et utilisée par d'autres compositeurs wayland.\n\nHyprland a démarré en 2022. En 2024, la dépendance à wlroots, qui été inclus sous forme de \"submodule git\" , a été abandonnée au profit de Aquamarine, un moteur de rendu en C++. L'abandon de wlroots, d'après l'auteur, tient au fait que\n- wlroots est en C\n- wlroots manque de doc\n- faire évoluer wlroots prend du temps\n- et accessoirement parce qu'il a été banni! ( Bon là désolé je préfère passer du temps sur la revue de Hyprland que sur les feux de l'amour, voyez ici.\n\nMais Aquamarine n'est pas un compétiteur de wlroots.\n\nConclusion\n\nHyprland, comme d'autres, ça prend un max de temps à s'approprier. Il faut lire et configurer à tout va, même si après coup on se rend compte que c'était simple. Ce qui l'est moins, c'est de choisir sa manière de travailler.\n\nJ'adore jouer avec les gestionnaires de fenêtre en mosaïque et Hyprland est une belle découverte . J'avais peur d'un simple ensemble d'animations flashy, mais il offre bien plus que cela. J'aimerais voir un tableau de bord style \"Activités\" de GNOME pour visualiser toutes les fenêtres et espaces de travail en un coup d'œil.

Il y a aussi pas mal de choses qui marchent mieux, par exemple je trouve que c'est plus stable avec les écrans externes et Hyprland a des options qui vont plus loin que bspwm et il est plus beau.\n\nDe temps en temps il y a des petites régressions, comme le primary selection qui ne passe plus depuis chromium (le copier/coller oui) depuis quelques jours.\n\nIl faut définir pas mal de variables d'env pour que toutes les applis s'y retrouvent.\n\nIl reste des petits truc, par exemple gromit-mpx pour dessiner sur l'écran qui n'est pas très stable.\n\nJe l'utilise sur Debian et je compile la dernière version depuis les sources. Il y a ça:\nhttps://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland\nMais je me suis fait mon script qui est plus simple.\n\nBon par contre, c'est comme pour bspwm, avec ces WM minimaux, il faut passer du temps sur chaque point pour trouver la bonne appli (suspend, screen lock, filtre lumière bleue, bar de status, …) et la configurer proprement (et quand on refait sa config on se dit, ah ben il y a quand même beaucoup de points jusqu'à ce que tout marche).\n\n# fonctionnalités sympas\n\nPosté par mornik le 27 mars 2025 à 11:50.

La fenetre viendra superposer tout l'écran, peut importe ou tu es.\n\nJe m'en sers quand j'ai besoins de garder sous la main une fenetre particulière, mais pas l'afficher en permanence. Par exemple un pdf de doc. Je l'affiche pour relire un passage et je le cache pour revenir à mon \"plan de travail\"\nhttps://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Uncommon-tips--tricks/#minimize-windows-using-special-workspaces\n\nJ'apprécie le côté fini et complet, dont le multi-écran. J'ai configuré des workspace spécifique à mon deuxième écran. Quand je suis à mon bureau, j'ai des applications qui vont directement dessus lorsque je connecte l'écran. Très pratique.\n\nJ'apprécie également que l'écran supplémentaire reste visible même quand je change de workspace sur l'cran principal. En gros le comportement opposé à Gnome. Je garde ainsi un oeil en permanence sur les applications de mon second écran, peut-importe mes activités (pratique pour garder une vue sur le chat ou sur la fameuse doc tech pendant qu'on rédige qqch)\n\nJe suis sous nixos, c'est vraiment top et bien intégré.\n\nSuivre le flux des commentaires\n\nNote : les commentaires appartiennent à celles et ceux qui les ont postés.

This one is a theme\nthat I choose. This one is a theme called Noir, which I concocted using the\ncalled Noir, which I concocted using the\ncalled Noir, which I concocted using the very simple mixture of pastel colors\nvery simple mixture of pastel colors\nvery simple mixture of pastel colors along with minimalist silhouettes like\nalong with minimalist silhouettes like\nalong with minimalist silhouettes like this wallpaper here. Not to mention,\nthis wallpaper here. Not to mention,\nthis wallpaper here. Not to mention, there's also a wallpaper switcher, which\nthere's also a wallpaper switcher, which\nthere's also a wallpaper switcher, which I teach you how to make for yourself\nI teach you how to make for yourself\nI teach you how to make for yourself instead of just copying and pasting.\ninstead of just copying and pasting.\ninstead of just copying and pasting. That way, if anything ends up breaking\nThat way, if anything ends up breaking\nThat way, if anything ends up breaking because of an update or because you\nbecause of an update or because you\nbecause of an update or because you wanted to try and add a new feature, you\nwanted to try and add a new feature, you\nwanted to try and add a new feature, you actually know how things are working and\nactually know how things are working and\nactually know how things are working and so you're able to figure it out on your\nso you're able to figure it out on your\nso you're able to figure it out on your own, instead of just going to Reddit and\nown, instead of just going to Reddit and\nown, instead of just going to Reddit and begging for help, hoping that somebody\nbegging for help, hoping that somebody\nbegging for help, hoping that somebody has 5 minutes to spare just helping you\nhas 5 minutes to spare just helping you\nhas 5 minutes to spare just helping you out with your problem. Right? Chances\nout with your problem. Right? Chances\nout with your problem. Right? Chances are, if you're watching [snorts] my\nare, if you're watching [snorts] my\nare, if you're watching [snorts] my channel and if you and I, we think on\nchannel and if you and I, we think on\nchannel and if you and I, we think on the same level, right? On the same\nthe same level, right? On the same\nthe same level, right? On the same wavelength, right? If our thoughts\nwavelength, right? If our thoughts\nwavelength, right? If our thoughts resonate and whatnot, all that magic\nresonate and whatnot, all that magic\nresonate and whatnot, all that magic stuff, you're most likely just going to\nstuff, you're most likely just going to\nstuff, you're most likely just going to want to learn how to do this stuff\nwant to learn how to do this stuff\nwant to learn how to do this stuff yourself instead of thinking, you know\nyourself instead of thinking, you know\nyourself instead of thinking, you know what, it's a really good idea if I just\nwhat, it's a really good idea if I just\nwhat, it's a really good idea if I just copy somebody else's dot files and\ncopy somebody else's dot files and\ncopy somebody else's dot files and monkey see monkey do, copy paste them.\nmonkey see monkey do, copy paste them.\nmonkey see monkey do, copy paste them. Chances are you're not thinking like\nChances are you're not thinking like\nChances are you're not thinking like that. Instead, you want to make\nthat. Instead, you want to make\nthat. Instead, you want to make something like this yourself, which is\nsomething like this yourself, which is\nsomething like this yourself, which is exactly what I show you how to do inside\nexactly what I show you how to do inside\nexactly what I show you how to do inside of Hyper Accelerator. So if we just go\nof Hyper Accelerator. So if we just go\nof Hyper Accelerator. So if we just go to the system reforging section here\nto the system reforging section here\nto the system reforging section here inside of the theme switches module\ninside of the theme switches module\ninside of the theme switches module which is a module that is 2 hours long\nwhich is a module that is 2 hours long\nwhich is a module that is 2 hours long right. Okay, so in this two-hour long\nright. Okay, so in this two-hour long\nright. Okay, so in this two-hour long module, there you go. I cover exactly\nmodule, there you go. I cover exactly\nmodule, there you go. I cover exactly what theme switches are, the different\nwhat theme switches are, the different\nwhat theme switches are, the different kinds, how to set up wallpaper based\nkinds, how to set up wallpaper based\nkinds, how to set up wallpaper based theme switching where basically you have\ntheme switching where basically you have\ntheme switching where basically you have a couple of tools, Pywall and Mattyen,\na couple of tools, Pywall and Mattyen,\na couple of tools, Pywall and Mattyen, that allow you to extract the colors\nthat allow you to extract the colors\nthat allow you to extract the colors from your wallpaper and allow you to use\nfrom your wallpaper and allow you to use\nfrom your wallpaper and allow you to use them to theme the various parts of your\nthem to theme the various parts of your\nthem to theme the various parts of your system from your status bar to your\nsystem from your status bar to your\nsystem from your status bar to your notification demon with this beautiful\nnotification demon with this beautiful\nnotification demon with this beautiful animation here along with your logout\nanimation here along with your logout\nanimation here along with your logout menu, your lock screen, and a whole\nmenu, your lock screen, and a whole\nmenu, your lock screen, and a whole bunch of other stuff. And that along\nbunch of other stuff. And that along\nbunch of other stuff. And that along with of course in finishing touches we\nwith of course in finishing touches we\nwith of course in finishing touches we have the modularity concept which I\nhave the modularity concept which I\nhave the modularity concept which I explained earlier. So here I cover why\nexplained earlier. So here I cover why\nexplained earlier. So here I cover why make things modular the apps we can make\nmake things modular the apps we can make\nmake things modular the apps we can make modular and how to actually go about\nmodular and how to actually go about\nmodular and how to actually go about doing that like practical step-by-step\ndoing that like practical step-by-step\ndoing that like practical step-by-step systems and basically me showing my\nsystems and basically me showing my\nsystems and basically me showing my screen showing you exactly how you can\nscreen showing you exactly how you can\nscreen showing you exactly how you can do it for every single file and folder\ndo it for every single file and folder\ndo it for every single file and folder on your machine. So, if you want to\non your machine. So, if you want to\non your machine. So, if you want to learn how to make something like this\nlearn how to make something like this\nlearn how to make something like this yourself instead of just observing and\nyourself instead of just observing and\nyourself instead of just observing and then not actually getting anywhere, you\nthen not actually getting anywhere, you\nthen not actually getting anywhere, you can go ahead click the first link in the\ncan go ahead click the first link in the\ncan go ahead click the first link in the description and I'd love to help you\ndescription and I'd love to help you\ndescription and I'd love to help you out. Now, let's go into my keybinds\nout. Now, let's go into my keybinds\nout. Now, let's go into my keybinds file. And here, if we scroll all the way\nfile. And here, if we scroll all the way\nfile. And here, if we scroll all the way down, you should see scrolling layout.\ndown, you should see scrolling layout.\ndown, you should see scrolling layout. Now, here there are a couple of simple\nNow, here there are a couple of simple\nNow, here there are a couple of simple binds that I've set up. Okay, not too\nbinds that I've set up. Okay, not too\nbinds that I've set up. Okay, not too many. So, let me just show you them\nmany. So, let me just show you them\nmany. So, let me just show you them right now. Most of these are going to\nright now. Most of these are going to\nright now. Most of these are going to require more than one window. So, that's\nrequire more than one window. So, that's\nrequire more than one window. So, that's what I've got here. Okay. Now, the first\nwhat I've got here. Okay. Now, the first\nwhat I've got here. Okay. Now, the first couple of keybinds are just super period\ncouple of keybinds are just super period\ncouple of keybinds are just super period and comma, which allow me to move\nand comma, which allow me to move\nand comma, which allow me to move between different columns. So, a column\nbetween different columns. So, a column\nbetween different columns. So, a column is basically a column, right? But\nis basically a column, right? But\nis basically a column, right? But strictly speaking, inside of scrolling\nstrictly speaking, inside of scrolling\nstrictly speaking, inside of scrolling layout terms, a column can kind of be\nlayout terms, a column can kind of be\nlayout terms, a column can kind of be thought of as a place where you can just\nthought of as a place where you can just\nthought of as a place where you can just place windows. Let's say, for example,\nplace windows. Let's say, for example,\nplace windows. Let's say, for example, that I had another window with like like\nthat I had another window with like like\nthat I had another window with like like this basically. Okay, let's say I call\nthis basically. Okay, let's say I call\nthis basically. Okay, let's say I call this window one and then I call this\nthis window one and then I call this\nthis window one and then I call this window two. Okay, because window one and\nwindow two. Okay, because window one and\nwindow two. Okay, because window one and window two are right below each other.\nwindow two are right below each other.\nwindow two are right below each other. Okay, you can consider them to be in the\nOkay, you can consider them to be in the\nOkay, you can consider them to be in the same column. So windows that are\nsame column. So windows that are\nsame column. So windows that are practically right below each other can\npractically right below each other can\npractically right below each other can be considered to be inside of the same\nbe considered to be inside of the same\nbe considered to be inside of the same column. That that's what's going on. So\ncolumn. That that's what's going on. So\ncolumn. That that's what's going on. So with super period and comma, you're able\nwith super period and comma, you're able\nwith super period and comma, you're able to switch between the different columns\nto switch between the different columns\nto switch between the different columns as you can see. Then after that we have\nas you can see. Then after that we have\nas you can see. Then after that we have super shift period and whatever other\nsuper shift period and whatever other\nsuper shift period and whatever other key buttons that we have here which\nkey buttons that we have here which\nkey buttons that we have here which basically allow us to move between the\nbasically allow us to move between the\nbasically allow us to move between the different columns. Now if I chose to\ndifferent columns. Now if I chose to\ndifferent columns. Now if I chose to open another window let's say I wanted\nopen another window let's say I wanted\nopen another window let's say I wanted to move this window over here down to\nto move this window over here down to\nto move this window over here down to the bottom of the second column. I just\nthe bottom of the second column. I just\nthe bottom of the second column. I just have to press super shift period or that\nhave to press super shift period or that\nhave to press super shift period or that was actually comma and that is going to\nwas actually comma and that is going to\nwas actually comma and that is going to move the window to the second column. I\nmove the window to the second column. I\nmove the window to the second column. I can do the same again which is going to\ncan do the same again which is going to\ncan do the same again which is going to move it to the top and I can also do\nmove it to the top and I can also do\nmove it to the top and I can also do this with up and down keys. That way I\nthis with up and down keys. That way I\nthis with up and down keys. That way I can switch the order of the windows in\ncan switch the order of the windows in\ncan switch the order of the windows in any particular column that I wanted to.\nany particular column that I wanted to.\nany particular column that I wanted to. That is what you can do with super shift\nThat is what you can do with super shift\nThat is what you can do with super shift and whatever other binds that I've put\nand whatever other binds that I've put\nand whatever other binds that I've put here. Great. Then after that we have\nhere. Great. Then after that we have\nhere. Great. Then after that we have super equal which allows me to control\nsuper equal which allows me to control\nsuper equal which allows me to control the size of each column. Now let's say I\nthe size of each column. Now let's say I\nthe size of each column. Now let's say I wanted to make window one a little bit\nwanted to make window one a little bit\nwanted to make window one a little bit smaller. I can do that to the point\nsmaller. I can do that to the point\nsmaller. I can do that to the point where this is the kind of layout that\nwhere this is the kind of layout that\nwhere this is the kind of layout that you see which is not quite easily\nyou see which is not quite easily\nyou see which is not quite easily achievable in something like master\nachievable in something like master\nachievable in something like master layout. Hell, it's not even possible\nlayout. Hell, it's not even possible\nlayout. Hell, it's not even possible there, right? With these gaps and\nthere, right? With these gaps and\nthere, right? With these gaps and whatnot, only on one side with dwindle\nwhatnot, only on one side with dwindle\nwhatnot, only on one side with dwindle with with dwindle layout, right? You\nwith with dwindle layout, right? You\nwith with dwindle layout, right? You might actually be able to pull it off,\nmight actually be able to pull it off,\nmight actually be able to pull it off, but chances are it's not going to look\nbut chances are it's not going to look\nbut chances are it's not going to look quite as good as this. What I mean is\nquite as good as this. What I mean is\nquite as good as this. What I mean is you're not going to be able to get it to\nyou're not going to be able to get it to\nyou're not going to be able to get it to look this way without quite some\nlook this way without quite some\nlook this way without quite some haggling with it. So, what super equal\nhaggling with it. So, what super equal\nhaggling with it. So, what super equal and minus does is just allows you to\nand minus does is just allows you to\nand minus does is just allows you to change the size of each column. That's\nchange the size of each column. That's\nchange the size of each column. That's it. and super C and X super X that I\nit. and super C and X super X that I\nit. and super C and X super X that I have bound to change between different\nhave bound to change between different\nhave bound to change between different preset column sizes. So if you see here\npreset column sizes. So if you see here\npreset column sizes. So if you see here plus conf and minus conf, you can\nplus conf and minus conf, you can\nplus conf and minus conf, you can configure this conf elsewhere. And what\nconfigure this conf elsewhere. And what\nconfigure this conf elsewhere. And what that allows you to do is basically\nthat allows you to do is basically\nthat allows you to do is basically switch between the different predestined\nswitch between the different predestined\nswitch between the different predestined and pre-ordained column sizes. So this\nand pre-ordained column sizes. So this\nand pre-ordained column sizes. So this one is kind of like a maximized one as\none is kind of like a maximized one as\none is kind of like a maximized one as you can see here. And yeah, that is for\nyou can see here. And yeah, that is for\nyou can see here. And yeah, that is for these binds. Then after that we have\nthese binds. Then after that we have\nthese binds. Then after that we have column management itself. Let's say I\ncolumn management itself. Let's say I\ncolumn management itself. Let's say I had another column here. Okay, we'll\nhad another column here. Okay, we'll\nhad another column here. Okay, we'll actually just put this to Yeah, there\nactually just put this to Yeah, there\nactually just put this to Yeah, there you go. Perfect. Now, let's say I wanted\nyou go. Perfect. Now, let's say I wanted\nyou go. Perfect. Now, let's say I wanted window two to be on its own column. I\nwindow two to be on its own column. I\nwindow two to be on its own column. I just have to press super P and that's\njust have to press super P and that's\njust have to press super P and that's going to promote the window to its own\ngoing to promote the window to its own\ngoing to promote the window to its own column. Then after that, there's also\ncolumn. Then after that, there's also\ncolumn. Then after that, there's also toggle fit. You might have noticed that\ntoggle fit. You might have noticed that\ntoggle fit. You might have noticed that as I'm navigating [clears throat] around\nas I'm navigating [clears throat] around\nas I'm navigating [clears throat] around these windows, the window suddenly pops\nthese windows, the window suddenly pops\nthese windows, the window suddenly pops up to the center. If I wanted to disable\nup to the center. If I wanted to disable\nup to the center. If I wanted to disable that behavior, I just press super F. And\nthat behavior, I just press super F. And\nthat behavior, I just press super F. And then that would just basically give me\nthen that would just basically give me\nthen that would just basically give me the same behavior as using alt, which is\nthe same behavior as using alt, which is\nthe same behavior as using alt, which is my main mod key, and my arrow keys in\nmy main mod key, and my arrow keys in\nmy main mod key, and my arrow keys in order to move around between different\norder to move around between different\norder to move around between different windows. Then there's also swapping the\nwindows. Then there's also swapping the\nwindows. Then there's also swapping the different columns. Let's say this is\ndifferent columns. Let's say this is\ndifferent columns. Let's say this is window one. Okay, window one. If I\nwindow one. Okay, window one. If I\nwindow one. Okay, window one. If I wanted to swap, let's say this one,\nwanted to swap, let's say this one,\nwanted to swap, let's say this one, super S, that would move window one all\nsuper S, that would move window one all\nsuper S, that would move window one all the way to the right. Super A would move\nthe way to the right. Super A would move\nthe way to the right. Super A would move the window all the way to the left.\nthe window all the way to the left.\nthe window all the way to the left. That's it. and then super 1 2 3 which is\nThat's it. and then super 1 2 3 which is\nThat's it. and then super 1 2 3 which is to basically take an entire column and\nto basically take an entire column and\nto basically take an entire column and move it to a completely different\nmove it to a completely different\nmove it to a completely different workspace. So if I wanted to move this\nworkspace. So if I wanted to move this\nworkspace. So if I wanted to move this one this second column here I just press\none this second column here I just press\none this second column here I just press super one and that would send the\nsuper one and that would send the\nsuper one and that would send the entirety of the column all the way to\nentirety of the column all the way to\nentirety of the column all the way to the first workspace. Now if you just\nthe first workspace. Now if you just\nthe first workspace. Now if you just noticed there was a little bit of\nnoticed there was a little bit of\nnoticed there was a little bit of artifacting here which means that this\nartifacting here which means that this\nartifacting here which means that this plug-in is not perfectly configured and\nplug-in is not perfectly configured and\nplug-in is not perfectly configured and there are still a lot of bugs to be\nthere are still a lot of bugs to be\nthere are still a lot of bugs to be squashed and more ironing of the fabric\nsquashed and more ironing of the fabric\nsquashed and more ironing of the fabric to be done here. But that's not to say\nto be done here. But that's not to say\nto be done here. But that's not to say that this doesn't work at all. In fact,\nthat this doesn't work at all. In fact,\nthat this doesn't work at all. In fact, if you really like N scrolling out, but\nif you really like N scrolling out, but\nif you really like N scrolling out, but then you miss the animations, or not\nthen you miss the animations, or not\nthen you miss the animations, or not necessarily the animations, but the blur\nnecessarily the animations, but the blur\nnecessarily the animations, but the blur that Hyperland so does really well, you\nthat Hyperland so does really well, you\nthat Hyperland so does really well, you can still get the same layout effect,\ncan still get the same layout effect,\ncan still get the same layout effect, right? Maybe not to the same extent that\nright? Maybe not to the same extent that\nright? Maybe not to the same extent that Ner does it, but regardless, you still\nNer does it, but regardless, you still\nNer does it, but regardless, you still have something that you can use in the\nhave something that you can use in the\nhave something that you can use in the meantime, right? As the plug-in keeps\nmeantime, right? As the plug-in keeps\nmeantime, right? As the plug-in keeps getting better and better. So, that's\ngetting better and better. So, that's\ngetting better and better. So, that's the first thing that I learned. You can\nthe first thing that I learned. You can\nthe first thing that I learned. You can supercharge the experience with\nsupercharge the experience with\nsupercharge the experience with scrolling specific keybinds, which you\nscrolling specific keybinds, which you\nscrolling specific keybinds, which you can just copy and paste, by the way, as\ncan just copy and paste, by the way, as\ncan just copy and paste, by the way, as I showed you earlier by just taking a\nI showed you earlier by just taking a\nI showed you earlier by just taking a screenshot and then asking your favorite\nscreenshot and then asking your favorite\nscreenshot and then asking your favorite AI to just give you the code. Pro tip\nAI to just give you the code. Pro tip\nAI to just give you the code. Pro tip for you there. Okay, then after that\nfor you there. Okay, then after that\nfor you there. Okay, then after that second one, what's with all the question\nsecond one, what's with all the question\nsecond one, what's with all the question marks? What's with all the question\nmarks? What's with all the question\nmarks? What's with all the question marks? Well, I'm going to show you.\nmarks? Well, I'm going to show you.\nmarks? Well, I'm going to show you. Second one is an issue I came up with\nSecond one is an issue I came up with\nSecond one is an issue I came up with using hyperscrolling. Now, it's not just\nusing hyperscrolling. Now, it's not just\nusing hyperscrolling. Now, it's not just hyperscrolling. I also later figured it\nhyperscrolling. I also later figured it\nhyperscrolling. I also later figured it out to be a bunch of the other Hyperland\nout to be a bunch of the other Hyperland\nout to be a bunch of the other Hyperland plugins as well. But basically what\nplugins as well. But basically what\nplugins as well. But basically what happens is every single time I log into\nhappens is every single time I log into\nhappens is every single time I log into Hyperland, it gives me an unknown layout\nHyperland, it gives me an unknown layout\nHyperland, it gives me an unknown layout warning at the bottom left. Okay. So\nwarning at the bottom left. Okay. So\nwarning at the bottom left. Okay. So contrary to what most of you might\ncontrary to what most of you might\ncontrary to what most of you might think, I haven't actually customized my\nthink, I haven't actually customized my\nthink, I haven't actually customized my what do you call it? What was it called?\nwhat do you call it? What was it called?\nwhat do you call it? What was it called? Ah, god damn it. What was it? Yes,\nAh, god damn it. What was it? Yes,\nAh, god damn it. What was it? Yes, display manager. Yep. So on my older\ndisplay manager. Yep. So on my older\ndisplay manager. Yep. So on my older machine, I was using a display manager,\nmachine, I was using a display manager,\nmachine, I was using a display manager, but then using your TTY to login, right?\nbut then using your TTY to login, right?\nbut then using your TTY to login, right? Using your TTY to login is just so much\nUsing your TTY to login is just so much\nUsing your TTY to login is just so much easier and simpler. So that's what I was\neasier and simpler. So that's what I was\neasier and simpler. So that's what I was going with. And the TTY it briefly gives\ngoing with. And the TTY it briefly gives\ngoing with. And the TTY it briefly gives you the output of whatever command you\nyou the output of whatever command you\nyou the output of whatever command you initialize it with. Like let's say\ninitialize it with. Like let's say\ninitialize it with. Like let's say hyperland for example. If I launched\nhyperland for example. If I launched\nhyperland for example. If I launched hyperland like so it would launch\nhyperland like so it would launch\nhyperland like so it would launch another hyperland window. Right now you\nanother hyperland window. Right now you\nanother hyperland window. Right now you can see all of these. Yep. This is what\ncan see all of these. Yep. This is what\ncan see all of these. Yep. This is what I was talking about. So I got this\nI was talking about. So I got this\nI was talking about. So I got this unknown layout error for whatever\nunknown layout error for whatever\nunknown layout error for whatever reason. Okay. And\nreason. Okay. And\nreason. Okay. And in order to fix this oh boy in order to\nin order to fix this oh boy in order to\nin order to fix this oh boy in order to fix this I had to go on quite a bit of\nfix this I had to go on quite a bit of\nfix this I had to go on quite a bit of an expedition, right? in order to figure\nan expedition, right? in order to figure\nan expedition, right? in order to figure out what the hell was actually going on.\nout what the hell was actually going on.\nout what the hell was actually going on. Now, turns out this is a little bit of\nNow, turns out this is a little bit of\nNow, turns out this is a little bit of something related to the plugins not\nsomething related to the plugins not\nsomething related to the plugins not being initialized properly, which can\nbeing initialized properly, which can\nbeing initialized properly, which can easily be fixed with this. If I go to my\neasily be fixed with this. If I go to my\neasily be fixed with this. If I go to my auto start config autostart.com here,\nauto start config autostart.com here,\nauto start config autostart.com here, you should see that I have added an exec\nyou should see that I have added an exec\nyou should see that I have added an exec once called hyperpm reload. Now, what\nonce called hyperpm reload. Now, what\nonce called hyperpm reload. Now, what does hyperpm reload do? It's best if you\ndoes hyperpm reload do? It's best if you\ndoes hyperpm reload do? It's best if you just take a look for yourself. hyperp\njust take a look for yourself. hyperp\njust take a look for yourself. hyperp reload and the plug-in load state has\nreload and the plug-in load state has\nreload and the plug-in load state has basically been ensured right after that\nbasically been ensured right after that\nbasically been ensured right after that they've loaded hyperbars and then made\nthey've loaded hyperbars and then made\nthey've loaded hyperbars and then made sure that again plug-in load state is\nsure that again plug-in load state is\nsure that again plug-in load state is ensured and every single plugin that I\nensured and every single plugin that I\nensured and every single plugin that I have enabled is actually working now\nhave enabled is actually working now\nhave enabled is actually working now this also consequentially right enables\nthis also consequentially right enables\nthis also consequentially right enables every single plugin that I have enabled\nevery single plugin that I have enabled\nevery single plugin that I have enabled what I mean to say by that is actually\nwhat I mean to say by that is actually\nwhat I mean to say by that is actually just turning the plugin on right\njust turning the plugin on right\njust turning the plugin on right initializing it or let me show you this\ninitializing it or let me show you this\ninitializing it or let me show you this way it's hyperp list right now I have\nway it's hyperp list right now I have\nway it's hyperp list right now I have three of the plugins enabled here right\nthree of the plugins enabled here right\nthree of the plugins enabled here right enabled equals true but then that\nenabled equals true but then that\nenabled equals true but then that doesn't always mean that the plugin is\ndoesn't always mean that the plugin is\ndoesn't always mean that the plugin is constantly showing like with hyperbars I\nconstantly showing like with hyperbars I\nconstantly showing like with hyperbars I can choose to load or unload the plugin\ncan choose to load or unload the plugin\ncan choose to load or unload the plugin by pressing a keybind that's different\nby pressing a keybind that's different\nby pressing a keybind that's different okay but using hyper PM reload is just\nokay but using hyper PM reload is just\nokay but using hyper PM reload is just going to reload all of the plugins\ngoing to reload all of the plugins\ngoing to reload all of the plugins causing them to be what do you call it\ncausing them to be what do you call it\ncausing them to be what do you call it turned on at the same time right so the\nturned on at the same time right so the\nturned on at the same time right so the best way that I've figured out to fix\nbest way that I've figured out to fix\nbest way that I've figured out to fix this little unknown layout out issue\nthis little unknown layout out issue\nthis little unknown layout out issue that you saw earlier is to just make\nthat you saw earlier is to just make\nthat you saw earlier is to just make sure that hyperpm reload is executed\nsure that hyperpm reload is executed\nsure that hyperpm reload is executed every single time I log into hyperlan.\nevery single time I log into hyperlan.\nevery single time I log into hyperlan. That way I get this annoying little\nThat way I get this annoying little\nThat way I get this annoying little notification at the top right. But that\nnotification at the top right.

It's a simple fact that I\nis this. It's a simple fact that I\nis this. It's a simple fact that I picked up right now in my four years of\npicked up right now in my four years of\npicked up right now in my four years of Rising Hyperland. Okay. And basically in\nRising Hyperland. Okay. And basically in\nRising Hyperland. Okay. And basically in my Linux rising journey when I first got\nmy Linux rising journey when I first got\nmy Linux rising journey when I first got started in 2021 I started with BSPWM or\nstarted in 2021 I started with BSPWM or\nstarted in 2021 I started with BSPWM or actually it was i3 that was my first\nactually it was i3 that was my first\nactually it was i3 that was my first tiling window manager. So i3 I don't\ntiling window manager. So i3 I don't\ntiling window manager. So i3 I don't even know what layout i3 has. Let me\neven know what layout i3 has. Let me\neven know what layout i3 has. Let me just look i3 layout. What layout is it?\njust look i3 layout. What layout is it?\njust look i3 layout. What layout is it? Let's check here.\nLet's check here.\nLet's check here. It is a hierarchical tree structure.\nIt is a hierarchical tree structure.\nIt is a hierarchical tree structure. Okay, great. So the I started with I3's\nOkay, great. So the I started with I3's\nOkay, great. So the I started with I3's hierarchical tree structure. God, it\nhierarchical tree structure. God, it\nhierarchical tree structure. God, it sounds so funny even me saying it. then\nsounds so funny even me saying it. then\nsounds so funny even me saying it. then went on to BSPWM's dwindle I mean what\nwent on to BSPWM's dwindle I mean what\nwent on to BSPWM's dwindle I mean what was it called again ah yes binary space\nwas it called again ah yes binary space\nwas it called again ah yes binary space partitioning layout and then after that\npartitioning layout and then after that\npartitioning layout and then after that switched to gnome for a little bit so on\nswitched to gnome for a little bit so on\nswitched to gnome for a little bit so on and so forth so I've used a fair bit of\nand so forth so I've used a fair bit of\nand so forth so I've used a fair bit of layouts and this is something that I\nlayouts and this is something that I\nlayouts and this is something that I learned right and I especially got\nlearned right and I especially got\nlearned right and I especially got reminded of this as soon as I picked up\nreminded of this as soon as I picked up\nreminded of this as soon as I picked up hyper scrolling and it's the fact that\nhyper scrolling and it's the fact that\nhyper scrolling and it's the fact that you get used to whatever layout that you\nyou get used to whatever layout that you\nyou get used to whatever layout that you pick so it doesn't matter if I chose the\npick so it doesn't matter if I chose the\npick so it doesn't matter if I chose the master and slave layout or whether I\nmaster and slave layout or whether I\nmaster and slave layout or whether I chose the dwindle layout or whether I\nchose the dwindle layout or whether I\nchose the dwindle layout or whether I chose scrolling layout or basically any\nchose scrolling layout or basically any\nchose scrolling layout or basically any other layout. Hell, even if I switched\nother layout. Hell, even if I switched\nother layout. Hell, even if I switched to a floating window manager, I'm pretty\nto a floating window manager, I'm pretty\nto a floating window manager, I'm pretty sure that I would figure out a way not\nsure that I would figure out a way not\nsure that I would figure out a way not only to tile the windows cuz that's\nonly to tile the windows cuz that's\nonly to tile the windows cuz that's already been done a million different\nalready been done a million different\nalready been done a million different times, but even if I weren't to tile the\ntimes, but even if I weren't to tile the\ntimes, but even if I weren't to tile the windows, right, I would figure out a way\nwindows, right, I would figure out a way\nwindows, right, I would figure out a way in order to still make that floating\nin order to still make that floating\nin order to still make that floating window manager work as best as possible.\nwindow manager work as best as possible.\nwindow manager work as best as possible. That's just the truth. That's just the\nThat's just the truth. That's just the\nThat's just the truth. That's just the reality of the world, right? You get\nreality of the world, right?

It's going to be hyper scrolling over\nIt's going to be hyper scrolling over\nIt's going to be hyper scrolling over here. Great. Now let's do that. So\nhere. Great. Now let's do that. So\nhere. Great. Now let's do that. So hyperp update in order to update the\nhyperp update in order to update the\nhyperp update in order to update the package manager. Oh, seems like some\npackage manager. Oh, seems like some\npackage manager. Oh, seems like some errors have happened. Now how do we fix\nerrors have happened. Now how do we fix\nerrors have happened. Now how do we fix these? We need to make sure that these\nthese? We need to make sure that these\nthese? We need to make sure that these dependencies are installed so that typ\ndependencies are installed so that typ\ndependencies are installed so that typ works. So we just have to type in I\nworks. So we just have to type in I\nworks. So we just have to type in I which is shorthand or an alias for yay-\nwhich is shorthand or an alias for yay-\nwhich is shorthand or an alias for yay- s. So yay - cmake mason cpio pkg config\ns. So yay - cmake mason cpio pkg config\ns. So yay - cmake mason cpio pkg config git g++ and gcc.\ngit g++ and gcc.\ngit g++ and gcc. Now it should install all of these once\nNow it should install all of these once\nNow it should install all of these once all of these dependencies are installed.\nall of these dependencies are installed.\nall of these dependencies are installed. Actually, let me add in the d- needed\nActually, let me add in the d- needed\nActually, let me add in the d- needed flag in Arch Linux, which basically\nflag in Arch Linux, which basically\nflag in Arch Linux, which basically installs only the packages which are not\ninstalls only the packages which are not\ninstalls only the packages which are not already installed. So, once we install\nalready installed. So, once we install\nalready installed. So, once we install this, we're should or we should be able\nthis, we're should or we should be able\nthis, we're should or we should be able to get HyperPM working properly.\nto get HyperPM working properly.\nto get HyperPM working properly. Okay. Now, if we type hyperpm update,\nOkay. Now, if we type hyperpm update,\nOkay. Now, if we type hyperpm update, as you can see, it's updating all of\nas you can see, it's updating all of\nas you can see, it's updating all of these repos.\nthese repos.\nthese repos. Now, after that, we're going to have to\nNow, after that, we're going to have to\nNow, after that, we're going to have to add in this specific repository. There\nadd in this specific repository. There\nadd in this specific repository. There are multiple different repositories we\nare multiple different repositories we\nare multiple different repositories we can actually add to get different\ncan actually add to get different\ncan actually add to get different Hyperline plugins, but these are the\nHyperline plugins, but these are the\nHyperline plugins, but these are the official ones. Now, they give out a\nofficial ones. Now, they give out a\nofficial ones. Now, they give out a warning in the wiki stating that any\nwarning in the wiki stating that any\nwarning in the wiki stating that any plugins apart from the official ones are\nplugins apart from the official ones are\nplugins apart from the official ones are not going to have official support along\nnot going to have official support along\nnot going to have official support along with guaranteed safety, right? Because\nwith guaranteed safety, right? Because\nwith guaranteed safety, right? Because these are official, you can pretty much\nthese are official, you can pretty much\nthese are official, you can pretty much tell that they're safe. But for other\ntell that they're safe. But for other\ntell that they're safe. But for other plugins, you can't quite say the same.\nplugins, you can't quite say the same.\nplugins, you can't quite say the same. Right now, that's for adding the\nRight now, that's for adding the\nRight now, that's for adding the repository and then enabling it. It is\nrepository and then enabling it. It is\nrepository and then enabling it. It is pretty simple. So let's just wait for\npretty simple. So let's just wait for\npretty simple. So let's just wait for this to finish.\nthis to finish.\nthis to finish. Okay, it is finally done. Now we just\nOkay, it is finally done. Now we just\nOkay, it is finally done. Now we just have to add in this repository which\nhave to add in this repository which\nhave to add in this repository which should already be added. However, let's\nshould already be added. However, let's\nshould already be added. However, let's just type that in again. Yep, says\njust type that in again. Yep, says\njust type that in again. Yep, says repository already installed. So all we\nrepository already installed. So all we\nrepository already installed. So all we have to do is just hyperp enable\nhave to do is just hyperp enable\nhave to do is just hyperp enable hyperscrolling.\nhyperscrolling.\nhyperscrolling. Now I've already enabled it before, so\nNow I've already enabled it before, so\nNow I've already enabled it before, so it's most likely going to fail over\nit's most likely going to fail over\nit's most likely going to fail over here, but you most likely haven't\nhere, but you most likely haven't\nhere, but you most likely haven't enabled it. Okay, got it. So, just make\nenabled it. Okay, got it. So, just make\nenabled it. Okay, got it. So, just make sure to enable and once that's done, you\nsure to enable and once that's done, you\nsure to enable and once that's done, you should be able to read the readme in\nshould be able to read the readme in\nshould be able to read the readme in hyper scrolling's folder. So, you click\nhyper scrolling's folder. So, you click\nhyper scrolling's folder. So, you click on the folder and you see the readme\non the folder and you see the readme\non the folder and you see the readme over here. Okay. Now, this adds a\nover here. Okay. Now, this adds a\nover here. Okay. Now, this adds a scrolling layout to hyperline which is\nscrolling layout to hyperline which is\nscrolling layout to hyperline which is basically what Ni uses. Now, if we open\nbasically what Ni uses. Now, if we open\nbasically what Ni uses. Now, if we open the config, so config\nthe config, so config\nthe config, so config hyper modules, what's that called?\nhyper modules, what's that called?\nhyper modules, what's that called? Plugins.com.\nPlugins.com.\nPlugins.com. Oh, and by the way, if you're wondering\nOh, and by the way, if you're wondering\nOh, and by the way, if you're wondering what this modules folder is about, I\nwhat this modules folder is about, I\nwhat this modules folder is about, I cover it in more detail in a section\ncover it in more detail in a section\ncover it in more detail in a section called modularity in the first link in\ncalled modularity in the first link in\ncalled modularity in the first link in the description. So, if you want to know\nthe description. So, if you want to know\nthe description. So, if you want to know what it is, you can just go ahead and\nwhat it is, you can just go ahead and\nwhat it is, you can just go ahead and check that out. Anyway, let's click over\ncheck that out.

So, the plug-in is already enabled,\nSo, the plug-in is already enabled,\nSo, the plug-in is already enabled, right? So, full screen on one column is\nright? So, full screen on one column is\nright? So, full screen on one column is set to true, which basically means if\nset to true, which basically means if\nset to true, which basically means if there's only one window, what's going to\nthere's only one window, what's going to\nthere's only one window, what's going to happen is that that window will be tiled\nhappen is that that window will be tiled\nhappen is that that window will be tiled just as you see over here. Now, the\njust as you see over here. Now, the\njust as you see over here. Now, the layout isn't actually set properly,\nlayout isn't actually set properly,\nlayout isn't actually set properly, which means that you're not going to see\nwhich means that you're not going to see\nwhich means that you're not going to see any changes. But in order to make sure\nany changes. But in order to make sure\nany changes. But in order to make sure that the layout is actually seen, all we\nthat the layout is actually seen, all we\nthat the layout is actually seen, all we have to do is just set general layout to\nhave to do is just set general layout to\nhave to do is just set general layout to scrolling in order to use the layout.\nscrolling in order to use the layout.\nscrolling in order to use the layout. So, let's open config hypermodules\nSo, let's open config hypermodules\nSo, let's open config hypermodules layout here. Okay, never mind. It's\nlayout here. Okay, never mind. It's\nlayout here. Okay, never mind. It's probably in decorations. So, decorations\nprobably in decorations. So, decorations\nprobably in decorations. So, decorations dot Okay, decoration.com.\ndot Okay, decoration.com.\ndot Okay, decoration.com. Here you see the layout, right? So under\nHere you see the layout, right? So under\nHere you see the layout, right? So under the general key we have master. Okay. So\nthe general key we have master. Okay. So\nthe general key we have master. Okay. So what we have to do is replace master for\nwhat we have to do is replace master for\nwhat we have to do is replace master for scrolling.\nscrolling.\nscrolling. And once we do that as you can see over\nAnd once we do that as you can see over\nAnd once we do that as you can see over here we have entered the scrolling\nhere we have entered the scrolling\nhere we have entered the scrolling layout. And I can switch through all of\nlayout. And I can switch through all of\nlayout. And I can switch through all of my windows using the alt key which is\nmy windows using the alt key which is\nmy windows using the alt key which is actually my mod key. I've configured it\nactually my mod key. I've configured it\nactually my mod key. I've configured it to be the mod key along with my arrow\nto be the mod key along with my arrow\nto be the mod key along with my arrow keys. So I can add in how many other\nkeys. So I can add in how many other\nkeys. So I can add in how many other windows I want on just one particular\nwindows I want on just one particular\nwindows I want on just one particular workspace and it's pretty much going to\nworkspace and it's pretty much going to\nworkspace and it's pretty much going to behave the exact same as it does in Ni.\nbehave the exact same as it does in Ni.\nbehave the exact same as it does in Ni. Now let's say I wanted to resize the\nNow let's say I wanted to resize the\nNow let's say I wanted to resize the windows. I'd do something like this and\nwindows. I'd do something like this and\nwindows. I'd do something like this and then tada. If I had to flick between the\nthen tada. If I had to flick between the\nthen tada. If I had to flick between the two of the windows, all I have to do is\ntwo of the windows, all I have to do is\ntwo of the windows, all I have to do is just hover on the window on which\njust hover on the window on which\njust hover on the window on which basically I want my cursor to be and the\nbasically I want my cursor to be and the\nbasically I want my cursor to be and the window that I want to interact with and\nwindow that I want to interact with and\nwindow that I want to interact with and it's going to do that for me. There's of\nit's going to do that for me. There's of\nit's going to do that for me. There's of course a setting that you can change\ncourse a setting that you can change\ncourse a setting that you can change your follow focus. If you set that to\nyour follow focus. If you set that to\nyour follow focus. If you set that to false, right? What's going to happen is\nfalse, right? What's going to happen is\nfalse, right? What's going to happen is you're most likely going to have to\nyou're most likely going to have to\nyou're most likely going to have to click. Now it's either follow focus or\nclick. Now it's either follow focus or\nclick. Now it's either follow focus or another option over here, but most\nanother option over here, but most\nanother option over here, but most likely it's follow focus, right? Apart\nlikely it's follow focus, right? Apart\nlikely it's follow focus, right? Apart from that, we can use hyperct in order\nfrom that, we can use hyperct in order\nfrom that, we can use hyperct in order to control the rest of the layout\nto control the rest of the layout\nto control the rest of the layout messages.
