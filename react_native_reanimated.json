This section is packed with interactive examples, code snippets and explanations. Are you ready? Let's dive in!\n\nWhat is React Native Reanimated?�\n\nReact Native Reanimated is a powerful animation library built by Software Mansion.\n\nWith Reanimated, you can easily create smooth animations and interactions that run on the UI thread.\n\nPrerequisites�\n\nReanimated 4.x works only with the React Native New Architecture (Fabric). If your app still uses the old architecture, you can use Reanimated in version 3 which is still actively maintained.\n\nAlternatively, you can dive into our examples on GitHub.\n\nInstallation�\n\nIt takes two steps to add Reanimated 4 to an Expo project:\n\nStep 1: Install the package�\n\nInstall react-native-reanimated and react-native-worklets packages from npm:\n\nNPM\nYARN\nnpm install react-native-reanimated\n\nDependencies�\n\nThis library requires an installation of the react-native-worklets dependency. It was separated from react-native-reanimated for better modularity and must be installed separately. You can read more about Worklets in the Worklets documentation.\n\nNPM\nYARN\nnpm install react-native-worklets\n\nStep 2: Rebuild native dependencies�\n\nRun prebuild to update the native code in the ios and android directories.\n\nNPM\nYARN\nnpx expo prebuild\n\n\nAnd that's it! Reanimated 4 is now configured in your Expo project.\n\nReact Native Community CLI�\n\nWhen using React Native Community CLI, you also need to manually add the react-native-worklets/plugin plugin to your babel.config.js.\n\n  module.exports = {\n    presets: [\n      ... // don't add it here :)\n    ],\n    plugins: [\n      ...\n\n      'react-native-worklets/plugin',\n\n    ],\n  };\n\nCAUTION\n\nreact-native-worklets/plugin has to be listed last.\n\nWorklets Babel plugin comes with several customization options, you can explore what they are and how to use them in the Worklets docs section.\n\nWhy do I need this?\n\nClear Metro bundler cache (recommended)�\nNPM\nYARN\nnpm start -- --reset-cache\n\nAndroid�\n\nNo additional steps are necessary.\n\niOS�\n\nWhile developing for iOS, make sure to install pods first before running the app:\n\ncd ios && pod install && cd ..\n\nWeb�\n\nFor building apps that target web using react-native-web we highly recommend to use Expo.\n\nTo use Reanimated on the web all you need to do is to install and add @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from Babel plugin to your babel.config.js.\n\nNPM\nYARN\nnpm install @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from\n\n  module.exports = {\n      presets: [\n        ... // don't add it here :)\n      ],\n      plugins: [\n          ...\n\n          '@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from',\n\n          'react-native-worklets/plugin',\n      ],\n  };\n\n\nMake sure to list react-native-worklets/plugin last.\n\nMore advanced use cases such as running Reanimated with webpack or with Next.js are explained in a separate Web Support guide.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nFundamentals\nNEXT\nYour First Animation\nWhat is React Native Reanimated?\nPrerequisites\nInstallation\nStep 1: Install the package\nStep 2: Rebuild native dependencies\nReact Native Community CLI\n\nReduce context switching & preview components instantly.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Then, in the following sections, we're going to build on top of this knowledge and further expand your skills. Let's go!\n\nUsing an Animated component�\n\nLet's start by having something that we could see on the screen. First, to create an animatable component you need to import an Animated object:\n\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\n\nThis Animated object wraps React Native built-ins such as View, ScrollView or FlatList.\n\nYou use these components as any other JSX components:\n\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n\n    <Animated.View\n\n      style={{\n        width: 100,\n        height: 100,\n        backgroundColor: 'violet',\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nINFO\n\nYou can create your own custom Animated components with createAnimatedComponent.\n\nDefining a shared value�\n\nA shared value is a driving factor of all your animations. You can think of it as a React state which is automagically kept in sync between the “JavaScript” and the “native” side of your app (hence the name). You create shared values using a useSharedValue hook:\n\nimport { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\n\nAs with any other React hook, you need to define it in your component's body. In a shared value, you can store any JS value like number, string or boolean but also data structures such as array and object.\n\nFor now, let's use 100 as the default value of the useSharedValue hook and pass the returned value as an inline style of the Animated.View:\n\nimport Animated, { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const width = useSharedValue(100);\n\n\n  return (\n    <Animated.View\n      style={{\n\n        width,\n\n        height: 100,\n        backgroundColor: 'violet',\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nUsing a shared value�\n\nLet's create a very simple animation that will animate a width of an element. We'll make it expand by 50px on each button press. We can do this by modifying a shared value connected to the width property of an Animated.View component. I know it might sound complicated, but it's actually quite simple.\n\nValues stored in shared values are accessed and modified by their .value property.\n\nThere's no setter or anything - you simply mutate the .value property like there's no tomorrow.\n\nLet's define a handlePress function inside of which we'll modify the shared value:\n\nimport { Button, View } from 'react-native';\nimport Animated, { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const width = useSharedValue(100);\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n\n    width.value = Math.random() * 100 + 50;\n\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center' }}>\n      <Animated.View\n        style={{\n          width,\n          height: 100,\n          backgroundColor: 'violet',\n        }}\n      />\n\n      <Button onPress={handlePress} title=\"Click me\" />\n\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nCAUTION\n\nIt's a common mistake to modify a shared value directly like this: sv = sv + 100;. Always remember to access the shared value by using the .value property instead. Here, the correct usage would be sv.value = sv.value + 100;.\n\nUsing an animation function�\n\nFinally, import withSpring function and wrap around Math.random() * 100 + 50 in the handlePress function so that the value which withSpring returns modifies the shared value. This will create a bouncy spring animation that transitions the width of the element from its current value (here width.value) to the new one (here Math.random() * 100 + 50).\n\nimport { Button, View } from 'react-native';\n\nimport Animated, { useSharedValue, withSpring } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const width = useSharedValue(100);\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n\n    width.value = withSpring(Math.random() * 100 + 50);\n\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center' }}>\n      <Animated.View\n        style={{\n          width,\n          height: 100,\n          backgroundColor: 'violet',\n        }}\n      />\n      <Button onPress={handlePress} title=\"Click me\" />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\n\nAnd voilà, we've made our first animation using Reanimated!

Now, we'll learn a different way of passing animation styles to components. We'll also go over the difference between animating styles and props and how to handle them using useAnimatedStyle and useAnimatedProps.\n\nAnimating styles�\n\nAs we learned in the previous section we can animate styles by passing shared values inline to the elements' style property:\n\nimport Animated, { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const width = useSharedValue(100);\n\n  return <Animated.View style={{ width }} />;\n}\n\n\nIn basic cases, this syntax works well but it has one big downside. It doesn't allow to access the value stored in a shared value. For example, it's not possible to build more complex animations by using inline styling to multiply this value (or do any other mathematical operation) before assigning it to the style prop.\n\n<Animated.View style={{ width: width * 5 }} /> // this won't work\n\n\nLet's suppose we have an example with a box which moves to the right on every button press:\n\nimport { View, Button } from 'react-native';\nimport Animated, { useSharedValue, withSpring } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const translateX = useSharedValue(0);\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n\n    translateX.value = withSpring(translateX.value + 50);\n\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, { transform: [{ translateX }] }]} />\n\n      <Button onPress={handlePress} title=\"Click me\" />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\n\nIf we would like to customize how our shared value changes based on some user input, (e.g. multiplying it by 2 or following some other mathematical equation) we couldn't use inline styling.\n\nLuckily, the useAnimatedStyle hook comes to the rescue. It adds additional control and flexibility over your animation. This can be really useful when creating a bit more complicated animations which include conditional statements or loops.\n\nLet's see it in action:\n\nExpand the full code\nexport default function App() {\n  const translateX = useSharedValue<number>(0);\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n    translateX.value += 50;\n  };\n\n\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n\n    transform: [{ translateX: withSpring(translateX.value * 2) }],\n\n  }));\n\n\n  return (\n    <>\n\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyles]} />\n\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Button onPress={handlePress} title=\"Click me\" />\n      </View>\n    </>\n  );\n\n\nuseAnimatedStyle lets you access the value stored in a shared value. Thanks to that we could multiply the value by 2 before assigning it to style. This hook has one more advantage over passing animations to inline styles. It allows you to keep all the animation-related logic in one place.\n\nYou can see it in action in the example below:\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nCLICK ME\nAnimating props�\n\nMost of the values that developers animate (width, color, transform etc.) are modified by passing them as an object to the style property of an element. But that's not always the case.\n\nSometimes we'd like to animate not just styles but also the props which are passed to the component.\n\nFor example, let's say we would like to animate SVG elements. Instead of passing values to the style property, values are defined as props:\n\n<Circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"10\" fill=\"blue\" />\n\n\nReanimated comes with just a handful of built-in components like Animated.View or Animated.ScrollView. For components which aren't a part of Reanimated, to make their props animatable, we need to wrap them with createAnimatedComponent:\n\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\nimport { Circle } from 'react-native-svg';\n\nconst AnimatedCircle = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Circle);\n\n\nTo animate the radius of the SVG circle we can simply pass the shared value as a prop:\n\nimport { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';\nimport { Svg } from 'react-native-svg';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const r = useSharedValue(10);\n\n  return (\n    <Svg>\n\n      <AnimatedCircle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r={r} fill=\"blue\" />\n\n    </Svg>\n  );\n}\n\n\nThis approach works just fine but same as useAnimatedStyle for animating styles we can encapsulate the animation logic and gain access to the .value property of a shared value by using useAnimatedProps.\n\nSo if we'd like to smoothly increase the radius of a circle by 10px on each button press we could use useAnimatedProps:\n\nExpand the full code\nconst AnimatedCircle = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Circle);\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const r = useSharedValue<number>(20);\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n    r.value += 10;\n  };\n\n\n  const animatedProps = useAnimatedProps(() => ({\n\n    r: withTiming(r.value),\n\n  }));\n\n\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <Svg style={styles.svg}>\n        <AnimatedCircle\n          cx=\"50%\"\n          cy=\"50%\"\n          fill=\"#b58df1\"\n\n          animatedProps={animatedProps}\n\n        />\n      </Svg>\n      <Button onPress={handlePress} title=\"Click me\" />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\n\nIn a function which useAnimatedProps takes as an argument, we return an object with all the props we'd like to animate. Then we can pass the value which useAnimatedProps returns to the animatedProps prop of an Animated component.\n\nCheck out the full example below:\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences.

To sum up:\n\nPassing shared values to inline styles is a simple way of creating animations but it has some limitations.\nDifference between animating props and styles is that props are not passed to the style object, but rather as separate props of the component.\nBy using useAnimatedStyle and useAnimatedProps, you can access the value stored in a shared value. This can add additional control over the animation.\nYou can make your own animatable components by wrapping them with Animated.createAnimatedComponent.\nWhat's next?�\n\nIn the next section, we'll learn more about animation functions and how to customize their behavior.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nYour First Animation\nNEXT\nCustomizing animations\nAnimating styles\nAnimating props\nSummary\nWhat's next?\n\nPreview React Native components in isolation.\n\nTry Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

We think now you're more than ready to dive deeper into customizing animations!\n\nReanimated comes with three built-in animation functions: withTiming, withSpring, and withDecay. For now, let's focus on the first two, and we'll come back to withDecay in the Handling gestures section.\n\nIt's very easy to customize the behavior of animation functions in Reanimated. You can do this by passing a config object to the second parameter of either withTiming or withSpring function.\n\nConfiguring withTiming�\n\nThe config parameter of withTiming comes with two properties: duration and easing.\n\nimport { withTiming, Easing } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nwithTiming(sv.value, {\n  duration: 300,\n  easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.quad),\n});\n\n\nSimple enough, the duration parameter defines how long in milliseconds the animation should take to reach the assigned toValue. The duration by default is set to 300 milliseconds.\n\nThe easing parameter lets you fine-tune the animation over the specified time. For example, you can make the animation start slowly then pickup some speed and slow it down again towards the end. This value defaults to Easing.inOut(Easing.quad).\n\nIt all will start to make sense when you compare side by side a linear easing with the default easing.\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nINOUT\nLINEAR\n\nReanimated comes with a handful of predefined easing functions. You can play around with them in the interactive playground below or check the full withTiming API reference.\n\nwithTiming interactive playground\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences.

It makes it look like the object you're animating is connected to a real spring. The physics-based approach makes the animations look believable.\n\nMost of the time when tinkering with springs you'll be adjusting one of these three properties: mass, stiffness (also known as tension), and damping (also known as friction).\n\nimport { withSpring } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nwithSpring(sv.value, {\n  mass: 1,\n  stiffness: 100,\n  damping: 10,\n});\n\n\nThe mass of a spring influences how hard is it to make an object move and to bring it to a stop. Mass adds a feeling of inertia to the object you're trying to move. You can see in the playground that the spring with greater mass moves more \"sluggish\" compared to the default configuration.\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nDEFAULT\nHEAVY\n\nStiffness affects how bouncy the spring is. As an example, think about the difference between a steel spring (with very high stiffness) and a spring made out of soft plastic (with low stiffness).\n\nDamping describes how quickly the spring animation finishes. Higher damping means the spring will come to rest faster. In the real world, you could think about the same spring bouncing in the air and underwater. For example, a spring in a vacuum would have zero friction and thus zero damping.\n\nReanimated comes with a handful of other properties used to customize your spring animation. You can play around with them in our interactive playground or check the full withSpring API reference.\n\nwithSpring interactive playground\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences.

To sum up:\n\nBoth withTiming and withSpring functions take the config object as a second parameter.\nYou can adjust withTiming behavior with duration and easing properties. For your convenience Reanimated comes with a built-in Easing module.\nSome of the properties which adjust the behavior of withSpring are mass, stiffness and damping.\nWhat's next?�\n\nIn the upcoming section, you'll discover how to use animation modifiers such as withSequence and withRepeat.

Reanimated comes with three built-in modifiers: withRepeat, withSequence, and withDelay.\n\nLet's build a simple shake animation which uses all the modifiers and learn them along the way. Let's go!\n\nStarting point�\n\nIn this example, we're going to make an animated box which will shake on a button press after a slight delay.\n\nLet's start by having an Animated.View and a Button which moves the view to the right on press. To achieve this we can use useAnimatedStyle and withTiming function to smoothly animate our box 40px to the right.\n\nIf this sounds new to you, no worries! Start by going through the basics in Your First Animation and come back here when you're ready.\n\nExpand the full code\nexport default function App() {\n  const offset = useSharedValue<number>(0);\n\n\n  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n\n    transform: [{ translateX: offset.value }],\n\n  }));\n\n\n  const OFFSET = 40;\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n\n    offset.value = withTiming(OFFSET);\n\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, style]} />\n\n      <Button title=\"shake\" onPress={handlePress} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nSHAKE\nRepeating an animation�\n\nTo implement our desired shake animation we can use withRepeat modifier. This modifier lets you repeat a provided animation.\n\nimport { withRepeat } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  sv.value = withRepeat(withTiming(50), 5);\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nPass a number to the second parameter of the function to make it repeat a given number of times. You can make it repeat forever by passing a non-positive value (eg. 0 or -1). You can make the animation go back and forth by passing true to the third (i.e. reverse) argument.\n\nTo learn more about it you can check out the full withRepeat API reference.\n\nLet's use this function in our example:\n\nExpand the full code\nexport default function App() {\n  const offset = useSharedValue<number>(0);\n\n  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    transform: [{ translateX: offset.value }],\n  }));\n\n  const OFFSET = 40;\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n\n    offset.value = withRepeat(withTiming(OFFSET), 5, true);\n\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, style]} />\n      <Button title=\"shake\" onPress={handlePress} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\n\nWhen we run this code we can see that the box jiggles left to right between the set offset and a starting position. After the animation finishes the box doesn't come back to its initial place. It's not really how we imagined a shake animation but we'll get there in a second!\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nSHAKE\nRunning animations in a sequence�\n\nOne way to improve our animation is to start it with a left offset and reset it back to starting position after the animation ends. That's a perfect use case for the withSequence modifier.\n\nimport { withSequence } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  sv.value = withSequence(withTiming(50), withTiming(0));\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nThis modifier lets you chain animations together. The next animation starts when the previous one ends. You use it by passing animations as arguments in the order you want them to run.\n\nTo learn more about it you can check out the full withSequence API reference.\n\nComing back to our example - we can utilize withSequence to improve our animation. First, we'll sway the box to the left which we'll make it to take half of the duration of one swing. Then, we'll shake the box 5 times and finish up the animation by bringing it to starting position also with half of the animation duration.\n\nExpand the full code\n  const TIME = 250;\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n\n    offset.value = withSequence(\n\n      // start from -OFFSET\n      withTiming(-OFFSET, { duration: TIME / 2 }),\n      // shake between -OFFSET and OFFSET 5 times\n      withRepeat(withTiming(OFFSET, { duration: TIME }), 5, true),\n      // go back to 0 at the end\n      withTiming(0, { duration: TIME / 2 })\n\n    );\n\n  };\n\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nSHAKE\nStarting the animation with delay�\n\nAs a cherry on top, we'll add a little bit of suspense by adding a slight delay before the animation begins. For this exact purpose, Reanimated comes with a withDelay modifier.\n\nimport { withDelay } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  sv.value = withDelay(500, withTiming(0));\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nThis function as a first parameter takes the duration in milliseconds before the animation starts. The second parameter defines the animation to delay.\n\nTo learn more about it you can check out the full withDelay API reference.\n\nExpand the full code\n  const OFFSET = 40;\n  const TIME = 250;\n  const DELAY = 400;\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n\n    offset.value = withDelay(\n\n      DELAY,\n\n      withSequence(\n        // start from -OFFSET\n        withTiming(-OFFSET, { duration: TIME / 2 }),\n        // shake between -OFFSET and OFFSET 5 times\n        withRepeat(withTiming(OFFSET, { duration: TIME }), 5, true),\n        // go back to 0 at the end\n        withTiming(0, { duration: TIME / 2 })\n      )\n\n    );\n\n  };\n\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences.

To achieve this, Reanimated integrates tightly with React Native Gesture Handler, another library created by Software Mansion.\n\nGesture Handler comes with plentiful gestures like Pinch or Fling. Right now we'll start simple and get to know Tap and Pan gestures as well as how to use withDecay animation function.\n\nJust make sure to go through the Gesture Handler installation steps first and come back here to learn how to use it with Reanimated.\n\nHandling tap gestures�\n\nLet's start with the simplest gesture - tapping. Tap gesture detects fingers touching the screen for a short period of time. You can use them to implement custom buttons or pressable elements from scratch.\n\nIn this example, we'll create a circle that will grow and change color on touch.\n\nFirst, let's wrap our app with GestureHandlerRootView. Make sure to keep the GestureHandlerRootView as close to the actual root view as possible. That'll ensure that our gestures will work as expected with each other.\n\nimport { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n      {/* rest of the app */}\n    </GestureHandlerRootView>\n  );\n}\n\n\nNew tap gestures are defined with Gesture.Tap() in your component's body. You can define the behavior of the gesture by chaining methods like onBegin, onStart, onEnd, or onFinalize on the gesture. We'll use them to update a shared value just after the gesture begins and return to the initial value when the gesture finishes.\n\nExpand the full code\nexport default function App() {\n  const pressed = useSharedValue<boolean>(false);\n\n  const tap = Gesture.Tap()\n    .onBegin(() => {\n      pressed.value = true;\n    })\n    .onFinalize(() => {\n      pressed.value = false;\n    });\n\n\nYou can safely access the shared values because callbacks passed to gestures are automatically workletized for you.\n\nWe'd like our circle to change color from violet to yellow and smoothly scale by 20% on tap. Let's define that animation logic using withTiming in the useAnimatedStyle:\n\nExpand the full code\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    backgroundColor: pressed.value ? '#FFE04B' : '#B58DF1',\n    transform: [{ scale: withTiming(pressed.value ? 1.2 : 1) }],\n  }));\n\n\nYou need to pass your defined gesture to the gesture prop of the GestureDetector component. That component should wrap the view you'd like to handle gestures on. Also, remember to pass the defined animatedStyles to the view you want to animate like so:\n\nExpand the full code\n  return (\n    <GestureHandlerRootView style={styles.container}>\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n\n        <GestureDetector gesture={tap}>\n\n          <Animated.View style={[styles.circle, animatedStyles]} />\n\n        </GestureDetector>\n\n      </View>\n    </GestureHandlerRootView>\n  );\n}\n\n\nAnd that's it! Pretty straightforward, isn't it? Let's see it in its full glory in an interactive example:\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nTap the circle\n\nYou can make use of composing gestures to more complex behaviors. But what if we'd like to create something a bit more interesting?\n\nHandling pan gestures�\n\nLet's spice things up a bit by making the circle draggable and have it bounce back to its starting position when released. Let's also keep the color highlight and scale effect we've added in the previous example. Implementing this behavior it's not possible with just a simple tap gesture. We need to reach for a pan gesture instead.\n\nLuckily, all the gestures share a similar API so implementing this is nearly as easy as renaming the Tap gesture to Pan and chaining an additional onChange method.\n\nExpand the full code\n\n\n  const offset = useSharedValue<number>(0);\n\n  const pan = Gesture.Pan()\n    .onBegin(() => {\n      pressed.value = true;\n    })\n\n    .onChange((event) => {\n\n      offset.value = event.translationX;\n\n    })\n\n    .onFinalize(() => {\n\n      offset.value = withSpring(0);\n\n      pressed.value = false;\n\n\nThe callback passed to onChange comes with some event data that has a bunch of handy properties. One of them is translationX which indicates how much the object has moved on the X axis. We stored that in a shared value to move the circle accordingly. To make the circle come back to its initial place all you have to do is to reset the offset.value in the onFinalize method. We can use withSpring or withTiming functions to make it come back with an animation.\n\nAll that's left to do is to adjust the logic in useAnimatedStyle to handle the offset.\n\nExpand the full code\n\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    transform: [\n\n      { translateX: offset.value },\n\n      { scale: withTiming(pressed.value ? 1.2 : 1) },\n    ],\n    backgroundColor: pressed.value ? '#FFE04B' : '#b58df1',\n  }));\n\n\nYou can play around with the example below and see how the circle changes and reacts to the gesture:\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nGrab and drag the circle\nUsing withDecay�\n\nRemember when some time ago we said that we'll come back to withDecay? Now this is the time!\n\nwithDecay lets you retain the velocity of the gesture and animate with some deceleration. That means when you release a grabbed object with some velocity you can slowly bring it to stop. Sounds complicated but it really isn't!\n\nSimply pass the final velocity in onFinalize method to the velocity property of withDecay function and let Reanimated handle it for you. To retain the new position of an object update the change on the X axis in onChange method like so:\n\nExpand the full code\n\n  const pan = Gesture.Pan()\n    .onChange((event) => {\n\n      offset.value += event.changeX;\n\n    })\n    .onFinalize((event) => {\n      offset.value = withDecay({\n        velocity: event.velocityX,\n        rubberBandEffect: true,\n        clamp: [\n          -(width.value / 2) + SIZE / 2 + BOUNDARY_OFFSET,\n          width.value / 2 - SIZE / 2 - BOUNDARY_OFFSET,\n\n\nThe rest of the code is just to make sure the square stays inside the screen.\n\nPlay around and see how the square decelerates when let go with some speed!\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nGrab and release the square\n\nMake sure to check the full withDecay API reference to get to know the rest of the configuration options.\n\nSummary�\n\nIn this section, we went through the basics of handling gestures with Reanimated and Gesture Handler. We learned about Tap and Pan gestures and withDecay function. To sum up:\n\nReanimated integrates with a different package called React Native Gesture Handler to provide seamless interactions.\nWe create new gestures, such as Gesture.Pan() or Gesture.Tap(), and pass them to GestureDetector, which has to wrap the element we want to handle interactions on.\nYou can access and modify shared values inside gesture callbacks without any additional boilerplate.\nwithDecay lets you create decelerating animations based on velocity coming from a gesture.\nWhat's next?�\n\nIn this article, we've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with gestures in Reanimated. Besides Tap and Pan gestures Gesture Handler comes with many more e.g. Pinch or Fling. We welcome you to dive into the Quick start section of the React Native Gesture Handler documentation and explore all the possibilities that this library comes with.\n\nIn the next section, Let's explore a glossary of terms together!\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nApplying modifiers\nNEXT\nGlossary of terms\nHandling tap gestures\nHandling pan gestures\nUsing withDecay\nSummary\nWhat's next?\n\nAn all-in-one IDE for Expo & React Native.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Reanimated comes with just a handful of built-in components like Animated.View, Animated.Text, or Animated.ScrollView.\n\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Animated.View\n      style={{\n        width: 100,\n        height: 100,\n        backgroundColor: 'violet',\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nFor components which aren't a part of Reanimated, to make their props and styles animatable, you have to wrap them with createAnimatedComponent:\n\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\nimport { Circle } from 'react-native-svg';\n\nconst AnimatedCircle = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Circle);\n\nShared value�\n\nShared values are a driving factor of all your animations in Reanimated.\n\nThey are defined using useSharedValue hook:\n\nimport { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\n\nand accessed and modified by their .value property:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const sv = useSharedValue(0);\n\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n\n    sv.value += 10;\n\n  };\n\n  // rest of your glamorous code ✨\n}\n\n\nIt can be a value of any type. When used, the data stored in a shared value is automatically synchronized between the JavaScript thread and the UI thread.\n\nAnimatable value�\n\nAn animatable value refers to a type of value that can be used for animations. These values include numbers, strings, and arrays of numbers.\n\nString values can be animated if they are in a specific format, such as \"10deg\", \"21%\", or even colors like \"#ffaabb\" or \"rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.7)\".\n\nAnimation function�\n\nAnimation functions are functions which let you create animations. They are building blocks that describe how your animations should behave.\n\nReanimated comes with 3 built-in animation functions:\n\nwithSpring lets you create spring-based animation\nwithTiming lets you create an animation based on duration and easing\nwithDecay lets you create animations that mimic objects in motion that move with a given deceleration rate\n\nThese functions can be combined with animation modifiers to create rich and complex animations.\n\nAnimation modifier�\n\nAnimation modifiers are functions used to customize animations. Also known as higher-order animations.\n\nReanimated comes with 3 built-in modifiers:\n\nwithDelay lets you add a delay before the animation starts\nwithRepeat lets you repeat an animation certain number of times\nwithSequence lets you chain animation one after the other\nwithClamp lets you limit the animation boundaries to a specified range\nAnimation object�\n\nAn animation object is a value returned from animation functions and modifiers which holds the current state of the animation including its start and end conditions, as well as a onFrame function. These values allow to calculate the animation state for each frame.\n\nWhen you pass an animation object to a shared value it is automatically treated as an animatable value.\n\nFor example, consider this code:\n\nsv.value = withSpring(100);\n\n\nEven though, the withSpring returns an animation object the final result that is stored in a shared value is just a number.\n\nAnimations in inline styling�\n\nPassing shared values directly to style property without the use of useAnimatedStyle.\n\nFor example:\n\nfunction App() {\n  const width = useSharedValue(100);\n\n  return <Animated.View style={{ width }} />;\n}\n\nLayout animation modifier�\n\nLayout animation modifiers are methods used to customize layout animations.\n\n<Animated.View entering={FadeOutLeft.duration(500).easing(Easing.ease)} />\n\n\nReanimated comes with plenty of built-in layout animation modifiers. Some of them are:\n\n.duration(durationMs: number) - the length of the animation (in milliseconds).\n.easing(easingFunction: EasingFunction) - an easing function which defines the animation curve.\n.springify() - enables the spring-based animation configuration.\n.damping(value: number) - decides how quickly a spring stops moving.\n.withCallback(callback: (finished: boolean) => void) - the callback that will fire after the animation ends.\n\nFor a list of all available modifiers for each animation refer to the documentation of individual layout animation.\n\nWorklet�\n\nWorklets are short-running JavaScript functions that can be run on the UI thread. They can also be run on a JavaScript thread just as you would run a function in your code.\n\nMost of the time when working with Reanimated the code is automatically workletized and run on the UI thread by default.\n\nconst style = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n  console.log('Running on the UI thread');\n  return { opacity: 0.5 };\n});\n\n\nYou can create your own worklets using the \"worklet\"; directive at the top of a function.\n\nfunction myWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log('Running on the UI thread');\n}\n\n\nrunOnUI lets you manually run worklets on the UI thread:\n\nfunction myWorklet(greeting) {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log(`${greeting} from the UI thread`);\n}\n\nfunction onPress() {\n\n  runOnUI(myWorklet)('Howdy');\n\n}\n\nto workletize�\n\nTo convert a JavaScript function into a serializable object which can be copied and run over on UI thread.\n\nFunctions marked with \"worklet\" directive are automatically picked up and workletized by the Worklets Babel plugin.\n\nJavaScript thread�\n\nJavaScript thread (or JS thread for short) is responsible for handling JavaScript code execution in the app.\n\nThis is the primary place where the React Native app code is executed.\n\nUI thread�\n\nUI thread is responsible for handling user interface updates. Also known as Main thread.\n\nYou can learn more about it by reading the Threading model article in the official React Native docs.\n\nWorklets Babel plugin�\n\nThe plugin performs automatic workletization of certain functions used with Reanimated to reduce the amount of boilerplate code.\n\nYou can learn the details by reading the Worklets docs.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nHandling gestures\nNEXT\nCSS Transitions\nAnimated component\nShared value\nAnimatable value\nAnimation function\nAnimation modifier\nAnimation object\nAnimations in inline styling\nLayout animation modifier\nWorklet\nto workletize\nJavaScript thread\nUI thread\nWorklets Babel plugin\n\nRun, preview, and debug apps faster.\n\nTry our IDE for React Native\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Access to value property or calling get/set methods is a side-effect. Triggering side-effects during render violates the Rules of React. All reads from and writes to a shared value should happen in relevant callbacks which aren't executed during render, i.e. in useAnimatedStyle or useEffect hooks.\n\nWhen you change the sv.value Reanimated will update the styles and keep the shared value in sync between the threads. However, this won't trigger a typical React re-render because a shared value is a plain JavaScript object.\n\nWhen you read the sv.value on the JavaScript thread, the thread will get blocked until the value is fetched from the UI thread. In most cases it will be negligible, but if the UI thread is busy or you are reading a value multiple times, the wait time needed to synchronize both threads may significantly increase.\n\nWhen you change the sv.value the update will happen synchronously on the UI thread. On the other hand, on the JavaScript thread the update is asynchronous. This means when you try to immediately log the value after the change it will log the previously stored value.\n\nfunction App() {\n  const sv = useSharedValue(100); // initially set 100\n\n  sv.value += 50; // changing value stored in a shared value\n\n  console.log(sv.value); // will still log 100\n}\n\nStay away from destructuring assignment when working with shared values. While this is a completely valid JavaScript code it will make Reanimated unable to keep the reactivity of a shared value.\nfunction App() {\n  let { value } = sv; // don't do this\n\n  console.log(value); // you can read the value just fine\n\n  value += 50; // but this won't update the styles\n}\n\nWhen storing objects in a shared value, make sure to reassign an object instead of changing the properties individually.\nfunction App() {\n  const sv = useSharedValue({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n\n  sv.value.x = 50; // Reanimated loses reactivity 🚨\n\n  sv.value = { x: 50, y: 0 }; // ✅\n}\n\nWhen storing large arrays or complex objects in a shared value, you can use .modify method to alter the existing value instead of creating a new one.\nfunction App() {\n  const sv = useSharedValue([1, 2, 3]);\n\n  sv.value.push(1000); // Reanimated loses reactivity 🚨\n\n  sv.value = [...sv.value, 1000]; // works, but creates a new copy ⚠️\n\n  sv.modify((value) => {\n    'worklet';\n    value.push(1000); // ✅\n    return value;\n  });\n}\n\nPlatform compatibility�\nAndroid\tiOS\tWeb\n✅\t✅\t✅\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nCore\nNEXT\nuseAnimatedStyle\nReference\nArguments\nReturns\nExample\nRemarks\nPlatform compatibility\n\nPreview React Native components in isolation.\n\nTry Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Styles are automatically updated whenever an associated shared value or React state changes.\n\nIn contrast to the inline styling, useAnimatedStyle allows to access values stored in shared values in the styles object it defines.\n\nFor animating properties use useAnimatedProps instead.\n\nReference�\nimport { useAnimatedStyle } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n\n    return {\n      opacity: sv.value ? 1 : 0,\n    };\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  return <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyles]} />;\n\n}\n\n\nType definitions\n\nArguments�\nupdater�\n\nA function returning an object with style properties you want to animate. You can animate any style property available in React Native.\n\ndependencies Optional�\n\nAn optional array of dependencies.\n\nOnly relevant when using Reanimated without the Babel plugin on the Web.\n\nReturns�\n\nuseAnimatedStyle returns an animated style object which has to be passed to the style property of an Animated component that you want to animate.\n\nuseAnimatedStyle mimics the behavior of StyleSheet as much as possible. updater callback returns a value that looks like a regular style object in which you can also use shared values.\n\nExample�\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nCLICK ME\nRemarks�\nAnimated styles take precedence over React Native's static styles. All values specified in animated styles override values from static styles.\nfunction App() {\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    width: sv.value,\n  }));\n\n  return (\n    <Animated.View\n      style={[\n\n        animatedStyles, // ⚠️ overrides the static style width\n\n        { width: 100 },\n\n      ]}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nAnimated styles don't follow the order in which they are specified in the style array. The last updated animated style is the one that takes effect.\n\nRemoving the animated style from the view doesn't unset values that were applied in the animated style. To unset these values, you need to manually set them to undefined in the animated style.\n\nMutating shared values in useAnimatedStyle's callback is an undefined behavior which may lead to infinite loops.\n\nfunction App() {\n  const sv = useSharedValue(0);\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n\n    sv.value = withTiming(1); // Don't do this!\n\n    return { opacity: sv.value };\n  });\n}\n\n\nYou can apply the value returned from useAnimatedStyle only to Animated components. Passing the animated styles to non-animated component will result in an error.\n\nOnly define the dynamic part of your styles with useAnimatedStyle and keep the static ones separately using StyleSheet API or (if you really have to) with inline styles. That way you avoid lots of unnecessary style recalculations. Static and dynamic styles can be easily merged using the [] syntax:\n\nfunction App() {\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    offset: sv.value,\n  }));\n\n\n  return <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyles]} />;\n\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  box: {\n    height: 120,\n    width: 120,\n    backgroundColor: '#b58df1',\n  },\n});\n\n\nYou can share animated styles between components to avoid code duplication.\n\nThe callback passed to the useAnimatedStyle is first run on the JavaScript thread and immediately after on the UI thread. This may cause an error if you write your code as if it's running on UI thread only. To avoid this, you can use the global._WORKLET variable to check if the code is running on the UI thread:\n\nfunction App() {\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n\n    if (global._WORKLET) {\n\n      // UI thread only code\n    } else {\n      // JS thread fallback code\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nPlatform compatibility�\nAndroid\tiOS\tWeb\n✅\t✅\t✅\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nuseSharedValue\nNEXT\nuseAnimatedProps\nReference\nArguments\nReturns\nExample\nRemarks\nPlatform compatibility\n\nReduce context switching & streamline React Native and Expo development.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

It can be used with React Native's scrollable components.\n\nReference�\nimport { useAnimatedScrollHandler } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const offsetY = useSharedValue(0);\n\n\n  const scrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler((event) => {\n\n    offsetY.value = event.contentOffset.y;\n\n  });\n\n\n  // ...\n\n  return <Animated.ScrollView onScroll={scrollHandler} />;\n}\n\n\nType definitions\n\nArguments�\nhandlers�\n\nObject containing custom keys matching native event names. Following keys are available:\n\nonScroll\nonBeginDrag\nonEndDrag\nonMomentumBegin\nonMomentumEnd\n\nThe values in the object should be individual worklets. Each of the worklet will be triggered when the corresponding event is dispatched on the connected Scrollable component.\n\nEach of the event worklets will receive the following parameters when called:\n\nevent - event object carrying the information about the scroll. The payload can differ depending on the type of the event. Please consult React Native's ScrollView documentation to learn about scroll event structure.\n\ncontext - plain JS object that can be used to store some state. This object will persist in between scroll event occurrences and you can read and write any data to it. When there are several event handlers provided in a form of an object of worklets, the context object will be shared in between the worklets allowing them to communicate with each other.\n\ndependencies Optional�\n\nAn optional array of dependencies.\n\nOnly relevant when using Reanimated without the Babel plugin on the Web.\n\nReturns�\n\nThe hook returns a handler object that can be hooked into a scrollable container. The returned handler should be passed under onScroll parameter regardless of whether it is configured to receive only scroll or also momentum or drag events. In order for the returned handler to be properly triggered, you should use containers that are wrapped with Animated (e.g. Animated.ScrollView and not just ScrollView).\n\nExample�\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nRemarks�\nThe returned handler may be passed to multiple components. In such situation, the handler will invoke for the given events each time any of the components dispatches them.\nIf a single worklet function of type (event) => void is passed instead of a map of functions matched to event keys, it's treated as a handler for the onScroll event.\nOnly onScroll event works on Web.\nPlatform compatibility�\nAndroid\tiOS\tWeb\n✅\t✅\t✅\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nuseScrollOffset\nNEXT\nDevice\nReference\nArguments\nReturns\nExample\nRemarks\nPlatform compatibility\n\nSet breakpoints and debug React Native apps with ease.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Quaternion is based on complex numbers and isn't easy to understand intuitively. They simplify interpolation between two rotations. Quaternions are oftentimes used in computer graphics because they don't suffer from a gimbal lock. Rotation sensor returns a quaternion in form of its components which are:\n\nqw: number - W component of the quaternion.\nqx: number - X component of the quaternion.\nqy: number - Y component of the quaternion.\nqz: number - Z component of the quaternion.\n\nand\n\ninterfaceOrientation: InterfaceOrientation.\n\nAll other sensors return an object with measurements in the x, y and z axes and the interface orientation:\n\nx - sensor measurement on the X axis.\ny - sensor measurement on the Y axis.\nz - sensor measurement on the Z axis.\ninterfaceOrientation: InterfaceOrientation.\n\nDepending on the sensor type the measurement is a number in radians per second, m/s2 or microtesla (μT).\n\nInterfaceOrientation is an enum containing these properties:\n\nROTATION_0 - default rotation on Android, portrait orientation on iOS.\nROTATION_90 - 90 degrees rotation on Android, landscape right orientation on iOS (landscape and home button on the right).\nROTATION_180 - 180 degrees rotation on Android, upside down orientation on iOS.\nROTATION_270 - 270 degrees rotation on Android, landscape left orientation on iOS (landscape and home button on the left).\nExample�\nExpand the full code\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const gravity = useAnimatedSensor(SensorType.GRAVITY);\n\n\n  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    return {\n      transform: [\n\n        { translateX: withSpring(gravity.sensor.value.x * 20) },\n\n        { translateY: withSpring(gravity.sensor.value.y * 20) },\n\n      ],\n    };\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyle]} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nRemarks�\n\nOn iOS, if you want to read sensor data you need to enable location services on your device (Settings > Privacy > Location Services).\n\nOn Web, the device needs to support sensors and your web application has to be connected over HTTPS.\n\nMost of the sensors operate in resolutions up to 100Hz.\n\nYou can read the sensor data on both UI thread and [JavaScript th(/docs/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread).\n\nPlatform compatibility�\nAndroid\tiOS\tWeb\n✅\t✅\t✅\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nuseAnimatedKeyboard\nNEXT\nuseReducedMotion\nReference\nArguments\nReturns\nExample\nRemarks\nPlatform compatibility\n\nStreamline your React Native & Expo development.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Please migrate to the react-native-keyboard-controller library. See the migration guide below.\n\nCAUTION\n\nAndroid implementation of useAnimatedKeyboard has drawbacks on Android SDK < 30, for more details see remarks section.\n\nReference�\nimport { useAnimatedKeyboard, useAnimatedStyle } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const keyboard = useAnimatedKeyboard();\n\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n    transform: [{ translateY: -keyboard.height.value }],\n  }));\n}\n\n\nType definitions\n\nArguments�\noptions Optional�\n\nOptional object containing additional configuration:\n\nisStatusBarTranslucentAndroid - removes top inset on Android i.e. to use translucent status bar on Android, set this option to true. Defaults to false. Ignored on iOS.\nReturns�\n\nHook useAnimatedKeyboard returns an object containing these fields:\n\nName\tType\tDescription\nheight\tSharedValue<number>\tA shared value containing current height of the keyboard.\nstate\tSharedValue<KeyboardState>\tA shared value containing current state of the keyboard. Possible states: { CLOSED, OPEN, CLOSING, OPENING }\nExample�\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nRemarks�\n\nOn Android, make sure to set android:windowSoftInputMode in your AndroidManifest.xml to adjustResize. Then, using the useAnimatedKeyboard hook disables the default Android behavior (resizing the view to accommodate keyboard) in the whole app. Using values from useAnimatedKeyboard hook you can handle the keyboard yourself. Unmounting all components that use useAnimatedKeyboard hook brings back the default Android behavior.\n\nOn Android, using the useAnimatedKeyboard hook expands root view to full screen (immersive mode) and takes control over insets management.\n\nWhen isStatusBarTranslucentAndroid is false it applies the top margin according to the insets.\n\nWhen isStatusBarTranslucentAndroid is true it sets top margin to 0.\n\nWhen isNavigationBarTranslucentAndroid is false it applies the bottom margin according to the insets.\n\nWhen isNavigationBarTranslucentAndroid is true it sets bottom margin to 0.\n\nOn Android, when using navigation with native header, isStatusBarTranslucentAndroid doesn't affect the top inset.\n\nOn Android SDK < 30, when status bar is hidden, the keyboard reverts to the default Android behavior.\n\nAvailable from 3.17.0 On iPad, when the keyboard is floating, the hook will always return height: 0 and state: CLOSED.\n\nPlatform compatibility�\nAndroid\tiOS\tWeb\n✅\t✅\t❌\nMigration guide�\n\nAs of react-native-reanimated 4.x the useAnimatedKeyboard hook has been deprecated due to persistent bugs on iOS 26. To address this, we recommend migrating to the react-native-keyboard-controller library, which offers a more robust and feature-complete solution for handling keyboard interactions. This guide walks you through the migration process.\n\nStep 1: Install react-native-keyboard-controller�\n\nFollow the official installation instructions in the installation guide.\n\nStep 2: Use a compatibility wrapper�\n\nTo make migration easier, you can use a compatibility layer. For that just replace your existing imports with the compat layer:\n\n- import { useAnimatedKeyboard, KeyboardState } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n+ import { useAnimatedKeyboard, KeyboardState } from 'react-native-keyboard-controller';\n\n\nAnd that’s it 🎉\n\nIf you run into any issues or edge cases, please open a ticket in the react-native-keyboard-controller repository.\n\nAlso consider exploring the built-in components - they can help reduce boilerplate and simplify your integration.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nDevice\nNEXT\nuseAnimatedSensor\nReference\nArguments\nReturns\nExample\nRemarks\nPlatform compatibility\nMigration guide\nStep 1: Install react-native-keyboard-controller\nStep 2: Use a compatibility wrapper\n\nAn all-in-one IDE for Expo & React Native.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

They allow you more flexibility than standard Entering and Exiting presets.\n\nReference�\nimport { Keyframe } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nconst keyframe = new Keyframe({\n  0: {\n    transform: [{ rotate: '0deg' }],\n  },\n  45: {\n    transform: [{ rotate: '100deg' }],\n    easing: Easing.exp,\n  },\n  100: {\n    transform: [{ rotate: '45deg' }],\n  },\n});\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <Animated.View entering={keyframe} />;\n}\n\n\nType definitions\n\nArguments�\ndefinitions�\n\nAn object, that contains definitions of your animation. The object keys should be within range 0-100 and correspond to animation progress. The object values should consist of style props and optionally of an easing function. If easing property is not provided, it defaults to Easing.linear.\n\nThe keys take the following values:\n\n0 or from: Initial state of the object.\nMiddle points (e.g., 45): Intermediate states of the object.\n100 or to: Final state of the object.\n\nThe key 0 (or from) should be assigned the style that you want for your object at the beginning of the animation.

Defaults to 500.\n.delay(durationMs: number) is the delay before the animation starts (in milliseconds). Defaults to 0.\n.reduceMotion(reduceMotion: ReduceMotion) determines how the animation responds to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.\n.withCallback(callback: (finished: boolean) => void) is the callback that will fire after the animation ends. Sets finished to true when animation ends without interruptions, and false otherwise.\nRemarks�\nProviding keyframe 0 or from is required as it contains the initial state of the object you want to animate.\nEnsure you provide the initial value for all style properties you want to animate in other keyframes.\nIf you want to add easing to an animation between two keyframes you have to pass it to the second one. As a result you should never provide any easing to keyframe 0.\nDo not provide both 0 and from, or 100 and to keyframes, as it will result in a parsing conflict.\nIf you want to animate transform style, make sure that all properties in the transformation array are in the same order in all keyframes.\nExample�\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences.

Due to that, playground doesn't cover springify() options but they can be applied to your animations on iOS and Android platforms.\n\nRemarks�\nWe recommend using layout animation builders outside of components or with useMemo to ensure the best performance.\nOn the New Architecture:\nnativeID is used internally to configure entering animations, so overwriting it will result in entering animations not running. Some components (e.g. TouchableWithoutFeedback) overwrite nativeID of its children. To work around this issue wrap your animated children with a View.\nremoving a non-animated view will trigger exiting animations in its children, but the non-animated view will not wait for the children's animations to finish. This is due to view flattening and can be mitigated by using collapsable={false}.\nFade�\n\nFadeX lets you create a fading animation.\n\nimport { FadeIn, FadeOut } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <Animated.View entering={FadeIn} exiting={FadeOut} />;\n}\n\n\nAvailable fade animations:\n\nEntering�\n\nFadeIn\n\nFadeInRight\n\nFadeInLeft\n\nFadeInUp\n\nFadeInDown\n\nExiting�\n\nFadeOut\n\nFadeOutRight\n\nFadeOutLeft\n\nFadeOutUp\n\nFadeOutDown\n\nInitial values\n\nModifiers�\nTime-based Optional�\n\nTime-based modifiers rely on withTiming function.\n\nFadeOutLeft.duration(500).easing(Easing.ease);\n\n.easing(easingFunction: EasingFunction) is an easing function which defines the animation curve.

Value 1 means the spring is critically damped, and value >1 means the spring is overdamped. Defaults to 0.5.\n.mass(value: number) is the weight of the spring. Reducing this value makes the animation faster. Defaults to 1.\n.rotate(degree: string) lets you rotate the element.\n.stiffness(value: number) decides how bouncy the spring is - the higher the number, the less bouncy it is. Defaults to 100.\n.overshootClamping(value: boolean) decides whether a spring can bounce over the designated position. Defaults to false.\n.energyThreshold(value: number) decides relative energy threshold below which the spring will snap without further oscillations. Defaults to 6e-9.\nCommon Optional�\nLinearTransition.delay(500)\n  .reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.Never)\n  .withInitialValues({ transform: [{ translateY: 420 }] })\n  .withCallback((finished) => {\n    console.log(`finished without interruptions: ${finished}`);\n  });\n\n.duration(duration: number) sets length of the animation (in milliseconds).

We are waiting for your feedback to improve the implementation.\n\nShared Element Transitions allow you to smoothly transform a component from one screen into a component on another screen.\n\nReference�\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nconst Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();\n\nfunction One({ navigation }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Animated.View\n\n        sharedTransitionTag=\"sharedTag\"\n\n      />\n      <Button title=\"Two\" onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Two')} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Two({ navigation }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Animated.View\n\n        sharedTransitionTag=\"sharedTag\"\n\n      />\n      <Button title=\"One\" onPress={() => navigation.navigate('One')} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function SharedElementExample() {\n  return (\n    <NavigationContainer>\n      <Stack.Navigator>\n        <Stack.Screen name=\"One\" component={One} />\n        <Stack.Screen name=\"Two\" component={Two} />\n      </Stack.Navigator>\n    </NavigationContainer>\n  );\n}\n\nOverview�\n\nWhen Reanimated detects that the current top screen on the stack changes, it checks if there are components with the same sharedTransitionTag on the new and old top screen.\n\nIf it finds two matching components, it hides both of them by changing their opacity and creates a third view, that is displayed over the view hierarchy, that looks exactly like the source view, and is then animated to look like the target view. This implementation detail is subject to change as we might want to avoid creating a redundant instance of the same component.\n\nAfter the animation is complete, the third view is removed, and the opacity of both original views is restored.\n\nCurrently you can't define a fully custom animation function. You can however customize the duration and use spring-based animations. You can expect width, height, originX, originY, transform, backgroundColor and opacity to be animated by default with a duration of 500 ms using the withTiming animation function.\n\nUsage�\n\nTo create a shared transition animation between two components on different screens, simply assign the same sharedTransitionTag to both components. When you navigate between screens, the shared transition animation will automatically play.\n\nIf you want to use more than one shared view on the same screen, be sure to assign a unique shared tag to each component.\n\nScreen A\n\n<Animated.View\n\n  sharedTransitionTag=\"sharedTag\"\n\n  style={{ width: 150, height: 150, backgroundColor: 'green' }}\n/>\n\n\nScreen B\n\n<Animated.View\n\n  sharedTransitionTag=\"sharedTag\"\n\n  style={{ width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'green' }}\n/>\n\nCustom animation�\n\nYou can customize the transition with the SharedTransition builder class. The available customization will be extended as the feature matures.\n\nimport { SharedTransition } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nconst transition = SharedTransition.duration(550).springify();\n\nfunction SharedView() {\n  return (\n    <Animated.View\n      sharedTransitionTag=\"reanimatedTransition\"\n\n      sharedTransitionStyle={transition}\n\n      style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', width: 200, height: 100 }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nOn iOS, when the animation is triggered by a swipe gesture or the OS back button we instead run a progress-based transition. This way the animation responds to the user swiping their finger accordingly, and allows for transition cancellation. This behavior will be possible to customize in the future.\n\nExample�\nExpand the full code\n      <Pressable onPress={() => goToDetails('countryside')}>\n        <Animated.View\n          sharedTransitionTag={'countryside'}\n          style={[\n            styles.imageOne,\n            { backgroundColor: gallery.countryside.color },\n          ]}\n        />\n      </Pressable>\n      <View style={styles.row}>\n        <Pressable onPress={() => goToDetails('florence')}>\n          <Animated.View\n            sharedTransitionTag={'florence'}\n            style={[\n              { width: width / 2 - 35 },\n              styles.imageTwo,\n              { backgroundColor: gallery.florence.color },\n            ]}\n          />\n        </Pressable>\n        <Pressable onPress={() => goToDetails('dawn')}>\n          <Animated.View\n            sharedTransitionTag={'dawn'}\n            style={[\n              { width: width / 2 - 35 },\n              styles.imageThree,\n              { backgroundColor: gallery.dawn.color },\n            ]}\n          />\n        </Pressable>\n      </View>\n\nCurrent limitations�\nOnly the native stack is supported.\nThe Tab navigator is not supported yet, using it in on path that uses shared transitions may result in no animation being ran.\nTransitions with native modals (using transparentModal) don't work properly on iOS (the modal is obstructing the Shared Element).\nYou can't define custom animation functions.\nSome properties (e.g. backgroundColor) are not supported in progress-based transitions.\nOn iOS you can encounter some issues with the vertical positioning of transitioning views. This is due to issues with header height information propagation.\nThere are some performance bottlenecks, that stem from transforms being recalculated too eagerly.\nWe have to use a workaround for react-native-screens to not keep a snapshot of the transitioning view on the popped screen. Currently the fix is available in 3.19+ versions.\nEnabling the feature flag causes the zIndex of views with exiting animations to change (they are brought to the front). This differs from the current behavior in Reanimated 4.\nSometimes on a fast refresh, the transition will run for elements that are on the same screen. It can happen when the navigator is wrapped with a context provider, and the native view that represents the screen changed, so the SET logic was triggered.\nPlatform Compatibility�\nAndroid\tiOS\tWeb\n✅\t✅\t❌\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nShared Element Transitions\nNEXT\nUtilities\nReference\nOverview\nUsage\nCustom animation\nExample\nCurrent limitations\nPlatform Compatibility\n\nRun, preview, and debug apps faster.\n\nTry our IDE for React Native\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Values in the input range should be increasing.\n\noutput�\n\nAn array of output colors values in form of strings (like 'red', '#ff0000', 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)' etc.). It should have at least the same number of points as the input range.\n\ncolorSpace Optional�\n\nThe color space to use for interpolation. Can be either 'HSV', 'RGB' or 'LAB'. Defaults to 'RGB'.\n\noptions Optional�\n\nColor interpolation options. Allowed parameters:\n\nOptions\tType\tDefault\tDescription\ngamma Optional\tnumber\t2.2\tGamma parameter used in gamma correction.\nuseCorrectedHSVInterpolation Optional\tboolean\ttrue\tWhether to reduce the number of colors the interpolation has to go through.\nOptions explanation�\ngamma - Colors on web / mobile are expressed in sRGB colorspace which is gamma-corrected, that is non-linear. Operations on colors in non-linear space like addition will give wrong results. For example the interpolated color may appear darker than it should. That's why when interpolating we convert sRGB to linear space first and then convert the result back into non-linear sRGB space. Gamma correction is device-dependent but for most devices to convert from non-linear to linear space raising components to the power of gamma=2.2 is a good approximation. If you'd like to disable that you can always set gamma=1. A nice article on that if you'd like to know more: https://observablehq.com/@sebastien/srgb-rgb-gamma\nuseCorrectedHSVInterpolation - Sometimes (for example when interpolating from yellow to purple) HSV interpolation goes through many other hues. This option allows to reduce the number of hues in such cases by treating HSV hues like a circular spectrum and choosing the shortest arc (so instead of going from yellow to purple through green and blue, it goes only through red).\nReturns�\n\ninterpolateColor returns the color after interpolation from within the output range in rgba(r, g, b, a) format.\n\nExample�\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences.

The animated ref has to be passed either to an Animated component or a React Native built-in component.\n\nReturns�\n\nmeasure returns an object containing these fields:\n\nx a number representing X coordinate relative to the parent component,\ny a number representing Y coordinate relative to the parent component,\nwidth a number representing the width of the component,\nheight a number representing the height of the component,\npageX a number representing X coordinate relative to the screen,\npageY a number representing Y coordinate relative to the screen,\n\nor returns null when the measurement couldn't be performed.\n\nExample�\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped. Learn more\n\nPreviewTSJS\nCLICK ME\nRemarks�\n\nmeasure is implemented only on the UI thread. When using measure inside event handlers, it has to be wrapped with the runOnUI function.\n\nThe useAnimatedStyle function is first evaluated on the JavaScript thread just before the views are attached to the native side. For this reason, to safely use the measure within useAnimatedStyle, a condition similar to the one below must be added to the code:\n\nfunction App() {\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n\n    if (_WORKLET) {\n\n      // safely use measure\n      const measurement = measure(animatedRef);\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n\nConsecutive runs of useAnimatedStyle are executed on the UI thread.\n\nWhen you only need the dimensions of the component and won't use the measurements during animation, consider using the onLayout property instead.\n\nSometimes, measure returns null (e.g., when the ref hasn't yet attached to the view). It's best to add a null check after the measurement for added safety.\n\nconst animatedRef = useAnimatedRef();\n\nconst handlePress = () => {\n  runOnUI(() => {\n    const measurement = measure(animatedRef);\n\n\n    if (measurement === null) {\n\n      return;\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n  })();\n};\n\n\nmeasure can be used only on rendered components. For instance, attempting to measure off-screen items in a FlatList will return a null value.\n\nmeasure isn't available with the Remote JS Debugger.

Technically, shared value is a mutable value with an automatic cleanup.\n\nAll remarks from the useSharedValue hook apply to makeMutable as well.\n\nDon't call makeMutable directly in the component scope. When component re-renders, it will create the completely new object (with the new initial value if it was changed) and the state of the previous mutable value will be lost.\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\n  const mv = makeMutable(counter); // 🚨 creates a new mutable value on each render\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const interval = setInterval(() => {\n      setCounter((prev) => prev + 1); // updates the counter stored in the component state\n    }, 1000);\n\n    return () => {\n      clearInterval(interval);\n    };\n  }, [mv]);\n\n  useAnimatedReaction(\n    () => mv.value,\n    (value) => {\n      console.log(value); // prints 0, 1, 2, ...\n    }\n  );\n}\n\nUse cancelAnimation to stop all animations running on the mutable value if it's no longer needed and there are still some animations running. Be super careful with infinite animations, as they will never stop unless you cancel them manually.\nfunction App() {\n  const mv = useMemo(() => makeMutable(0), []);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    mv.value = withRepeat(withSpring(100), -1, true); // creates an infinite animation\n\n    return () => {\n      cancelAnimation(mv); // ✅ stops the infinite animation on component unmount\n    };\n  }, []);\n}\n\nYou don't have to use cancelAnimation when the value is not animated. It will be garbage collected automatically when no more references to it exist.\nconst someFlag = makeMutable(false);\n\nfunction App() {\n  someFlag.value = true; // ✅ no need to cancel the animation later on\n}\n\nWhen you decide to use makeMutable, ensure that you follow Rules of React and avoid common useRef pitfalls, such as modifying the reference during rendering (see the Pitfall section in the useRef documentation for more details).\nComparison with useSharedValue�\nmakeMutable\tuseSharedValue\nCreates a new object on each call\tReuses the same object on each call\nIf initial value changes, a new object with the new value is created\tIf initialValue value changes, the initially created object is returned without any changes\nCan be used outside of the component scope\tCan be used only inside the component scope\nCan be used in loops (also when the number of iterations is not constant)\tCan be used in loops only if the number of rendered hooks (useSharedValue calls) is constant\nDoesn't automatically cancel animations when the component is unmounted\tAutomatically cancels animations when the component is unmounted\nPlatform compatibility�\nAndroid\tiOS\tWeb\n✅\t✅\t✅\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nsetNativeProps\nNEXT\nDebugging\nReference\nArguments\nReturns\nExample\nRemarks\nComparison with useSharedValue\nPlatform compatibility\n\nReduce context switching & streamline React Native and Expo development.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

These stacks can be misleading, as they often highlight code from Reanimated's internals rather than the misuse of the Reanimated API that is the source of the problem.\n\nTo address this, Reanimated provides a Metro configuration wrapper called wrapWithReanimatedMetroConfig. This wrapper automatically adjusts your Metro config to improve the accuracy of call stacks in warnings and errors generated by the Reanimated library.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nReference�\n\nTo enable more accurate call stacks, simply import wrapWithReanimatedMetroConfig from react-native-reanimated/metro-config and wrap your existing Metro configuration in the metro.config.js file with it.\n\n// metro.config.js\nconst {\n  wrapWithReanimatedMetroConfig,\n} = require('react-native-reanimated/metro-config');\n\nconst config = {\n  // Your existing Metro configuration options\n};\n\nmodule.exports = wrapWithReanimatedMetroConfig(config);\n\nExample�\n\nThe following example shows the difference in call stacks before and after applying the Reanimated Metro config wrapper. The Before image displays Reanimated source code as the error source, while the After image shows the actual incorrect code that caused the error.\n\nBefore\tAfter\n\t\nRemarks�\nThe wrapWithReanimatedMetroConfig doesn't remove any stack frames from the call stack; it only collapses irrelevant frames from Reanimated. If you want to inspect them, you can expand collapsed stack frames by pressing on the See N more frames text at the bottom of the Call Stack.\nCollapsed\tExpanded\n\t\nSome errors, particularly from asynchronous code, may still result in stack traces pointing to Reanimated internals instead of the exact problematic line in your code. This occurs because stack traces lose track of the original code that initiated the asynchronous operation. In such a case, you'll need to manually debug the issue based on the error message to identify the potential cause of the problem.\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nDebugging\nNEXT\nLogger configuration\nReference\nExample\nRemarks\n\nReduce context switching & preview components instantly.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Reanimated uses worklets to calculate view styles and react to events on the UI thread.\n\nDefining worklets�\n\nYou can create your own worklets using the 'worklet' directive at the top of a function.\n\nfunction myWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log('Hello from a worklet');\n}\n\nWorkletization�\n\nThe Worklets Babel plugin looks for functions marked with the 'worklet' directive and converts them into serializable objects. We call this process workletization. These objects can then be copied and run over on the UI thread.\n\nMost of the time when working with Reanimated and Gesture Handler the code is automatically workletized and run on the UI thread by default.\n\nimport { useAnimatedStyle } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    // Running on the UI thread\n    return { opacity: 0.5 };\n  });\n}\n\nRunning worklets on the UI Runtime (UI Thread)�\n\nYou can use scheduleOnUI to manually schedule worklet execution on the UI Runtime:\n\nfunction myWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log('Hello from the UI thread');\n}\n\nfunction onPress() {\n  scheduleOnUI(myWorklet);\n}\n\n\nYou can pass arguments to worklets.\n\nfunction myWorklet(greeting) {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log(`${greeting} from the UI thread`);\n}\n\nfunction onPress() {\n  scheduleOnUI(myWorklet, 'Howdy');\n}\n\nRunning functions from worklets�\n\nYou can run functions on the RN Runtime (JS thread) from the UI Runtime (UI thread) with scheduleOnRN. Most frequently used to call functions that aren't marked with a 'worklet'; directive (i.e. most third-party libraries) or to update the React state.\n\nimport { router } from 'expo-router';\nimport { Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const tap = Gesture.Tap().onEnd(() => {\n    // i'm a worklet too!\n\n    scheduleOnRN(router.back);\n\n  });\n}\n\n\nFunctions passed to scheduleOnRN must be defined in the JavaScript thread scope, i.e. in the component body or the global scope. This code won't work because myFunction is defined in the withTiming callback, which is only executed in the UI Runtime:\n\nfunction App() {\n  const tap = Gesture.Tap().onEnd(() => {\n    // myFunction is defined on the UI runtime 🚨\n    const myFunction = () => {};\n    scheduleOnRN(myFunction); // 💥\n  });\n}\n\nHoisting�\n\nFunctions marked with 'worklet' aren't hoisted. Besides affecting hoisting, the 'worklet' directive has no effect on the RN Runtime.\n\nCapturing closure�\n\nWorklets are closures. They can access variables declared outside of their own scope. Only variables referenced in the worklet body will be captured inside the worklet scope.\n\nconst width = 135.5;\n\nfunction otherWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log('Captured width is', width);\n}\n\n\nCapturing large JavaScript objects inside of a worklet can lead to performance issues.\n\nconst theme = {...}; // theme is a large object\n\nfunction myWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log(theme.color); // 🚨 referenced `color` but captured the whole `theme` object\n}\n\n\nYou can get around this problem by first assigning the prop you want to use to a separate variable.\n\nconst theme = {...};\nconst color = theme.color;\n\nfunction myWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log(color); // ✅ captured only `color`\n}\n\nPassing data to worklets�\n\nWorklets can return data within the same thread.\n\nfunction returningWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  return \"I'm back\"; // on the UI thread\n}\n\nfunction someWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  const what = returningWorklet(); // still on the UI thread\n  console.log('On the UI thread, other worklet says', what);\n}\n\n\nTo pass data between UI and JS thread we use shared values.\n\nimport { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const width = useSharedValue(100);\n\n  function myWorklet() {\n    'worklet';\n    width.value += 50;\n  }\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    console.log(width.value); // available on both JS and UI thread\n  }, []);\n}\n\nUsing worklets on the Web�\n\nThere's no separate UI thread available on the Web. Because of that, when Reanimated runs in the browser, worklets are resolved to plain JavaScript functions.\n\nHowever, the 'worklet' directive is still necessary on the Web, because Reanimated relies on the Worklets Babel plugin to capture dependencies inside worklet functions.\n\nOther worklet runtimes�\n\nWorklets can run in other runtimes than the one provided by React Native Worklets. For example VisionCamera and LiveMarkdown create their own worklet runtimes.\n\nYou can create your own worklet runtimes with createWorkletRuntime function.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nGuides\nNEXT\nAccessibility\nDefining worklets\nWorkletization\nRunning worklets on the UI Runtime (UI Thread)\nRunning functions from worklets\nHoisting\nCapturing closure\nPassing data to worklets\nUsing worklets on the Web\nOther worklet runtimes\n\nReduce context switching & preview components instantly.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Reanimated uses worklets to calculate view styles and react to events on the UI thread.\n\nAccessibility\n\nIn this section, we will explore how Reanimated provides support for enhanced accessibility in animations, particularly through its reduced motion functionality. This feature ensures a smoother experience for users who may have motion sensitivities or prefer less movement.\n\nBuilding for Android on Windows\n\nThis article provides basic troubleshooting steps for issues that may happen when building React Native apps with Reanimated for Android devices on Windows host machine.\n\nCompatibility\n\nReanimated 4 works only with the React Native New Architecture. If your app still uses the old architecture, you can use Reanimated in version 3 which is still actively maintained.\n\nContributing\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to Reanimated! From triaging and commenting on issues, through extending the documentation, to reviewing and sending Pull Requests, all contributions are more than welcome.\n\nDebugging worklets\n\nDue to Reanimated's unique architecture and usage of a second JS runtime, debugging\n\nFeature flags\n\nFeature flags allow developers to opt-in for experimental changes or opt-out from recent changes that have already been made default. Feature flags serve as a tool for incremental rollout of new implementation without affecting the general stability of the library, allowing to gather feedback from early adopters. There are two types of feature flags: static and dynamic.\n\nMigration from 1.x\n\nWe wanted to make it possible to migrate from Reanimated 1 to Reanimated 2 incrementally.\n\nMigration from 2.x\n\nReanimated 3.x doesn't introduce any breaking changes between 2.x and 3.x in terms of the API. All the code you've written in Reanimated v2 API works in 3.x without any changes. However, Reanimated 3.x drops the Reanimated v1 API entirely. For the migration guide between 1.x and 2.x versions please consult Migration from 1.x to 2.x.\n\nMigration from 3.x\n\nBreaking changes\n\nPerformance\n\nThis guide covers recommended practices and tips to achieve the best performance with Reanimated.\n\nSupported style properties\n\nNot all CSS properties are available and animatable in React Native. The following table describes which style properties can be animated on which platform.\n\nTesting with Jest\n\nReanimated provides testing API, based on Jest. It allows user to mock web-based animations.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nInitialization issues\n\nWeb Support\n\nIt's possible to launch Reanimated in a web browser.

For a given animation, the value can be set to:\n\nReduceMotion.System - This value adjusts the animation behavior based on whether the reduced motion accessibility setting is activated on the device. When enabled, the animation is disabled; otherwise, it remains active.\nReduceMotion.Always - With this setting, the animation is consistently disabled, regardless of the device's accessibility configuration.\nReduceMotion.Never - This option ensures that the animation remains enabled at all times.\n\nBy default all animations are configured with ReduceMotion.System.\n\nReduced motion in animations�\nimport { withDelay, withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  sv1.value = withTiming(0, { reduceMotion: ReduceMotion.System });\n  sv2.value = withDelay(\n    1000,\n    withTiming(toValue, { duration }),\n    ReduceMotion.System\n  );\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nWhen reduced motion is enabled:\n\nwithSpring and withTiming return the toValue immediately\nwithDecay returns the current value immediately, taking into account the clamp parameter\nwithDelay initiates the next animation immediately\nwithRepeat\nwhen the numberOfReps is infinite or even and the animation is reversed, then the repeated animation does not start\notherwise, the repeated animation runs once\nwithSequence exclusively starts animations that have reduced motion disabled\n\nHigher-order animations pass the configuration to their children, only if the children have not been configured by the user.\n\nFor example, this animation will instantaneously reach the toValue:\n\nimport { withDelay, withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  sv.value = withDelay(\n    1000,\n    withTiming(toValue, { duration }),\n    ReduceMotion.Always\n  );\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nThis animation will execute as usual even if reduced motion is enabled on the device:\n\nimport { withDelay, withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  sv.value = withDelay(\n    1000,\n    withTiming(toValue, { duration }),\n    ReduceMotion.Never\n  );\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nAnd here withTiming will be executed as usual and with no delay:\n\nimport { withDelay, withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  sv.value = withDelay(\n    1000,\n    withTiming(toValue, { duration, reduceMotion: ReduceMotion.Never }),\n    ReduceMotion.Always\n  );\n  // ...\n}\n\nReduced motion in Layout Animations�\nimport { BounceIn } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const entering = BounceIn.reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.System);\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nWhen reduced motion is enabled:\n\nentering, keyframe, and layout animations instantaneously reach their endpoints.\nexiting animations and shared transitions are omitted.\nuseReducedMotion�\n\nThis hook returns a boolean indicating whether the reduced motion setting was enabled when the app started.

Here are some of examples of what not to do:\n\n❌ Do not disable New Architecture if it's already enabled�\n\nStarting from React Native 0.76, New Architecture is enabled by default. Disabling it manually by changing newArchEnabled=... in gradle.properties does not fix the problem, it just postpones it as the Legacy Architecture is no longer available to use in React Native 0.82 and newer versions.\n\n❌ Do not downgrade Android Gradle Plugin�\n\nIt is not recommended to change the version of Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) by modifying distributionUrl=... in gradle.properties. You should use the version of AGP used in the official app template. Changing the AGP version will lead to other problems, including version conflicts and unsupported features.\n\n❌ Do not downgrade Reanimated or any other dependency�\n\nDowngrading the dependencies increases the technical debt of your project. Newer version of Reanimated contain various bug fixes and are more stable than previous releases. You should always try to use the latest supported version of Reanimated in your app. In fact, you should try upgrading all the dependencies to the latest available rather than downgrading them.\n\n❌ Do not post another \"same issue\" comment�\n\nBefore you report an error, search for similar issues on GitHub, Stack Overflow, Google, etc. Instead posting another \"same issue\" comment which will be marked as spam, just add a reaction under the original issue. This way we know how many developers are affected which lets us prioritize our work.\n\nWhat should you do then?�\n✅ Make sure your environment is set up correctly�\n\nFirst all, make sure that you have followed all instructions in Set Up Your Environment. Run npx react-native doctor to see if there are any problems. Make sure to open a new terminal, restart Visual Studio Code or your IDE, or even reboot your computer if changes have been applied.\n\n✅ Use appropriate version of Reanimated�\n\nMake sure to use latest supported version of Reanimated, depending on the setup of your app.\n\nIf your app uses Expo SDK, you must use a specific major and minor version of Reanimated (first and second number). For instance, Expo SDK 54 supports only Reanimated 4.1.x. Make sure to update to the latest available patch version (third number), for instance 4.1.5.\n\nExpo SDK version\treact-native-reanimated version\treact-native-worklets version\n54\t~4.1.1\t0.5.1\n53\t~3.17.4\tdon't install\n52\t~3.16.1\tdon't install\n51\t~3.10.1\tdon't install\n50\t~3.6.2\tdon't install\nTIP\n\nHow to determine which version is compatible? Open https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/sdk-54/packages/expo/bundledNativeModules.json file, jump to sdk-XX branch and search for \"react-native-reanimated\".\n\nIf your project uses Expo prebuild or React Native without a framework (e.g. React Native Community CLI), you should use a version of Reanimated that is compatible with the version of React Native according to the Compatibility table.\n\nFor instance, Reanimated 4.0.x works only with React Native 0.78, 0.79, 0.80 or 0.81 and is not compatible with React Native 0.82. If you want to use Reanimated with React Native 0.82, you need to upgrade to at least 4.1.0. It is recommended to use the latest available version (in this case, 4.1.3).\n\n✅ Use appropriate version of CMake�\n\nCMake is a build system used to compile the C++ part of Reanimated on your machine. Make sure to use CMake 3.22.1 or newer. CMake version can be customized with CMAKE_VERSION environmental variable, e.g. using set CMAKE_VERSION=3.31.1. If not set, CMake 3.22.1 is used.\n\nTIP\n\nCMake will be installed automatically during app build. You can install a specific version of CMake directly from Android Studio (Tools → SDK Manager → SDK Tools → CMake).\n\n✅ Use appropriate version of Ninja�\n\nNinja is a build system used to compile the C++ part of Reanimated on your machine. Make sure to use Ninja 1.12.0 or newer (current latest is 1.12.1) as some older versions of Ninja do not handle long paths correctly (see this issue on GitHub).\n\nTIP\n\nSee this comment on GitHub for instructions on how to use a different version of Ninja.\n\n✅ Use appropriate version of Android NDK�\n\nAndroid NDK (Native Development Kit) is a set of tools used for building the native part of the app. You should use the same version of NDK as used in the official app template.\n\nTIP\n\nAndroid NDK should be installed automatically during app build. You can install a specific version of Android NDK directly from Android Studio (Tools → SDK Manager → SDK Tools → \"NDK (Side by side)\").\n\n✅ Make sure _JAVA_OPTIONS environmental variable is not set�\n\nSome developers stated that unsetting _JAVA_OPTIONS environmental variable fixes the errors and makes the build pass.\n\n✅ Enable long paths support in Windows registry�\n\nSee this page for instructions on how to enable support for long paths on Windows.\n\n✅ Make sure that project path doesn't contain any whitespace�\n\nThe build process may not work properly for paths with space characters. Spaces often appear in usernames, for example C:\\Users\\Szczepan Czekan, or project names, for instance D:\\Mobile Apps\\My Awesome Project. In such case, move the project to another directory that does not contain whitespace.\n\n✅ Make sure that project path is not too long�\n\nThe build process may not work properly for paths that are too long. Actually, CMake will raise a warning when it comes across a path longer than 240 characters. In such case, move the project or clone the repository again to a location with shorter path, for example D:\\AwesomeProject.\n\nTIP\n\nOn Windows, you can mount a specific directory (e.g. C:\\Users\\Tomek\\AwesomeProject) as a drive (e.g. H:) using the following command: subst H: C:\\Users\\Tomek\\AwesomeProject\n\n✅ Remove or invalidate caches�\n\nDuring app build, multiple compilation artifacts are saved in various paths, for instance:\n\nandroid\\build\nandroid\\.cxx\nandroid\\.gradle\nandroid\\app\\build\nandroid\\app\\.cxx\nnode_modules\\react-native-reanimated\\android\\build\nnode_modules\\react-native-reanimated\\android\\.cxx\nC:\\Users\\Tomek\\.gradle\\caches\n\nMake sure to remove these directories and their contents before trying to build the app again.\n\nIt is also recommended to invalidate Android Studio caches (File → Invalidate Caches… → Select all checkboxes → Invalidate and Restart).\n\nTIP\n\nYou can remove all untracked files in your repository using git clean -fdX command. Note that this command will remove all untracked files including hidden files like .env so please be extra careful and proceed with caution when doing so. You will also need to reinstall node_modules afterwards using your chosen package manager and rebuild the app.\n\n⚠️ I have followed all of the above steps and it still doesn't work�\n\nIf you still have problems with building for Android device on a Windows machine, please submit an issue in our repository. Make sure to provide full build logs and preferably a minimal viable reproducible example so we can replicate and investigate your issue.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nAccessibility\nNEXT\nCompatibility\nWhat should you definitely not do?\n❌ Do not disable New Architecture if it's already enabled\n❌ Do not downgrade Android Gradle Plugin\n❌ Do not downgrade Reanimated or any other dependency\n❌ Do not post another \"same issue\" comment\nWhat should you do then?\n✅ Make sure your environment is set up correctly\n✅ Use appropriate version of Reanimated\n✅ Use appropriate version of CMake\n✅ Use appropriate version of Ninja\n✅ Use appropriate version of Android NDK\n✅ Make sure _JAVA_OPTIONS environmental variable is not set\n✅ Enable long paths support in Windows registry\n✅ Make sure that project path doesn't contain any whitespace\n✅ Make sure that project path is not too long\n✅ Remove or invalidate caches\n⚠️ I have followed all of the above steps and it still doesn't work\n\nSet breakpoints and debug React Native apps with ease.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

This article summarizes all the available methods and highlights their caveats.\n\nINFO\n\nReanimated v1 works with all the common React Native debugging tools. This article focuses on the use of these tools with Reanimated v2.\n\nReact Native debugging tools�\n\nThese are the debugging tools we checked for compatibility with React Native apps using the Reanimated library:\n\nChrome debugger (also known as the React Native Debugger) is a simple tool that creates a web worker inside your preferred browser which executes your app's JavaScript code. It works with all the runtimes available in React Native.\n\nChrome DevTools (unavailable for JSC) is Chrome's built-in feature that allows for connecting to a remote JavaScript runtime. This means that the code you are debugging actually runs on the device itself and behaves the same way as it would with DevTools detached.\n\nFlipper (Hermes debugger) is an app created by Facebook that makes it easy to use the Chrome DevTools while providing additional tools for UI inspection and debugging.\n\nSafari DevTools is Safari's built-in feature that is only available for iOS devices running JSC. It works very similarly to Chrome DevTools - it allows you to connect to a remote runtime and keep code execution on device.\n\nReact Developer Tools are a standalone app that allows debugging UI through the inspector, as well as monitoring performance and profiling your app.\n\nThe JS context vs. the UI context�\n\nIt is important to understand the differences between the JS and UI contexts. One thing to note is that adding Reanimated changes nothing when it comes to debugging the regular JS context that is available in all React Native apps. It is only debugging the UI context, which is specific to the Reanimated library that might be difficult to debug in some scenarios, which are all explained in this article.\n\nDebugging web apps�\n\nFor debugging web apps, you may use the tools you prefer or any that are provided by the browser of your choice. We did not discover any issues with debugging apps using Reanimated on web.\n\nSummary�\nTool\tPlatform\tJSC\tHermes\tV8\nChrome debugger\tAndroid\t⚛️ ✅ ¹\t⚛️ ✅ ¹\t⚛️ ✅ ¹\niOS\t⚛️ ✅ ¹\t⚛️ ✅ ¹\tN/A\nChrome DevTools\tAndroid\tN/A\t⚛️ ✅ ²\t⚛️\niOS\tN/A\t⚛️ ✅ ²\tN/A\nFlipper (Hermes debugger)\tAndroid\tN/A\t⚛️ ✅ ²\t⚛️\niOS\tN/A\t⚛️ ✅ ²\tN/A\nSafari DevTools\tAndroid\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\niOS\t⚛️ ✅\tN/A\tN/A\nReact Developer Tools\tAndroid\t⚛️\t⚛️\t⚛️\niOS\t⚛️\t⚛️\tN/A\n¹ - Works, but uses web implementations of functions and runs worklets on the JS thread. This means that measure and Layout Animations will not be available.\n² - Experimental feature (see description).\nLegend:\n⚛️ ✅ - special features for React Native apps using Reanimated\n⚛️ - works the same as with all React Native apps, debugging worklets is not available\nN/A - unavailable in React Native apps\nCAUTION\n\nRemember that console logs will always appear in the primary JS runtime as the console.log function on the UI runtime is just a wrapper around the one from the JS runtime.\n\nChrome Debugger�\nPlatform\tJSC\tHermes\tV8\nAndroid\t⚛️ ✅\t⚛️ ✅\t⚛️ ✅\niOS\t⚛️ ✅\t⚛️ ✅\tN/A\n\nSummary: Works, but uses web implementations of functions and runs everything on the JS thread.\n\nSince the Chrome Debugger runs its own web worker, all the code is run on the JS thread, and it uses the JavaScript engine provided by your web browser (V8 in Chrome, JSC in Safari and SpiderMonkey in Firefox). This means that this piece of code:\n\nfunction runWorklet() {\n  'worklet';\n  console.log('worklet:', _WORKLET);\n}\nrunOnUI(runWorklet)();\n\n\nwould output:\n\nLOG: worklet: false\n\n\nAnother side effect is that Reanimated uses web implementations of all functions. This means that the scrollTo function will work (using the native web implementation), but the measure function will not be available, and its usage will trigger this error:\n\n[Reanimated] measure() cannot be used with Chrome Debugger.\n\n\nYou may still use the standard web version of measure as described here.\n\nThose functions that are provided by Reanimated and do not have web implementations won't work at all. An example of this behavior is the useAnimatedSensor hook, which currently only works on mobile platforms. When debugging in Chrome and using this hook, the following message will appear in the logs:\n\n[Reanimated] useAnimatedSensor is not available on web yet.\n\n\nBut despite all of this, it is still possible to set breakpoints both in normal JS code and in worklets (since they run on the main JS thread now).\n\nChrome DevTools�\nPlatform\tJSC\tHermes\tV8\nAndroid\tN/A\t⚛️ ✅\t⚛️\niOS\tN/A\t⚛️ ✅\tN/A\n\nSummary: Works and both contexts can be debugged.\n\nWARNING\n\nThis is an early experimental feature.\n\nWorklet debugging is now available in Reanimated apps as an early experimental feature. We do not recommend using Chrome DevTools to debug the UI context, but instead try using the Flipper tool. It has fewer bugs and provides a much better experience.\n\nIf you still want to use Chrome DevTools then follow these steps:\n\nAdd the patch-package to your project and set it up to run as a post-install task. More details can be found here.\n\nAdd the necessary patch for metro-inspector-proxy to the patches/ folder:\n\n0.76.7 → here\n0.76.5 → here\n0.76.4 → here\n0.76.0 → here\n0.73.7 → here\n0.73.5 → here\n0.72.3 → here\n0.72.1 → here\n\nWarnings about mismatched patch versions can be safely ignored if the patch was successfully applied.\n\nOpen chrome://inspect in a Google Chrome browser.\n\nSelect the Reanimated runtime from the list. The list should look something like this:\n\nYou may choose either Reanimated Runtime or Reanimated Runtime experimental (Improved Chrome Reloads), but we recommend the latter.\n\nDebugging relies on source maps that are generated by the Worklets Babel plugin, so you might have to run yarn start --reset-cache for those changes to take effect. In case it still doesn't work after that please reinstall the app and reset metro cache once again.\n\nCAUTION\n\nKnown issues include:\n\nReloads don't work - if a debugger is connected to the Reanimated runtime while the reload is performed, the app will crash (both on Android and iOS)\n\nOn iOS, a breakpoint can't be set in a line where a breakpoint was previously set and then removed\n\nOn iOS, breakpoint labels are not visible\n\nThe profiler does not work (it is not possible to stop the recording) - this is an issue with Hermes and is not related to Reanimated and has been already fixed in this PR\n\nThe console is unresponsive if there are no animations running (this will be fixed in the near future)\n\nThese issues do not affect release builds as well as debug builds where the debugger connection is closed while performing a reload or the debugger is not used at all.\n\nWe are actively working on improving the debugging experience with Chrome DevTools on Hermes.\n\nFlipper (Hermes debugger)�\nPlatform\tJSC\tHermes\tV8\nAndroid\tN/A\t⚛️ ✅\t⚛️\niOS\tN/A\t⚛️ ✅\tN/A\n\nSummary: Works and both contexts can be debugged.\n\nWARNING\n\nThis is an early experimental feature.\n\nWorklet debugging is now available in Reanimated apps as an early experimental feature. If you want to try it out follow these steps:\n\nAdd the patch-package to your project and set it up to run as a post-install task.

This is a known Flipper issue (link) and is not related to Reanimated.\n\nThe profiler does not work (it is not possible to stop the recording) - this is an issue with Hermes and is not related to Reanimated and has been already fixed in this PR\n\nThe console is unresponsive if there are no animations running (this will be fixed in the near future)\n\nThese issues do not affect release builds as well as debug builds where the debugger connection is closed while performing a reload or the debugger is not used at all.\n\nWe are actively working on improving the debugging experience with Flipper on Hermes.\n\nSafari DevTools�\nPlatform\tJSC\tHermes\tV8\nAndroid\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\niOS\t⚛️ ✅\tN/A\tN/A\n\nSummary: Safari DevTools is only available on iOS devices running the JSC engine.

All console.log outputs will appear in the console of this context. You can also set breakpoints here, but unfortunately the only source file visible is the transformed indexjs.bundle which does make things more difficult to find.\n\nThe other option will be the UI context.

Feature flags serve as a tool for incremental rollout of new implementation without affecting the general stability of the library, allowing to gather feedback from early adopters. There are two types of feature flags: static and dynamic.\n\nINFO\n\nFeature flags are available since Reanimated 4.\n\nSummary of available feature flags�\nFeature flag name\tType\tAdded in\tRemoved in\tDefault value\nDISABLE_COMMIT_PAUSING_MECHANISM\tstatic\t4.0.0\t–\tfalse\nANDROID_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS\tstatic\t4.0.0\t–\tfalse\nIOS_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS\tstatic\t4.2.0\t–\tfalse\nEXPERIMENTAL_CSS_ANIMATIONS_FOR_SVG_COMPONENTS\tstatic\t4.1.0\t–\tfalse\nUSE_SYNCHRONIZABLE_FOR_MUTABLES\tstatic\t4.1.0\t–\tfalse\nUSE_COMMIT_HOOK_ONLY_FOR_REACT_COMMITS\tstatic\t4.2.0\t–\ttrue for 4.3.0+ false otherwise\nENABLE_SHARED_ELEMENT_TRANSITIONS\tstatic\t4.2.0\t–\tfalse\nFORCE_REACT_RENDER_FOR_SETTLED_ANIMATIONS\tstatic\t4.2.0\t–\tfalse\nINFO\n\nFeature flags available in react-native-worklets are listed on this page.\n\nDescription of available feature flags�\nDISABLE_COMMIT_PAUSING_MECHANISM�\n\nWhen enabled, this feature flag is supposed to eliminate jittering of animated components like sticky header while scrolling. This feature flag is safe to enable only if preventShadowTreeCommitExhaustion feature flag from react-native (available since React Native 0.81) is also enabled – see instructions below. In all other cases it can lead to unresponsiveness of the app due to the starvation of React commits. For more details, see PR #7852.\n\nIn React Native 0.81, preventShadowTreeCommitExhaustion feature flag can be enabled by setting experimental release level. If you're using Expo, you can enable it using expo-build-properties:\n\n{\n  \"expo\": {\n    // ...\n    \"plugins\": [\n      // ...\n\n      [\n\n        \"expo-build-properties\",\n\n        {\n\n          \"android\": {\n\n            \"reactNativeReleaseLevel\": \"experimental\"\n\n          },\n\n          \"ios\": {\n\n            \"reactNativeReleaseLevel\": \"experimental\"\n\n          }\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nIt will add the following lines in gradle.properties (Android) and Info.plist (iOS):\n\nreactNativeReleaseLevel=experimental\n\n<key>ReactNativeReleaseLevel</key>\n<string>experimental</string>\n\n\nIf you're not using Expo, in order to enable experimental release level on Android, you need to add the following lines in MainApplication.kt of your app:\n\npackage com.helloworld\n\nimport android.app.Application\nimport com.facebook.react.PackageList\nimport com.facebook.react.ReactApplication\nimport com.facebook.react.ReactHost\nimport com.facebook.react.ReactNativeApplicationEntryPoint.loadReactNative\nimport com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost\nimport com.facebook.react.ReactPackage\n\nimport com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint\n\nimport com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactHost.getDefaultReactHost\nimport com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactNativeHost\n\nimport com.facebook.react.common.ReleaseLevel\n\n\nclass MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {\n  // ...\n\n  override fun onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate()\n\n    DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.releaseLevel = ReleaseLevel.EXPERIMENTAL\n\n    loadReactNative(this)\n  }\n}\n\n\nFor iOS, you need edit the following line in AppDelegate.swift of your app:\n\n@main\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n  // ...\n\n  func application(\n    _ application: UIApplication,\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil\n  ) -> Bool {\n    let delegate = ReactNativeDelegate()\n\n    let factory = RCTReactNativeFactory(delegate: delegate, releaseLevel: RCTReleaseLevel.Experimental)\n\n    delegate.dependencyProvider = RCTAppDependencyProvider()\n\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nANDROID_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS�\n\nWhen enabled, non-layout styles will be applied using the synchronouslyUpdateViewOnUIThread method (which doesn't involve layout recalculation) instead of than ShadowTree::commit method (which requires layout recalculation). In an artificial benchmark, it can lead to up to 4x increase of frames per second. Even though we don't expect such high speedups in the production apps, there should be a visible improvements in the smoothness of some animations. However, there are some unwanted side effects that one needs to take into account and properly compensate for:\n\nThe changes applied via synchronouslyUpdateViewOnUIThread are not respected by the touch gesture system of Fabric renderer which can lead to incorrect behavior, in particular if transforms are applied. In that case, it's advisable to use Pressable component from react-native-gesture-handler (which attaches to the underlying platform view rather than using ShadowTree to determine the component present at given point) rather than its original counterpart from react-native.\n\nThe changes are applied via synchronouslyUpdateViewOnUIThread are not synchronized with changes applied by ShadowTree::commit which may lead to minor inconsistencies of animated styles or animated components in a single animation frame.\n\nCurrently, only the following styles can be updated using the fast path: opacity, elevation, zIndex, backgroundColor (excluding PlatformColor), tintColor (excluding PlatformColor), borderColor (all sides, excluding PlatformColor), borderRadius (all sides) and transform (all transforms). All remaining styles, if present, will be updated via ShadowTree::commit.\n\nThis feature flag works only on Android and has no effect on iOS. For more details, see PR #7823.\n\nIOS_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS�\n\nWhen enabled, non-layout styles will be applied using the [RCTSurfacePresenter schedulerDidSynchronouslyUpdateViewOnUIThread:props:] method (which doesn't involve layout recalculation) instead of than ShadowTree::commit method (which requires layout recalculation). Limitations and unwanted side effects are the same as for ANDROID_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS. For more details, see PR #8367.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_CSS_ANIMATIONS_FOR_SVG_COMPONENTS�\n\nWhen enabled, CSS animations and transitions will also work for a limited set of props of several components from react-native-svg library. Currently, Circle, Ellipse, Line, Path and Rect components are supported.\n\nUSE_SYNCHRONIZABLE_FOR_MUTABLES�\n\nThis feature flag is supposed to speedup shared value reads on the RN runtime by reducing the number of calls to executeOnUIRuntimeSync. When enabled, mutables (which are the primitives behind shared values) use Synchronizable state to check if they should sync with the UI Runtime. For more details, see PR #8080.\n\nUSE_COMMIT_HOOK_ONLY_FOR_REACT_COMMITS�\n\nThis feature flag is supposed to fix performance regressions of animations while scrolling. When enabled, ReanimatedCommitHook applies latest animated styles and props only for React commits, which means the logic will be skipped for other commits, including state updates.\n\nENABLE_SHARED_ELEMENT_TRANSITIONS�\n\nWhen enabled, Shared Element Transitions are available to use, also the synchronous prop update flags are disabled. The feature is not yet production ready, and may have some limitations or bugs. For more details, see PR #7466.\n\nFORCE_REACT_RENDER_FOR_SETTLED_ANIMATIONS�\n\nThis feature flag enables a mechanism that periodically synchronizes animated style updates back to React by triggering a React render for animated components with accumulated animated styles and evicting them from the registry on the C++ side. It is supposed to improve performance by decreasing the number of ShadowNode clone operations in ReanimatedCommitHook for React commits. However, for the time being, it also alters the behavior when detaching animated styles from animated components – the animated styles won't be reverted to the original styles. This can cause unwanted side effects in your app's behavior, so please use this feature flag with caution, particularly if some parts of your app rely on detaching animated styles.\n\nStatic feature flags�\n\nStatic flags are intended to be resolved during code compilation and cannot be changed during application runtime. To enable a static feature flag, you need to:\n\nAdd the following lines to package.json of your app\n{\n  // ...\n  \"reanimated\": {\n    \"staticFeatureFlags\": {\n      \"EXAMPLE_STATIC_FLAG\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nRun pod install (iOS only)\nRebuild the native app\nWARNING\n\nStatic feature flags are not supported in environments where Reanimated is prebuilt with the default configuration of flags, like for instance in Expo Go and RNRepo.\n\nIt's not possible to modify static feature flags in Expo Go. Please consider using Expo Prebuild instead.\nIf your project uses RNRepo, you need to force building Reanimated and Worklets from source by adding react-native-reanimated and react-native-worklets to the deny list as described in RNRepo's documentation.\n\nTo read a static feature flag value in JavaScript, you can use getStaticFeatureFlag function.\n\nDynamic feature flags�\n\nDynamic flags can be modified during runtime and their values can change at any moment of app lifetime. To enable or disable a dynamic feature flag, you need to call setDynamicFeatureFlag function.\n\nimport { setDynamicFeatureFlag } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\nsetDynamicFeatureFlag('EXAMPLE_DYNAMIC_FLAG', true);\n\n\nTo read a dynamic feature flag value in JavaScript, you can use getDynamicFeatureFlag function.\n\nComparison of static and dynamic feature flags�\n\tStatic feature flags\tDynamic feature flags\nValue is known during app build\t✅\t❌\nValue may change during app lifetime\t❌\t✅\nValue change requires app rebuild\t✅\t❌\nCan be changed via public JavaScript API\t❌\t✅\nCan be changed via app's package.json\t✅\t❌\nCan be changed when using Expo Go or RNRepo\t❌\t✅\nRemarks for contributors�\nFeature flags should switch the implementation to the new experimental behavior only when enabled.\nInitially, the default value should be false, allowing users to opt-in for the experimental behavior when desired.\nWhen the experimental behavior is considered stable, the default value should be set to true, while still allowing users to opt-out if needed.\nAfter some period, the feature flag which is enabled by default should be removed from the codebase.\nBoth static and dynamic feature flags should follow upper snake case, i.e. EXAMPLE_FEATURE_FLAG.\nThe name of the feature flag should not contain the expression FEATURE_FLAG itself.\nIt is recommended to explicitly use ENABLE_ or DISABLE_ prefix for feature flags that enable or disable certain parts of the code for the sake of clarity.\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nDebugging worklets\nNEXT\nMigration from 1.x\nSummary of available feature flags\nDescription of available feature flags\nDISABLE_COMMIT_PAUSING_MECHANISM\nANDROID_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS\nIOS_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS\nEXPERIMENTAL_CSS_ANIMATIONS_FOR_SVG_COMPONENTS\nUSE_SYNCHRONIZABLE_FOR_MUTABLES\nUSE_COMMIT_HOOK_ONLY_FOR_REACT_COMMITS\nENABLE_SHARED_ELEMENT_TRANSITIONS\nFORCE_REACT_RENDER_FOR_SETTLED_ANIMATIONS\nStatic feature flags\nDynamic feature flags\nComparison of static and dynamic feature flags\nRemarks for contributors\n\nCatch runtime errors right in your editor.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

From triaging and commenting on issues, through extending the documentation, to reviewing and sending Pull Requests, all contributions are more than welcome.\n\nWays to Contribute�\n\nAnswering and handling open issues – great way to contribute without writing a single line of code is triaging the issues. We often get issues that have generic errors, occur only in very specific cases, do not have proper example or reproducible repository. One of the ways to help is by preparing and filling the details, which will help other contributors get up to speed with the issue faster.\n\nHelping with documentation – helping with documentation can be as simple as checking for spelling and grammar. If you encounter situations that can be explained better or in more details, click Edit this page at the bottom of most pages to get started with your own contribution. You can also help updating the page structures from old versions, as some of them are still ported from Reanimated v2 docs. Read more about helping with documentation.\n\nReviewing Pull Requests – reviewing Pull Requests is crucial as it may help catch corner cases or bugs that the contributor may have missed. Every review matters, as it helps us polish the quality of the library.\n\nContributing to the Code – contributions to the source code generally come in the form of Pull Requests. By contributing to the code you help us with solving issues, fixing bugs or introducing new, amazing features. If you want to start your adventure with open source it's good idea to take a look at good first issue on GitHub. Read more about contributing to code here.\n\nRepository overview�\n\nThe React Native Reanimated repository is a monorepo with the following structure:\n\n├── apps\n│   ├── common-app // shared source code of example apps\n│   ├── fabric-example // React Native app wrapper running the New Architecture for shared examples\n│   ├── macos-example // React Native for MacOS app wrapper for shared example code\n│   ├── next-example // Next.js wrapper for shared example code\n│   ├── tvos-example // React Native for TVOS app wrapper for shared examples\n│   └── web-example // React Native for Web app wrapper for shared examples\n├── packages\n│   ├── eslint-plugin-reanimated // source of eslint plugin\n│   ├── react-native-worklets // source of worklets package\n│   └── react-native-reanimated\n│       ├── android // source code of Android native implementation\n│       ├── apple // source code of iOS native implementation\n│       ├── Common // shared C++ code\n│       ├── scripts // JavaScript and bash scripts used in the CI pipeline\n│       └── src // reanimated source code\n└── docs\n    ├── docs-reanimated // documentation described further in Helping with documentation\n    └── docs-worklets // documentation for Worklets\n\nHandling open issues�\n\nUnderstanding and reproducing the problem can be a very time consuming task. A great way to help other contributors quickly get up to the speed with solving an issue is providing a detailed description and a reproducible example. GitHub already has a template for creating issues, nevertheless we still encounter ones that don't have all the necessary details, like:\n\na missing repository that we can clone to quickly see the problem,\nvery generic reproduction steps,\nan incomplete or missing description,\nunrelated or truncated stack trace.\n\nTo help, you can ask the owner for these missing details or try to provide them yourself. You can try reproducing the issue and filling the description so that other developers can work on solving it right away! 🎉\n\nHelping with documentation�\n\nOne of the many ways you can contribute to this project is by improving the documentation. We try to keep it up to date, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. It is also important to update the docs whenever you introduce changes to the API or you discover any inconsistencies in the current API or behaviour. This is one of the most straightforward ways to contribute. Some of the pages are still in old, v2 format and you can help us convert them to the Reanimated 3 structure.\n\nThe Reanimated documentation uses Docusaurus and is hosted on GitHub Pages. The easiest way to start adding your changes is by clicking Edit this page located at the bottom of most pages.\n\nEditing source locally�\n\nIf you want to contribute more complicated changes, it's a good idea to edit them locally. That way you can run the changes on your setup to make sure everything looks as expected. To get started, follow the steps below:\n\nRead How to Open a Pull Request\nClone react-native-reanimated\ncd react-native-reanimated\nyarn\ncd docs/docs-reanimated\nyarn && yarn start\n\nThis will start your local Docusaurus server running the documentation.\n\nProject structure�\n\nHere you can find the most important parts of the react-native-reanimated/docs/docs-reanimated project. Not all folders are listed for brevity.\n\n├── docs // contains folder with md/mdx files, each folder is a section in the side navigation, and each file is documentation page\n├── src\n│   ├── components // contains components used to make the pages interactive\n│   └── examples // contains examples that are later presented in the documentation\n└── static\n    ├── img // contains images used in the docs\n    └── recordings // contains video recordings of the examples\n\nDocumentation page structure�\n\nIt's important to maintain a consistent structure for the site, as this helps developers navigate easily and quickly find what they are looking for. In v3 documentation, we follow this page structure:\n\nIntroduction – short introduction what given feature does.\nReference – simplest possible usage showcase and type definitions, make sure that example code runs when someone copies it to quickly prototype.\nArguments – details about the arguments that given method accepts.\nReturns – details of returned values.\nExample – video, gif or interactive demo with source code. It is good practice to provide resources in both light and dark mode.\nRemarks – make sure to highlight everything that might not be obvious i.e. platform specific quirks, compatibility issues, additional setups required.\nPlatform compatibility – information about platforms that given feature supports.\n\nThe structure may vary depending on the given feature. If the one above doesn't seem to be a good fit for you, try to find a similar feature and see how it is documented.\n\nDocumentation writing style guide�\n\nDevelopers want to find the solutions to their problems as fast as possible. To address this, we optimize our documentation for skimming. We believe that improvements to documentation have a direct impact on the overall developer experience. This section outlines some best practices for writing technical documentation. Treat these guidelines as recommendations rather than absolute rules.\n\nIf you can spare 2 hours, we highly recommend taking a free Technical Writing One course by Google.\n\nAvoid passive voice�\n\nMost sentences in technical documentation should use active voice. Sentences in active voice are usually simpler than those in passive voice.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\nThe arguments are provided to the function.\nA worklet is generated by the babel plugin.\nUI thread is being used by Reanimated.\n\nwhich if we rewrite these sentences to active voice become simpler:\n\nThe function receives the arguments.\nThe babel plugin generates a worklet.\nReanimated runs on the UI thread.\nPrefer short, clear sentences�\n\nWhen it comes to technical documentation, simplicity is key. Prefer writing short and simple sentences.\n\nOftentimes you can split long sentences into shorter ones by repeating the sentence subject.\n\nKeep in mind that many readers aren't native English speakers.\n\nSplit paragraphs into organized lists�\n\nPeople tend to skip over long paragraphs of text. Organized lists are usually easier to read. They help developers get the information they are looking for faster.\n\nRemember to introduce the list first.\n\nThe Reanimated installation steps:\n\n- Add Reanimated package form npm\n- Add babel plugin to babel.config.js\n- Reset cache\n\nAvoid acronyms and abbreviations�\n\nAcronyms can often lead to confusion.\n\nFor example, in the context of libraries, abbreviations like REA, RNGH, RNS, may be obvious to developers proficient in the React Native open source space, but completely unknown to beginners.\n\nSome acronyms, such as RN, can mean both React Native and React Navigation.\n\nWhen explaining topics that often use domain-specific acronyms, such as JSI, JNI, JSC, you should first introduce them. For example, JavaScript Core (JSC) or JavaScript Interface (JSI).\n\nThe following rule doesn't apply to globally established abbreviations like UI, API, HTML, TS etc.\n\nUse contractions�\n\nPrefer writing using contractions like don't, doesn't, it's instead of full forms like do not, does not, it is.\n\nEmbedding interactive examples�\n\nWe try to make the code examples as easy as possible. This is why good, interactive examples are crucial. To create interactive examples in the documentation you can use InteractiveExample component. It takes src prop that expects source of a component that you can declare in src/examples, and a component prop that showcases given code.\n\nExample with a video�\nimport AnimatedKeyboardSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/AnimatedKeyboard';\n\n<InteractiveExample\n  src={AnimatedKeyboardSrc}\n  component={\n    <ThemedVideo\n      center\n      width={300}\n      sources={{\n        light: '/recordings/useAnimatedKeyboard_light.mov',\n        dark: '/recordings/useAnimatedKeyboard_dark.mov',\n      }}\n    />\n  }\n/>;\n\nExample with an interactive component�\nimport DecayTrain from '@site/src/examples/DecayTrain';\nimport DecayTrainSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/DecayTrain';\n\n<InteractiveExample\n  src={DecayTrainSrc}\n  component={<DecayTrain />}\n  label=\"Grab and drag the train\"\n/>;\n\nContributing to the Code�\n\nPosting Pull Requests to the issues is a great way to contribute to Reanimated. If you are eager to start contributing right away, we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs which have limited scope. In this section we'll describe how to play around with Reanimated setup in more detail.\n\nCAUTION\n\nMake sure that you have React Native setup properly and you are familiar with How to Open a Pull Request before reading this section further.\n\nWe have shared code of example app, that is run on different platforms and architectures. When working on an issue the most important destinations will be:\n\napps/common-app – shared source code with example app\npackages/react-native-reanimated/src/reanimated2 – containing source code related to JS part of Reanimated features\npackages/react-native-reanimated/android/src/main/java/com/swmansion/reanimated – containing source code related to Android native part of Reanimated features\npackages/react-native-reanimated/apple – containing source code related to iOS native part of Reanimated features\n\nWe use two separate example apps depending on the feature or a bug we're currently working on. If the code relates to CSS Animations then we start from editing\n\napps/common-app/src/apps/css/examples/animations/screens/testExamples/Playground.tsx\n\n\nFor other features like worklet API and Layout Animations we would usually start from editing\n\napps/common-app/src/apps/reanimated/examples/EmptyExample.tsx\n\n\nThis is the part that we often attach to PR so other developers can test the same use-case (remember not to commit your changes from Playground/EmptyExample file!). Next, we run the apps/fabric-example app and start development.\n\nINFO\n\nIf you want to implement a new feature or fix a bug, but still are unsure after reading through this section or could use some guidance, you can reach out to the Reanimated Team on Discord.\n\nWorking with Android�\n\nTo start with, let's install all dependencies:\n\nyarn && yarn build-all\ncd apps/fabric-example\nyarn start – make sure to start metro bundler before building the app in Android Studio.\n\nand open react-native-reanimated/apps/fabric-example/android with Android Studio.\n\nThe native source code of Reanimated can be found in react-native-reanimated module, in /packages/react-native-reanimated/android/src/main/java/com/swmansion/reanimated. Make sure the Metro bundler is running. You can now build React Native app or debug native code.\n\nWorking with iOS�\n\nTo begin with, let's install all the necessary dependencies:\n\nyarn && yarn build-all\n(cd apps/fabric-example/ios && bundle install && bundle exec pod install) – install Pods for iOS\ncd apps/fabric-example && yarn start – make sure to start metro bundler before building the app in Xcode.\n\nand open react-native-reanimated/apps/fabric-example/ios/ReanimatedExample.xcworkspace with Xcode.\n\nTo find the native source code of Reanimated navigate to Pods > Development Pods > RNReanimated > Example > ... > ... > node_modules > react-native-reanimated > apple. Make sure the Metro bundler is running. You can now build React Native app or debug native code.\n\nPreparing a Pull Request�\n\nWhen the code changes are ready, it's time to open a Pull Request. We configured the repository to come with a template to help you post your changes properly. The most important of these are:\n\nSummary:\nIf you're solving a specific issue, start by linking it, for example: Fixes #2137 (here goes a full link to an issue and GitHub shortens it into a #number format).\nWrite what are your motivations and how you solved the problem.\nIf applicable, it's a good idea to include a screenshot or a video of before and after making changes.\nTest plan – Describe how others can test your changes, here we usually attach the code from your modified EmptyExample, that you used for testing.\nTesting changes in your project�\n\nIf you want to test changes in your own project, the best way is to create a patch using git diff or by pointing to a specific commit in package.json.\n\nSee you on GitHub! 🎉\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nCompatibility\nNEXT\nDebugging worklets\nWays to Contribute\nRepository overview\nHandling open issues\nHelping with documentation\nEditing source locally\nProject structure\nDocumentation page structure\nDocumentation writing style guide\nEmbedding interactive examples\nContributing to the Code\nWorking with Android\nWorking with iOS\nPreparing a Pull Request\nTesting changes in your project\n\nSet breakpoints and debug React Native apps with ease.\n\nTry Radon IDE for free\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

When installing Reanimated 2, you will be able to use the old API as well as the new one. We made the latest stable Reanimated 1 available from the same package with a few exceptions, as we needed to address some naming collisions. Whenever there was a naming collision with Reanimated 1, we'd rename the Reanimated 1 version of such method in order to keep the naming in Reanimated 2 cleaner. This strategy made the most sense to us, as we are planning to slowly phase out the old API (we will keep making fixes to Reanimated 1 core but most likely stop new feature development). Unfortunately, it means that Reanimated 2 introduces some breaking changes to the API, where some methods pulled from Reanimated 1 changed their name. Thankfully the list of the renamed methods is relatively short, and the renamed methods weren't too frequently used anyways.\n\nRenamed methods:�\n1. interpolate renamed to interpolateNode�\n\nWhen using interpolate imported directly from react-native-reanimated v1, in v2 you should use interpolateNode instead. If you were using a class member method AnimatedValue.interpolate, no change is necessary.\n\n2.

All the animation logic you've written in Reanimated v2 or v3 API works in 4.x with little to no changes. Animations based on shared values will work the same way as before, simultaneously and interchangeably with CSS animations and transitions. This means you can adopt CSS animations and transitions in your codebase incrementally at your own pace.\n\nNew Architecture only�\n\nReanimated 4.x supports only the New Architecture and drops support for the Legacy Architecture along with the legacy renderer (commonly known as Paper) entirely. If your app still runs on the Legacy Architecture, please consider adopting the New Architecture or stay with latest 3.x release.\n\nAdded dependency on react-native-worklets�\n\nIn Reanimated 4, worklets implementation has been moved to a separate library named react-native-worklets. You need to install react-native-worklets package using your package manager and rebuild the native apps. Make sure to install compatible version of react-native-worklets as specified in the compatibility table.\n\nYou can read more about react-native-worklets library in its documentation.\n\nRenamed react-native-reanimated/plugin�\n\nChange 'react-native-reanimated/plugin' to 'react-native-worklets/plugin' in babel.config.js.\n\nWorklet-specific functions should be imported from react-native-worklets�\n\nReanimated 4 moves all worklet-related functions to react-native-worklets library. While they are re-exported from react-native-reanimated for backwards compatibility, they are marked as deprecated and planned to be removed in a future release of Reanimated. You can update your imports as described below to make sure you're not using deprecated APIs.\n\nexecuteOnUIRuntimeSync�\n\nReplaced with runOnUISync. The API changed slightly so that the arguments are no longer passed as a separate function invocation.\n\n- import { executeOnUIRuntimeSync } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n- executeOnUIRuntimeSync((greeting) => console.log(greeting))(\"Hello from UI Runtime synchronously\");\n+ import { runOnUISync } from 'react-native-worklets';\n+ runOnUISync((greeting) => console.log(greeting), \"Hello from UI Runtime synchronously\");\n\nrunOnJS�\n\nReplaced with scheduleOnRN. The API changed slightly so that the arguments are no longer passed as a separate function invocation.\n\n- import { runOnJS } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n- runOnJS((greeting) => console.log(greeting))(\"Hello from RN Runtime\");\n+ import { scheduleOnRN } from 'react-native-worklets';\n+ scheduleOnRN((greeting) => console.log(greeting), \"Hello from RN Runtime\");\n\nrunOnUI�\n\nReplaced with scheduleOnUI. The API changed slightly so that the arguments are no longer passed as a separate function invocation.\n\n- import { runOnUI } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n- runOnUI((greeting) => console.log(greeting))(\"Hello from UI Runtime asynchronously\");\n+ import { scheduleOnUI } from 'react-native-worklets';\n+ scheduleOnUI((greeting) => console.log(greeting), \"Hello from UI Runtime asynchronously\");\n\nrunOnRuntime�\n\nReplaced with scheduleOnRuntime. The API changed slightly so that the arguments are no longer passed as a separate function invocation.\n\n- import { runOnRuntime } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n- runOnRuntime(runtime, (greeting) => console.log(greeting))(\"Hello from custom Runtime\");\n+ import { scheduleOnRuntime } from 'react-native-worklets';\n+ scheduleOnRuntime(runtime, (greeting) => console.log(greeting), \"Hello from custom Runtime\");\n\nMoved without changes to the API�\nmakeShareableCloneRecursive - replaced with createSerializable.\ncreateWorkletRuntime - moved without changes.\nWorkletRuntime - moved without changes.\nisWorkletFunction - moved without changes.\nChanged the default behavior of withSpring�\n\nwithSpring animation no longer uses restDisplacementThreshold and restSpeedThreshold parameters, they were replaced with a single energyThreshold parameter.\n\nThis parameter is relative to the animation, unlike absolute restDisplacementThreshold and restSpeedThreshold. This means that removing all usage of restDisplacementThreshold and restSpeedThreshold should be enough and you don't need to override energyThreshold in your codebase.\n\nduration parameter was changed that so it's now the perceptual duration of the animation, not the actual time it takes to complete. The actual time to complete is 1.5 times the perceptual duration. If you were using the duration parameter and want to achieve the same effect as before, you need to divide the duration parameter by 1.5 in your codebase.\n\nThe default parameters of the animation changed as well. They proved to be of little use in real-world applications. If you depended on them, you can still import them with the following import statement:\n\nimport { Reanimated3DefaultSpringConfig } from 'react-native-reanimated'; // For physics based defaults.\nimport { Reanimated3DefaultSpringConfigWithDuration } from 'react-native-reanimated'; // For duration based defaults.\n\n\nYou can explore the changes in the default parameters in withSpring reference.\n\nRemoved useWorkletCallback�\n\nuseWorkletCallback was marked as deprecated in Reanimated 3 and has been removed in Reanimated 4.\n\nTo migrate from useWorkletCallback:\n\nAdd 'worklet'; directive inside the function\nAdd dependency array according to the rules of hooks\nuseCallback(() => {\n\n  'worklet';\n\n  // some code\n\n}, [...dependencies]);\n\n\nIf you're using gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet, you need to upgrade to version 5.1.8 or newer.\n\nRemoved addWhitelistedNativeProps and addWhitelistedUIProps�\n\nReanimated 4 removes the concept of native and UI props. addWhitelistedNativeProps and addWhitelistedUIProps are now no-ops, marked as deprecated and planned to be removed in a future release of Reanimated. You are safe to remove all usages of these functions across your codebase.\n\nRemoved combineTransition�\n\ncombineTransition was deprecated in Reanimated 3 and has been removed in Reanimated 4. You can achieve the same effect using the syntax below. For more details, check out Entry/Exit Transition.\n\nEntryExitTransition.entering(entering).exiting(exiting);\n\nRemoved support for react-native-v8�\n\nReanimated 4 removes support for react-native-v8 engine. We no longer actively support V8 and the project itself seems to be abandoned as there hasn't been any new commits since August 2024.\n\nIf you are affected by this change, please leave a comment under the related PR and explain your motivation to use V8 engine with Reanimated. We might consider restoring support for V8 engine at some point in the future.\n\nRenamed useScrollViewOffset to useScrollOffset�\n\nIn Reanimated 4, we renamed useScrollViewOffset to useScrollOffset. For the sake of backwards compatibility, we decided to keep useScrollViewOffset for now but it is marked as deprecated and planned to be removed in a future release of Reanimated. You need to update all useScrollViewOffset usages to useScrollOffset.\n\nRemoved useAnimatedGestureHandler�\n\nuseAnimatedGestureHandler was marked as deprecated in Reanimated 3 and has been removed in Reanimated 4. You need to refactor all its usages to the new Gesture API introduced in Gesture Handler 2 according to the steps described in React Native Gesture Handler documentation.\n\nIntegration with other libraries�\n\nAll integrations with other third-party libraries such as React Native Gesture Handler or React Native Skia work the same as on 3.x. However, Reanimated 4 no longer provides support for React Native V8.\n\nMigrating from 2.x�\n\nFor the migration guide between 2.x and 3.x versions please consult Migration from 2.x to 3.x.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nMigration from 2.x\nNEXT\nPerformance\nBreaking changes\nNew Architecture only\nAdded dependency on react-native-worklets\nRenamed react-native-reanimated/plugin\nWorklet-specific functions should be imported from react-native-worklets\nChanged the default behavior of withSpring\nRemoved useWorkletCallback\nRemoved addWhitelistedNativeProps and addWhitelistedUIProps\nRemoved combineTransition\nRemoved support for react-native-v8\nRenamed useScrollViewOffset to useScrollOffset\nRemoved useAnimatedGestureHandler\nIntegration with other libraries\nMigrating from 2.x\n\nCatch runtime errors right in your editor.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

This can also happen after upgrading to Expo SDK 53 (or newer) where the New Architecture is enabled by default.\n\nWe are actively working with the React core team at Meta on identifying bottlenecks and improving the overall state of animations on the New Architecture. For now, please consider enabling the following optimizations in your app to mitigate the performance regressions.\n\nPlease note that downgrading your Expo SDK version or using an older release of Reanimated is not a good solution in the long term. Reanimated 3 is no longer maintained and will not receive updates to support upcoming releases of React Native. Please upgrade to the latest version of Reanimated 4 in order to get bug fixes and other improvements.\n\n⚠️ Flickering/jittering while scrolling�\n\nProblem: When scrolling a FlatList or ScrollView, you might notice flickering or jittering of animated components (e.g. sticky header) implemented using useAnimatedScrollHandler hook.\n\nSolution: You need to upgrade to React Native 0.81 (or newer), set experimental release level in order to enable preventShadowTreeCommitExhaustion feature flag and enable DISABLE_COMMIT_PAUSING_MECHANISM static feature flag as described here.\n\n⚠️ Lower FPS while scrolling�\n\nProblem: FPS drops when there are many animated components on the screen during scrolling.\n\nSolution: You need to upgrade to React Native 0.80 (or newer), upgrade to Reanimated 4.2.0 (or newer) and enable USE_COMMIT_HOOK_ONLY_FOR_REACT_COMMITS static feature flag as described here.\n\nYou can also consider enabling enableCppPropsIteratorSetter feature flag as described below.\n\n⚠️ Low FPS when running multiple animations at once�\n\nProblem: When animating many components simultaneously (also across multiple screens) you might notice FPS regressions.\n\nSolution 1: Enable ANDROID_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS (available from 4.0.0) and IOS_SYNCHRONOUSLY_UPDATE_UI_PROPS (available from 4.2.0) static feature flags as described here for Android and here for iOS, respectively. This will enable a fast code path for applying updates of non-layout styles like opacity or transform via platform-specific mechanisms rather than cloning ShadowNode instances and calling ShadowTree::commit method.\n\nNote that these flags affect the touch detection system for components with animated transforms so you might want to consider using Pressable from react-native-gesture-handler instead of the built-in one from react-native.\n\nIt is also recommended to animate non-layout styles (e.g. transform) rather than layout-affecting styles as described below.\n\nSolution 2: Manually enable enableCppPropsIteratorSetter feature flag from react-native by patching the source files and building React Native from source. Note that this feature flag is experimental and may produce unexpected results.\n\n⚠️ Blink of incorrect layout of FlashList�\n\nProblem: When FlashList component from @shopify/flash-list is mounted while there are some animations running, the item components might be positioned incorrectly for a split second. Unfortunately, the root cause of the issue is located in React Native itself. We reported a GitHub issue where you can track the progress.\n\nℹ️ Debug vs. release mode�\n\nIt is very likely that the performance regressions are noticeable only in the development build of your app. In the release mode, both Reanimated and React Native itself are built with compiler optimizations enabled, which results in much better performance when compared to the debug mode.\n\n💡 Use debugOptimized build variant on Android�\n\nFor better development experience, you might also consider using debugOptimized build variant on Android (available from React Native 0.82) – more details here.\n\nWhat to avoid�\n❌ Avoid reading shared values on the JS thread�\n\nReading shared values is allowed only from worklets running on the UI thread. You should avoid reading shared values in the React Native runtime on the JavaScript thread.\n\nconst sv = useSharedValue(0);\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  console.log(sv.value); // ❌ reading shared value in the RN runtime (not recommended)\n}, []);\n\nconst animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n  return { opacity: sv.value }; // ✅ this is okay\n});\n\n\nWhen you read the sv.value in the React Native runtime, the JS thread will get blocked until the value is fetched from the UI thread. In most cases it will be negligible, but if the UI thread is busy or you are reading a value multiple times, the wait time needed to synchronize both threads may significantly increase. For more details, check out this article.\n\n❌ Avoid animating too many components at once�\n\nReanimated is perfectly capable of animating several dozens of components at once. However, if there's too many components to be animated simultaneously, performance can be affected. As a rule of thumb, you should animate no more than 100 components for low-end Android devices and no more than 500 components for iOS. For more complex animations, consider using Reanimated with react-native-skia instead of rendering individual React components.\n\nOther tips�\n💡 Enable 120 fps�\n\nIn order to enable support for 120 fps on iOS, make sure that CADisableMinimumFrameDurationOnPhone flag is enabled in Info.plist. The flag is enabled by default in the app template starting from React Native 0.82.\n\n<key>CADisableMinimumFrameDurationOnPhone</key>\n<true/>\n\n💡 Prefer animating non-layout properties�\n\nAnimating non-layout properties (like transform, opacity or backgroundColor) is generally more performant than animating styles that affect layout (like top/left, width/height, margin or padding). That's because the latter group requires an additional step of layout recalculation on each animation frame.\n\nWhenever possible, you should prefer using non-layout styles (e.g. transform with translateX/translateY) rather than their layout-affecting counterparts (i.e. top/left).\n\nAdditionally, non-layout properties can be updated using a fast path – more details here.\n\n💡 Memoize frame callbacks�\n\nIf you are using useFrameCallback, you should wrap the frame callback worklet inside useCallback in order to memoize it. This way, the frame callback won't need to be recrated and thus registered on every render. If you are using React Compiler, the frame callback should be memoized automatically.\n\nuseFrameCallback(\n  useCallback(() => {\n    'worklet';\n  }, [...deps])\n);\n\n💡 Memoize gesture objects�\n\nIf you are using React Native Gesture Handler, you should wrap gesture objects like Gesture.Tap() or similar inside useMemo in order to memoize them. This way, the gestures won't need to be reattached on every render. This is particularly important for FlatList items where performance is key. If you are using React Compiler, the gesture objects should be memoized automatically.\n\nconst pan = useMemo(\n  () =>\n    Gesture.Pan()\n      .onStart(() => {})\n      .onEnd(() => {}),\n  [...deps]\n);\n\n💡 Animate TextInput instead of re-rendering Text component�\n\nWhen implementing an animated number counter, don't use React state to periodically update the counter. Instead, store the number in a shared value and use an animated TextInput component to display the current value. For more details, see this example.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nMigration from 3.x\nNEXT\nSupported style properties\nPerformance regressions on the New Architecture\n⚠️ Flickering/jittering while scrolling\n⚠️ Lower FPS while scrolling\n⚠️ Low FPS when running multiple animations at once\n⚠️ Blink of incorrect layout of FlashList\nℹ️ Debug vs. release mode\nWhat to avoid\n❌ Avoid reading shared values on the JS thread\n❌ Avoid animating too many components at once\nOther tips\n💡 Enable 120 fps\n💡 Prefer animating non-layout properties\n💡 Memoize frame callbacks\n💡 Memoize gesture objects\n💡 Animate TextInput instead of re-rendering Text component\n\nStreamline your React Native & Expo development.\n\nInstall Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Inheritance�\n\nStyle inheritance is not supported. Properties that would normally inherit values (e.g., textDecorationColor inheriting from color) must be provided separately, as inheritance is not implemented.\n\nRelative Margins�\n\nYoga applies relative (%) margins in a different way than the web browser does. In React Native, the margin is added as a space between items without changing dimensions of the se items. As a result, the size of the parent container can change if the total size of its children with added margins exceeds the parent container size.\n\nOn the other hand, the web browser shrinks items in such a way that the specified relative margin is occupies the correct amount of space in the parent container.\n\nMixed-Unit Margins�\n\nInterpolation between absolute (numeric) and relative (%) margins may not work properly if dimensions of the parent component are affected by applied margins. This is a problem with our implementation and it can be seen as incorrect animation pacing (the animation can speed up/slow down when the parent size changes).\n\nMixed-Unit Border Radius�\n\nYoga calculates borders in different ways for numeric values and relative (%) values. For the first one, it applies the same radius on both edges of the container which are near the rounded corner. For the second one, it applies different radius to the shorter edge and different to the longer one, depending on the length of the container edge. Currently, there is no possibility to properly interpolate between absolute (numeric) and relative (%) values.\n\nflexBasis�\n\nEven though changes of this property are calculated properly during the animation, they aren't applied to the view. Other flex properties, such as flexGrow and flexShrink work fine, so they could be used for animations.\n\nAnimating text shadow styles�\n\nOn the web, all text shadow styles (i.e. textShadowColor, textShadowOffset, textShadowRadius) need to be specified in the animation keyframes to preserve the style during animation.\n\niOS and Android text shadow styles doesn't have this limitations and work as intended.\n\nSo, for example, if we want to have a shadow color and animate the shadow radius, we can't specify textShadowColor just in the element style but we also have to add it to every keyframe of the animation, even though only the textShadowRadius is the style we want to animate. Consider this:\n\n<Animated.Text\n  style={{\n    animationName: {\n      from: {\n        textShadowRadius: 8, // while the shadow radius correctly animates from 8 ✅\n      },\n      to: {\n        textShadowRadius: 16, // to 16 ✅\n      },\n    },\n    textShadowColor: 'red', // 🚨 the shadow color would be overridden in the animation keyframes\n    // that means the shadow would be black!\n  }}>\n  Reanimated\n</Animated.Text>\n\n\nTo mitigate this limitation, you need to specify the textShadowColor in every keyframe definition:\n\n<Animated.Text\n  style={{\n    animationName: {\n      from: {\n        textShadowColor: 'red', // shadows starts 'red'\n        textShadowRadius: 8,\n      },\n      to: {\n        textShadowColor: 'red', // and keeps being 'red' throughout the animation\n        textShadowRadius: 16,\n      },\n    },\n  }}>\n  Reanimated\n</Animated.Text>\n\n\nWhy do I need this?\n\nAnimating box shadow styles�\n\nSimilarly to the text shadow styles - all shadow styles (i.e. shadowColor, shadowOffset, shadowOpacity, shadowRadius) need to be specified in the animation keyframes to preserve the style during animation on the Web. Keep in mind that shadowOffset, shadowOpacity, shadowRadius style properties aren't implemented on Android in React Native so they also can't be animated.\n\nWe highly recommend to use the boxShadow property which doesn't have this limitation and also works on Android.\n\nAnimating image tint color�\n\nTo animate the tintColor property on iOS, you must ensure that tintColor is included in the style object when the Image component is first rendered (mounted). If tintColor is not set initially, this property won't be updated via CSS animations or transitions.\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nPerformance\nNEXT\nTesting with Jest\nRemarks\nStyle Inheritance\nRelative Margins\nMixed-Unit Margins\nMixed-Unit Border Radius\nflexBasis\nAnimating text shadow styles\nAnimating box shadow styles\nAnimating image tint color\n\nPreview React Native components in isolation.\n\nTry Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

Therefore, having any of those pieces in your code - directly or indirectly - separate from react-native-reanimated, especially having any code transpiled with a different version of the aforementioned plugin will result in undefined behavior and errors.\n\nFailed to create a worklet�\n\nProblem: This usually happens when Reanimated is not properly installed, e.g. forgetting to include the Worklets Babel plugin in babel.config.js.\n\nSolution: See installation docs at https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#react-native-community-cli for more information.\n\nNative part of Reanimated doesn't seem to be initialized�\n\nProblem: This issue happens when Reanimated fails to initialize its native side from JavaScript.\n\nSolution:\n\nIf you recently installed or upgraded Reanimated, make sure to rebuild your app.\nCheck if your platform is supported by Reanimated. Currently we support:\nAndroid\niOS\nmacOS\ntvOS\nvisionOS\nWeb\nIf you are using Reanimated in a brownfield app, make sure to initialize the native library manually.\nUsing dev bundle in a release app build is not supported�\n\nProblem: This happens when you use a release build of your app with a development JavaScript bundle.\n\nSolution: See this post for more information.\n\nCouldn't determine the version of the native part of Reanimated�\n\nProblem: This happens when Reanimated fails to determine the version of its native part.\n\nSolution: Check if you have rebuilt your app after upgrading react-native-reanimated. If you use Expo Go, you must use the exact version which is bundled into Expo SDK.\n\nMismatch between JavaScript part and native part of Reanimated�\n\nProblem: This happens when Reanimated has different versions of its JavaScript and native parts.\n\nSolution: Check if you have rebuilt your app after upgrading react-native-reanimated. If you use Expo Go, you must use the exact version which is bundled into Expo SDK.\n\nC++ side failed to resolve JavaScript code version�\n\nSee Couldn't determine the version of the native part of Reanimated.\n\nMismatch between C++ code version and JavaScript code version�\n\nSee Mismatch between JavaScript part and native part of Reanimated and Mismatch between JavaScript code version and Worklets Babel plugin version.\n\nC++ side failed to resolve Java code version�\n\nProblem: This happens when Reanimated fails to determine the version of its Java part - most likely because Java part hasn't rebuilt after an upgrade.\n\nSolution: Make sure to rebuild your app and see if the problem persists. If it does, feel free to create an issue on our GitHub.\n\nMismatch between C++ code version and Java code version�\n\nProblem: This happens when Reanimated has different versions of its C++ and Java parts.\n\nSolution: See Native side failed to resolve Java code version.\n\nJava side failed to resolve C++ code version�\n\nProblem: This happens when Reanimated fails to determine the version of its C++ part - most likely because for some reason C++ part hasn't rebuilt after an upgrade.\n\nSolution: See Native side failed to resolve Java code version.\n\nMismatch between Java code version and C++ code version�\n\nProblem: This happens when Reanimated has different versions of its Java and C++ parts.\n\nSolution: See Native side failed to resolve Java code version.\n\nMultiple versions of Reanimated were detected�\n\nProblem: This error usually happens when in your project exists more than one instance of Reanimated. It can occur when some of your dependency has installed Reanimated inside their own node_modules instead of using it as a peer dependency. In this case two different versions of Reanimated JavaScript module might try to initialize its native part. You can check which libraries are using Reanimated e.g. with yarn why react-native-reanimated or npm ls react-native-reanimated.\n\nSolution: Modify your package.json file accordingly:\n\nif you use yarn, you should add resolution property:\n\"resolutions\": {\n  \"react-native-reanimated\": <Reanimated version>\n}\n\nif you use npm, you should add overrides property:\n\"overrides\": {\n  \"react-native-reanimated\": <Reanimated version>\n}\n\n\nAfter that make sure to run your package manager again, either yarn or npm install.\n\nAnother instance of Reanimated was detected�\n\nSee Multiple versions of Reanimated were detected.\n\nOutdated version of React Native for New Architecture�\n\nProblem: Reanimated supports New Architecture (Fabric) only on the latest minor release of React Native.\n\nSolution: Please upgrade to a newer version of React Native or downgrade to an older version of Reanimated. See the compatibility table for a full list of supported versions of React Native.\n\nWarnings�\nReduced motion setting is enabled on this device.�\n\nProblem: This warning is displayed to avoid confusion that could arise when Reduced motion is enabled.\n\nSolution: Do nothing, this warning is safe to ignore as it is only displayed in development mode to avoid confusion. If you wish to disable it, you can add the following line to your project's root file:\n\nLogBox.ignoreLogs([\n  '[Reanimated] Reduced motion setting is enabled on this device.',\n]);\n\n\nSee the accessibility overview to learn more about Reduced Motion.\n\nDependency issues�\nUnable to find a specification for RNWorklets depended upon by RNReanimated�\n\nProblem: This happens when you have installed Reanimated 4 but don't have react-native-worklets installed as a dependency.\n\nPlatform: iOS\n\nSolution: Install react-native-worklets with your package manager, i.e. yarn add react-native-worklets or npm i react-native-worklets. Make sure to install a compatible version of react-native-worklets for your Reanimated version.\n\nUnable to resolve module react-native-worklets�\n\nProblem: This happens when you have installed Reanimated 4 but don't have react-native-worklets installed as a dependency.\n\nPlatform: Web\n\nSolution: Install react-native-worklets with your package manager, i.e. yarn add react-native-worklets or npm i react-native-worklets.

For that case all of the functionalities are implemented purely in JavaScript, hence the efficiency of the animations might be lower.\n\nExample app�\n\nIf you want to start the example applications from the reanimated repository you need to run the following commands inside respository root:\n\nyarn && yarn build\n\n\nThen run inside the apps/web-example directory:\n\nyarn start\n\nWebpack support�\n\nIf you want to use Reanimated in a webpack app you should adjust your webpack config.\n\nExample webpack config file with Reanimated support:\n\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: ['babel-polyfill', './index.js'],\n  plugins: [\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n      filename: 'index.html',\n      template: './index.html',\n    }),\n    new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin({ JEST_WORKER_ID: null }),\n    new webpack.DefinePlugin({ process: { env: {} } }),\n  ],\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/,\n        use: {\n          loader: 'babel-loader',\n          options: {\n            presets: [\n              '@babel/preset-react',\n              { plugins: ['@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties'] },\n            ],\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    alias: { 'react-native$': 'react-native-web' },\n    extensions: ['.web.js', '.js'],\n  },\n};\n\nWeb without the Babel plugin�\nCAUTION\n\nWe strongly recommend not opting out of the Worklets Babel plugin, as it is the only configuration we actively test.\n\nIt is possible to use Reanimated without the Worklets Babel plugin (react-native-worklets/plugin) on the Web, with some additional configuration.\n\nReanimated hooks all accept optional dependency arrays. Under the hood, Reanimated uses extra data provided by the Worklets Babel plugin to automatically infer these dependencies for you.\n\nIn order to use Reanimated without the Worklets Babel plugin, you need to explicitly pass the dependency array whenever you use a Reanimated hook.\n\nPassing a dependency array is valid on both Web and native. Adding them will not negatively impact iOS or Android.\n\nMake sure the following hooks have a dependency array as the last argument:\n\nuseDerivedValue\nuseAnimatedStyle\nuseAnimatedProps\nuseAnimatedReaction\n\nFor example:\n\nconst sv = useSharedValue(0);\nconst dv = useDerivedValue(\n  () => sv.value + 1,\n  [sv] // dependency array here\n);\n\n\nBe sure to pass the dependency itself (sv) and not sv.value to the dependency array.\n\nESLint Support�\n\nWhen you use hooks from React, they give you nice suggestions from ESLint to include all dependencies. In order to add this support to Reanimated hooks, add the following to your ESLint config:\n\n{\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\": [\n      \"error\",\n      {\n        \"additionalHooks\": \"(useAnimatedStyle|useDerivedValue|useAnimatedProps)\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nINFO\n\nThis assumes you've already installed the react-hooks eslint plugin.\n\nIf you're using ESLint autofix, the ESLint plugin may add .value to the dependency arrays, rather than the root dependency. In these cases, you should update the array yourself.\n\nconst sv = useSharedValue(0);\n\n// 🚨 bad, sv.value is in the array\nconst dv = useDerivedValue(() => sv.value, [sv.value]);\n\n// ✅ good, sv is in the array\nconst dv = useDerivedValue(() => sv.value, [sv]);\n\nSolito / Next.js Compatibility�\n\nThere is an experimental SWC plugin in the works. However, given that this may not work properly, you can use the Web without a Babel plugin instructions above.\n\nNext.js Polyfill�\n\nIn order to use Reanimated with Next.js / Solito, you'll need to add the raf polyfill for requestAnimationFrame to not throw on the server:\n\nyarn add raf\n\n\nAdd the following to the top of your _app.tsx:\n\nimport 'raf/polyfill';\n\nEdit this page\nPREVIOUS\nTroubleshooting\nNEXT\nReanimated Babel plugin\nExample app\nWebpack support\nWeb without the Babel plugin\nESLint Support\nSolito / Next.js Compatibility\nNext.js Polyfill\n\nPreview React Native components in isolation.\n\nTry Radon IDE\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

In addition, we use withTiming util which makes our animation smooth.\n\nExpand the full code\n  const regularCardAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    const spinValue = interpolate(Number(isFlipped.value), [0, 1], [0, 180]);\n    const rotateValue = withTiming(`${spinValue}deg`, { duration });\n\n\nThe FlipCard component accepts several props: duration allows you to change the duration of the animation, setting direction to the value x allows you to change the direction of our animation, RegularContent and FlippedContent give ability to display different content for flipped and non flipped variants.\n\nTry this example on Snack \nExpand the full code\n\nconst FlipCard = ({\n  isFlipped,\n  cardStyle,\n  direction = 'y',\n  duration = 500,\n  RegularContent,\n  FlippedContent,\n}) => {\n  const isDirectionX = direction === 'x';\n\n  const regularCardAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    const spinValue = interpolate(Number(isFlipped.value), [0, 1], [0, 180]);\n    const rotateValue = withTiming(`${spinValue}deg`, { duration });\n\n    return {\n      transform: [\n        isDirectionX ? { rotateX: rotateValue } : { rotateY: rotateValue },\n      ],\n    };\n  });\n\n  const flippedCardAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n    const spinValue = interpolate(Number(isFlipped.value), [0, 1], [180, 360]);\n    const rotateValue = withTiming(`${spinValue}deg`, { duration });\n\n    return {\n      transform: [\n        isDirectionX ? { rotateX: rotateValue } : { rotateY: rotateValue },\n      ],\n    };\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <Animated.View\n        style={[\n          flipCardStyles.regularCard,\n          cardStyle,\n          regularCardAnimatedStyle,\n        ]}>\n        {RegularContent}\n      </Animated.View>\n      <Animated.View\n        style={[\n          flipCardStyles.flippedCard,\n          cardStyle,\n          flippedCardAnimatedStyle,\n        ]}>\n        {FlippedContent}\n      </Animated.View>\n    </View>\n  );\n\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

The useSharedValue hook helps prevent unnecessary re-renders during state changes.\n\nExpand the full code\n  const isExpanded = useSharedValue(false);\n\n  const handlePress = () => {\n    isExpanded.value = !isExpanded.value;\n\n\nThe state is toggled when the main Actions button is pressed, which triggers animations for other secondary buttons.\n\nIt also relies on animatable values. Leveraging animatable values of rotation and position enables smooth transition between the two states.\n\nTry this example on Snack \nExpand the full code\n  const plusIconStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n\n    const moveValue = interpolate(Number(isExpanded.value), [0, 1], [0, 2]);\n\n    const translateValue = withTiming(moveValue);\n    const rotateValue = isExpanded.value ?

OFFSET * index : 0;\n\n    const translateValue = withSpring(-moveValue, SPRING_CONFIG);\n\n    const delay = index * 100;\n\n\n    const scaleValue = isExpanded.value ? 1 : 0;\n\n    return {\n      transform: [\n        { translateY: translateValue },\n        {\n          scale: withDelay(delay, withTiming(scaleValue)),\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <AnimatedPressable style={[animatedStyles, styles.shadow, styles.button]}>\n      <Animated.Text style={styles.content}>{buttonLetter}</Animated.Text>\n    </AnimatedPressable>\n  );\n};\n\n\nWe define the animated styles for the buttons within the FloatingActionButton component, passing the necessary values as props. The delay in their appearance on the screen is calculated based on the button's index. Buttons with a higher index will appear later and be positioned higher in the \"column\" of buttons.\n\nTry this example on Snack \nExpand the full code\n  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {\n\n    const moveValue = isExpanded.value ?

It's commonly seen in applications to information such as news tickers, advertisements, or any content that needs continuous display within a limited area.\n\nLooking for a ready-to-use solution? We recommend @animatereactnative/marquee.\n\nIt looks like reduced motion is turned on in your system preferences. Some of the animations may be skipped.

It determines the horizontal translation of the child components, creates clones of the children and animates them horizontally based on the specified duration.\n\nTry this example on Snack \nExpand the full code\nconst ChildrenScroller = ({\n  duration,\n  childrenWidth,\n  parentWidth,\n  reverse,\n  children,\n}) => {\n  const offset = useSharedValue(0);\n  const coeff = useSharedValue(reverse ? 1 : -1);\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    coeff.value = reverse ? 1 : -1;\n  }, [reverse]);\n\n  useFrameCallback((i) => {\n    // prettier-ignore\n    offset.value += (coeff.value * ((i.timeSincePreviousFrame ?? 1) * childrenWidth)) / duration;\n    offset.value = offset.value % childrenWidth;\n  }, true);\n\n  const count = Math.round(parentWidth / childrenWidth) + 2;\n  const renderChild = (index) => (\n    <TranslatedElement\n      key={`clone-${index}`}\n      index={index}\n      offset={offset}\n      childrenWidth={childrenWidth}>\n      {children}\n    </TranslatedElement>\n  );\n\n  return <Cloner count={count} renderChild={renderChild} />;\n};\n\n\nThe Marquee component serves as the main orchestrator of the marquee effect. It calculates necessary dimensions, renders child components within a container, and coordinates the animation by utilizing the ChildrenScroller component.\n\nTry this example on Snack \nExpand the full code\n  const [parentWidth, setParentWidth] = React.useState(0);\n  const [childrenWidth, setChildrenWidth] = React.useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <View\n      style={style}\n      onLayout={(ev) => {\n        setParentWidth(ev.nativeEvent.layout.width);\n      }}\n      pointerEvents=\"box-none\">\n      <View style={marqueeStyles.row} pointerEvents=\"box-none\">\n        <MeasureElement onLayout={setChildrenWidth}>{children}</MeasureElement>\n\n        {childrenWidth > 0 && parentWidth > 0 && (\n          <ChildrenScroller\n            duration={duration}\n            parentWidth={parentWidth}\n            childrenWidth={childrenWidth}\n            reverse={reverse}>\n            {children}\n          </ChildrenScroller>\n        )}\n      </View>\n    </View>\n  );\n};\n\n\n© Software Mansion 2026.

image\nfunction item image and the index image is going to be a string index is going\nis going to be a string index is going\nis going to be a string index is going to be number and it's going to render\nto be number and it's going to render\nto be number and it's going to render here A View and inside the view we are\nhere A View and inside the view we are\nhere A View and inside the view we are going to have an image is going to come\ngoing to have an image is going to come\ngoing to have an image is going to come from react\nfrom react\nfrom react native and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI image okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error saying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you know it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view that's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the children the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't forget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex of one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so now everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't have the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are going to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each individual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know the style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and the reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is going to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with multiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen with is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and the item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but again Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know oh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with

have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's

the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not

on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks

already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also

with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the

it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the

to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay

range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense

URI\nnative and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI image okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error saying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple

don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't forget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex of one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so now everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't have the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are going to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each individual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know the style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and the reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is going to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with multiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen with is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and the item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but again Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know oh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration now just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to uh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and uh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity uh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a full opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based on the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and I could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent itself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is going to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the elements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that we are going to use the

and\nuh animate reactnative stagger right and inside this stagger I'm going to render\ninside this stagger I'm going to render\ninside this stagger I'm going to render some text and I already have prepared\nsome text and I already have prepared\nsome text and I already have prepared some some text for you you so first\nsome some text for you you so first\nsome some text for you you so first let's import text from react native and\nlet's import text from react native and\nlet's import text from react native and we have like a a text saying welcome to\nwe have like a a text saying welcome to\nwe have like a a text saying welcome to animate react native.com and with this\nanimate react native.com and with this\nanimate react native.com and with this tagger if we are going to say here a key\ntagger if we are going to say here a key\ntagger if we are going to say here a key let's say random you'll see they they\nlet's say random you'll see they they\nlet's say random you'll see they they appear with a with a the small delay\nappear with a with a the small delay\nappear with a with a the small delay between each individual element we can\nbetween each individual element we can\nbetween each individual element we can also specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe 100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a small uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you know tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear one after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in between um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify some Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply style I'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen\nI'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen\nI'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen and I'll will justify the items to the\nand I'll will justify the items to the\nand I'll will justify the items to the center and all light the items to the\ncenter and all light the items to the\ncenter and all light the items to the center okay I'll align and connect\ncenter okay I'll align and connect\ncenter okay I'll align and connect everything here to the center the\neverything here to the center the\neverything here to the center the duration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going to be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an initial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100 1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll see they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1 second which is\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer and\nand\nand now you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself is going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here without any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any anything right and for that we can uh\nanything right and for that we can uh\nanything right and for that we can uh come to the to the children here of the\ncome to the to the children here of the\ncome to the to the children here of the Marquee and instead of a view we can\nMarquee and instead of a view we can\nMarquee and instead of a view we can have an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming from reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to use the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations so\nso\nso entering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh fade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1 second you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing easing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe 0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small animation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay this so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just half a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay everything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to bottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have access to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which we are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for the the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we have just created okay so\nhave just created okay so\nhave just created okay so item so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to lie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you uh there there was quite a lot of things happening on the screen\nlot of things happening on the screen\nlot of things happening on the screen you know from the Marquee element to the\nyou know from

stagger element and then we had some\nstagger element and then we had some\nstagger element and then we had some math to calculate where the actual\nmath to calculate where the actual\nmath to calculate where the actual element is going to be um visible uh\nelement is going to be um visible uh\nelement is going to be um visible uh calculate the left edge with the right\ncalculate the left

the screen is like\nwith the left edge of the screen is like\nwith the left edge of the screen is like it's insane it's like there are quite a\nit's insane it's like there are quite a\nit's insane it's like there are quite a lot of things to digest but at least we\nlot of things to digest but at least we\nlot of things to digest but at least we went through it and uh I hope that you\nwent

you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple

this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be

WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but again Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know oh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with

image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch

and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to

the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the

on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have access to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which we are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for the the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we have just created okay so\nhave just created okay so\nhave just created okay so item so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense

URI\nnative and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI image okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error saying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you know it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view that's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the children the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't forget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex of one so it's going to stret the

be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and the reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is going to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with multiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen with is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and the item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but again Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know oh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration now just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to uh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and uh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity uh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a full opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based on the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and I could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent itself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is going to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the elements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that we are going to use the

can\nbetween each individual element we can also specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe 100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a small uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you know tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear one after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in between um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify some Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply style I'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen\nI'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen\nI'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen and I'll will justify the items to the\nand I'll will justify the items to the\nand I'll will justify the items to the center and all light the items to the\ncenter and all light the items to the\ncenter and all light the items to the center okay I'll align and connect\ncenter okay I'll align and connect\ncenter okay I'll align and connect everything here to the center the\neverything here to the center the\neverything here to the center the duration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going to be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an initial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100 1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll see they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1 second which is\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer and\nand\nand now you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself is going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here without any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any anything right and for that we can uh\nanything right and for that we can uh\nanything right and for that we can uh come to the to the children here of the\ncome to the to the children here of the\ncome to the to the children here of the Marquee and instead of a view we can\nMarquee and instead of a view we can\nMarquee and instead of a view we can have an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming from reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to use the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations so\nso\nso entering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh fade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1 second you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing easing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe 0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small animation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay this so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just half a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay everything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to bottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have access to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which we are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for the the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we have just created okay so\nhave just created okay so\nhave just created okay so item so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to lie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you uh there there was quite a lot of things happening on the screen\nlot of things happening on the screen\nlot of things happening on the screen you know from the Marquee element to the\nyou know from

stagger element and then we had some\nstagger element and then we had some\nstagger element and then we had some math to calculate where the actual\nmath to calculate where the actual\nmath to calculate where the actual element is going to be um visible uh\nelement is going to be um visible uh\nelement is going to be um visible uh calculate the left edge with the right\ncalculate the left

the screen is like\nwith the left edge of the screen is like\nwith the left edge of the screen is like it's insane it's like there are quite a\nit's insane it's like there are quite a\nit's insane it's like there are quite a lot of things to digest but at least we\nlot of things to digest but at least we\nlot of things to digest but at least we went through it and uh I hope that you\nwent

you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple

this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be

WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a

it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration now just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to uh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and uh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity uh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a full opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's

and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to

the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the elements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that we are going to use the

delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay everything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to bottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also

with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the

it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense

you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you know it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture

at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the

and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with

image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and uh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity uh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a full opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's

and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent itself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is going to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the elements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that we are going to use the

they appear with a with a the small delay\nappear with a with a the small delay\nappear with a with a the small delay between each individual element we can\nbetween each individual element we can\nbetween each individual element we can also specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe 100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a small uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you know tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear one after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in between um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify some Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply

to the\nand I'll will justify the items to the\nand I'll will justify the items to the center and all light the items to the\ncenter and all light the items to the\ncenter and all light the items to the center okay I'll align and connect\ncenter okay I'll align and connect\ncenter okay I'll align and connect everything here to the center the\neverything here to the center the\neverything here to the center the duration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going to be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an initial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100 1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll see they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1 second which is\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer and\nand\nand now you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself is going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here without any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any anything right and for that we can uh\nanything right and for that we can uh\nanything right and for that we can uh come to the to the children here of the\ncome to the to the children here of the\ncome to the to the children here of the Marquee and instead of a view we can\nMarquee and instead of a view we can\nMarquee and instead of a view we can have an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming from reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to use the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations so\nso\nso entering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh fade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1 second you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing easing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe 0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small animation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay this so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just half a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay everything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to bottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have access to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which we are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for the the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we have just created okay so\nhave just created okay so\nhave just created okay so item so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to lie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you

URI\nnative and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI image okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error saying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you know it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture

en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so now everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't have the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are going to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each individual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know the style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and the reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is going to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with multiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the

WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but again Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know oh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration now just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to uh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and uh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity uh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a full opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based on the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and I could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent itself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is going to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the elements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that we are going to use the

delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay everything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to bottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also

with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the

it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense

URI\nnative and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI image okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error saying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you know it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view that's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the children the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't forget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex of one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so now everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't have the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are going to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each individual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know the style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and the reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is going to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be

WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but again Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know oh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration now just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to uh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and uh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity uh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a full opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based on the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and I could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent itself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is going to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the elements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that we are going to use the animate reative\nwe are going to use the animate reative\nwe are going to use the animate reative stagger element or stagger component\nstagger element or stagger component\nstagger element or stagger

disappear\nelements when they appear or disappear\nelements when they appear or disappear on the screen we are going to use a\non the screen we are going to use a\non the screen we are going to use a stagger that's coming from reactnative\nstagger that's coming from reactnative\nstagger that's coming from reactnative uh animate reactnative stagger right and\nuh animate reactnative stagger right and\nuh animate reactnative stagger right and inside this stagger I'm going to render\ninside this stagger I'm going to render\ninside this stagger I'm going to render some text and I already have prepared\nsome text and I already have prepared\nsome text and I already have prepared some some text for you you so first\nsome some text for you you so first\nsome some text for you you so first let's import text from react native and\nlet's import text from react native and\nlet's import text from react native and we have like a a text saying welcome to\nwe have like a a text saying welcome

key\ntagger if we are going to say here a key\ntagger if we are going to say here a key let's say random you'll see they they\nlet's say random you'll see they they\nlet's say random you'll see they they appear with a with a the small delay\nappear with a with a the small delay\nappear with a with a the small delay between each individual element we can\nbetween each individual element we can\nbetween each individual element we can also specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe 100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a small uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you know tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear one after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in between um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify some Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply style I'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen\nI'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen\nI'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen and I'll will justify the items

the center the duration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going to be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an initial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100 1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll see they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1 second which is\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer and\nand\nand now you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself is going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here without any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any anything right and for that we can uh\nanything right and for that we can uh\nanything right and for that we can uh come to the to the children here of the\ncome to the to the children here of the\ncome to the to the children here of the Marquee and instead of a view we can\nMarquee and instead of a view we can\nMarquee and instead of a view we can have an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming from reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to use the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations so\nso\nso entering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh fade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1 second you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing easing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe 0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small animation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay this so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just half a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay everything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to bottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have access to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which we are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for the the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we have just created okay so\nhave just created okay so\nhave just created okay so item so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to lie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you

now I have prepared\nmiddle of the screen now I have prepared some mock data that we are going to be\nsome mock data that we are going to be\nsome mock data that we are going to be using it's basically a list of images\nusing it's basically a list of images\nusing it's basically a list of images that we are going to be using them for\nthat we are going to be using them for\nthat we are going to be using them for displaying inside the Carousel and also\ndisplaying inside the Carousel and also\ndisplaying inside the Carousel and also for the background image okay and let's\nfor the background image okay and let's\nfor the background image okay and let's start by creating the Carousel and first\nstart by creating the Carousel and first\nstart by creating the Carousel and first I would like to\nI would like to\nI would like to import from animate reative Marquee I\nimport from animate reative Marquee I\nimport from animate reative Marquee I would like to import the Marquee\nwould like to import the Marquee\nwould like to import the Marquee component and this Marquee component\ncomponent and this Marquee component\ncomponent and this Marquee component accepts uh children that's going to\naccepts uh children that's going to\naccepts uh children that's going to repeat over time instead of the text\nrepeat over time instead of the text\nrepeat over time instead of the text here let's apply a marquee and this\nhere let's apply a marquee and this\nhere let's apply a marquee and this Marque is going to render a view and we\nMarque is going to render a view and we\nMarque is going to render a view and we will iterate over the images map get the\nwill iterate over the images map get the\nwill iterate over the images map get the image and the index and we are going to\nimage and the index and we are going to\nimage and the index and we are going to return here an\nreturn here an\nreturn here an item that's also the image you know as\nitem that's also the image you know as\nitem that's also the image you know as image the index as index and important\nimage the index as index and important\nimage the index as index and important the don't forget about the key so it's\nthe don't forget about the key so it's\nthe don't forget about the key so it's going to be image and the index okay\ngoing to be image and the index okay\ngoing to be image and the index okay let's also create this item the item\nlet's also create this item the item\nlet's also create this item the item function item image and the index image\nfunction item image and the index image\nfunction item image and the index image is going to be a string index is going\nis going to be a string index is going\nis going to be a string index is going to be number and it's going to render\nto be number and it's going to render\nto be number and it's going to render here A View and inside the view we are\nhere A View and inside the view we are\nhere A View and inside the view we are going to have an image is going to come\ngoing to have an image is going to come\ngoing to have an image is going to come from react\nfrom react\nfrom react native and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI image okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error saying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you know it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view that's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the children the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't forget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex of one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so now everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't have the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are going to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each individual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know the style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and the reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is going to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with multiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen with is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and the item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but again Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know oh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration now just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to uh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and uh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity uh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a full opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's

and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent itself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is going to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the

on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also

with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the

it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense

URI\nnative and source is going to be URI\nnative and source is going to be URI image okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error\nimage okay so now we have this error saying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a\nsaying you know gure detector must be a descend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View\ndescend of of gesture Handler root View and uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is\nand uh the reason this is complaining is because you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component\nbecause you know the Marquee component depends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need\ndepends on the gure Handler so we need to wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our\nto wrap the entire application with our um uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go\num uh gure Handler root view so if we go back to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we\nback to the app itself you know where we render the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you\nrender the Apple invites we can say you know it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view\nknow it's gesture Handler root view that's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the\nthat's going to render inside as the children the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't\nchildren the Apple invites and don't forget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex\nforget that we need to also pass a flex of one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so\nof one so it's going to stret the en so now everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't\nnow everything should work but we don't have the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are\nhave the images themselves so we are going to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each\ngoing to have a sty sty for each individual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know\nindividual image so actually you know the style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and\nthe style is going to be Flex one and the reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is\nthe reason is because um this image is going to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so\ngoing to take the space of this view so we're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view\nwe're going to say you know the view itself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item\nitself is going to have a with of item with a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border\nwith a height of item height and Border radius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to\nradius okay and the item wi is going to be uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let\nbe uh dependent on the screen WID so let first we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID\nfirst we need to get the WID from dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE\nfrom dimensions that's coming from RE native get the\nnative get the\nnative get the window and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with\nwindow and item with is going to be with multiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen\nmultiplied by 62 so 62% of the screen with is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and\nwith is going to be one item with and the item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID\nthe item height is going to be item WID multiplied by\nmultiplied by\nmultiplied by 1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the\n1.67 okay hit save and now we have the eye elements um great and\neye elements um great and\neye elements um great and also don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border\nalso don't forget to apply a border radius of\nradius of\nradius of 160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the\n160 to the image and also remove the Border radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself\nBorder radius for from The View itself okay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is\nokay and now this is also this is looking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View\nlooking like this because the The View that's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has\nthat's rendering inside this Marquee has a flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would\na flex direction of column and we would like to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but\nlike to have it a direction of row but again Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know\nagain Marquee is going to say you know oh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60\noh okay so this view it's just taking 60 2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat\n2% of the screen whip so let's repeat this um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can\nthis um n amount of times so we we can also Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would\nalso Loop through it okay but we would like to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of\nlike to make this a flex direction of row and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to\nrow and now all the images are going to be uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all\nbe uh this view is going to contain all the images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to\nthe images as a row and Mark is going to repeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a\nrepeat this entire row okay also apply a gap\ngap\ngap now a gap of\nnow a gap of\nnow a gap of spacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the\nspacing let's define the spacing at the top here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be\ntop here so con spacing is going to be let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say 16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's\n16 and the Marquee itself when it's going to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can\ngoing to repeat that view uh you can also specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned\nalso specify the gap between cloned items you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify\nitems you know and you can specify spacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going\nspacing is spacing so now when he going to uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with\nto uh clone another another view with this uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend\nthis uh with the images is going to pend the spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of\nthe spacing between the elements of course you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you\ncourse you can do if it's reverse you know it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if\nknow it's going to change the offset if it's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move\nit's uh not reverse it's going to move from right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also\nfrom right to left and you can also specify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will\nspecify different directions but we will stick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in\nstick with the horizontal Direction in this tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about\nthis tutorial another cool thing about this Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify\nthis Marquee is that you can specify shared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh\nshared value as a position prop uh that's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in\nthat's going to be changed over time in order to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to\norder to do so we actually need to create the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value\ncreate the offset as a shared value that's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this\nthat's starting from zero and get this offset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to\noffset and pass it down as a position to to the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to\nto the Mary so when the Mark is going to change the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will\nchange the the offset inside we will also change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value\nalso change this offset shared value based on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some\nbased on which we are going to do some math and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index\nmath and uh see what's the actual index of the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the\nof the image that's uh currently in the middle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you\nmiddle of the screen based on which you are going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the\nare going to render an image in the background apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some\nbackground apply some blur and some entering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and\nentering and exiting animations and force Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we\nforce Mount and unmount that image so we can create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's\ncan create this morph between let's start by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the\nstart by by displaying that image in the background okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have\nbackground okay uh we are going to have a a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to\na a view here and this view is going to have an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to\nhave an image The View again is going to have a style\nhave a style\nhave a style sheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native\nsheet that's coming from react native absolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going\nabsolute F object okay so we are going to stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen\nto stray the entire the entire screen and the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex\nand the image is going to have a flex one and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to\none and the source for now is going to be the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an\nbe the first image convert this to be an animated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from\nanimated image animated is coming from rect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the\nrect native reanimated and to force the mount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we\nmount and unmount of the images we actually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key\nactually need to specify an unique key so in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image\nso in our example is going to be image by some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also\nby some active index you know and also uh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index\nuh change the images by the active index and over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change\nand over time we are going to change this uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so\nthis uh State as active index okay so let's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active\nlet's create the state itself so active index and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state\nindex and set active index use state zero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first\nzero so now we have the first first image so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second\nimage so when we are going to say second is the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is\nis the second image okay but this is going to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed\ngoing to be calculated and changed dynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee\ndynamically based on the Marquee position or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what\nposition or offset position okay so what we actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a\nwe actually need to do is to use a really special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in\nreally special hook available for us in react native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's\nreact native reanimated and that's called use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can\ncalled use animated reaction so you can react to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and\nreact to some shared value changes and then you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any\nthen you can set State you can call any API first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any\nAPI first we need to import use any animated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated\nanimated reaction okay and this animated reaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods\nreaction accepts two different methods one is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a\none is the what to react on so it's a method that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset\nmethod that's going to return the offset do value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going\ndo value and another method that's going to get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with\nto get this value and do something with it you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a\nit you know and we are going to get a value and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to\nvalue and here inside we are going to calculate the\ncalculate the\ncalculate the index and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how\nindex and set state with the index how are we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate\nare we go actually going to calculate the offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this\nthe offset well the offset itself this is a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm\nis a value you know it's like if I'm going to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and\ngoing to console loog the value here and open up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal\nopen up the open up the the terminal here you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going\nhere you'll see that this value is going to change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is\nto change over time you know but this is not great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to\nnot great you know we actually need to have the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual\nhave the the index of each individual image so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset\nimage so in order to get this offset value uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position\nvalue uh based on the screen position and also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple\nand also the item with it's a simple math formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come\nmath formula and we are going to come here to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are\nhere to the first reaction and we are going to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset\ngoing to say you know return offset value divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item\nvalue divided by the item with everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images\nwith everything modulo how many images do we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is\ndo we have images. length and this is going to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly\ngoing to give us basically roughly what's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now\nwhat's going to be the the index so now if I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll\nif I open up again the terminal you'll see it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two\nsee it's like oh it's one it's maybe two you know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the\nyou know it's this is the index the calculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh\ncalculation is not that great because uh as you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between\nas you can see we have a gap in between each individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the\neach individual item so instead of the item width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an\nitem width we actually need to Define an item size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that\nitem size and take into account that spacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the\nspacing between the items Define the constant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be\nconstant so its item size is going to be item wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know\nitem wi plus the spacing you know because we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing\nbecause we are going to apply a spacing between the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's\nbetween the elements and now let's recalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this\nrecalculate the offset based on this item size not item\nitem size not item\nitem size not item width and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value\nwidth and what we can do with this value now if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal\nnow if we open up again the terminal this it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would\nthis it's a float value and we would like to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to\nlike to have it a fixed value and uh to do so we actually\ndo so we actually\ndo so we actually before uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to\nbefore uh we say float index is going to be assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and\nbe assigned this to a float index and now we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L\nnow we actually need to return a math L and then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if\nand then the float index okay and now if we open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see\nwe open up the the simulator you see it's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and\nit's like now it's going to be five and now it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so\nnow it's going to be six and so on so even if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and\neven if we are going to move it and basically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like\nbasically reload so you see it's like it's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but\nit's zero it's one it's two you know but there is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem\nthere is a small problem and the problem is that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now\nis that this Carousel it's bire and now if we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand\nif we are going to move on the left hand side you see the index is\nside you see the index is\nside you see the index is actually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any\nactually uh negative we don't have any negative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we\nnegative indexes inside the images so we actually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value\nactually need to take the absolute value of that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math\nof that so uh where we return the math math floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math\nmath floor we actually need to do math absolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay\nabsolute value of this flooor value okay and now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to\nand now open up and there it's going to work and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state\nwork and how we are going to set state with this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use\nwith this value well we need to uh use the run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set\nthe run on JS first call the method set active index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the\nactive index and then pass down the value so it's zero boom boom you\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we\nsee there is a small issue right cuz we would like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide\nwould like to make the the active slide when you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle\nwhen you are with the edge in the middle of the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to\nof the screen so we actually need to compensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the\ncompensate that by uh when we do the offset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus\noffset here we actually need to do plus with of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so\nwith of the screen divided by two so this divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going\nthis divided by the item size is going to give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active\nto give us you know who's the active index so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going\nindex so now if the left Edge is going to meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are\nto meet the middle of the screen we are going to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now\ngoing to to set the active index and now cuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index\ncuz we properly get this uh active index we can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and\nwe can actually apply an entering and exiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's\nexiting animation but before that let's blur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the\nblur the image so we can specify to the image itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this\nimage itself a blur radius of 50 so this is going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the\nis going to apply a blur radius to the image and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an\nimage and now we are going to have an entering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from\nentering as fade in that's coming from reag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically\nreag native reanimated is basically mounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify\nmounting the element uh and also specify duration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the\nduration of 1 second and also the exiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or\nexiting so when we are going to Mount or remove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also\nremove that element we are going to also have an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag\nhave an Fade Out that's coming from reag native reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration\nnative reanimated with the same duration now just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to\nnow just like magic when we are going to uh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph\nuh render an image is going to um morph between the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this\nbetween the changes you see we have this small small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really\nsmall small transition and really awesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements\nawesome transition between the elements now there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I\nnow there are a couple of things that I would like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the\nwould like to fix the first one is the background of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application\nbackground of the entire application I'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0\nI'll say ground color is going to be 0 0 Z so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh\nZ so we are going to have a black uh color in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are\ncolor in the background so now we are not going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and\nnot going to see the glitch itself and uh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity\nuh I would like to also apply an opacity uh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a\nuh and uh I don't want to have like a full opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based\nfull opacity when it's visible uh based on the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and\non the fade in or Fade Out you know and I could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you\nI could easily go here and change you know the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you\nknow the opacity to five let's say you know but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit\nknow but there is an issue so if I hit re reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of\nre reload here you'll see that um and of course un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value\ncourse un comment the console log value you'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you\nyou'll see that reanimated saying you know the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already\nknow the property opacity it's already animated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so\nanimated by the entering and exiting so setting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a\nsetting the style with an opacity or a custom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be\ncustom opacity is going to be overwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout\noverwritten you know by the layout animation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's\nanimation so in order to fix that that's the main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have\nthe main reason basically why we have this view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so\nthis view wrapper for the image so instead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to\ninstead of applying the opacity to to the image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been\nthe image that's it's already been changed by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we\nchanged by the entering and exiting we can move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent\ncan move that uh to the to the parent itself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is\nitself and say you know this view is going to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the\ngoing to have an opacity 0.5 and the animated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an\nanimated image is going to have an entering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so\nentering and exiting with a fade in so reanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain\nreanimated is not going to complain anymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going\nanymore you know this uh this is going to be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be\nto be over written it's not going to be over written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we\nover written anymore you know and now we have this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition\nhave this beautiful beautiful transition in the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the\nin the background now let me add the the elements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that\nelements in the footer right so for that we are going to use the animate reative\nwe are going to use the animate reative\nwe are going to use the animate reative stagger element or stagger component\nstagger element or stagger component\nstagger element or stagger

disappear\nelements when they appear or disappear\nelements when they appear or disappear on the screen we are going to use a\non the screen we are going to use a\non the screen we are going to use a stagger that's coming from reactnative\nstagger that's coming from reactnative\nstagger that's coming from reactnative uh animate reactnative stagger right and\nuh animate reactnative stagger right and\nuh animate reactnative stagger right and inside this stagger I'm going to render\ninside this stagger I'm going to render\ninside this stagger I'm going to render some text and I already have prepared\nsome text and I already have prepared\nsome text and I already have prepared some some text for you you so first\nsome some text for you you so first\nsome some text for you you so first let's import text from react native and\nlet's import text from react native and\nlet's import text from react native and we have like a a text saying welcome to\nwe have like a a text saying welcome

key\ntagger if we are going to say here a key\ntagger if we are going to say here a key let's say random you'll see they they\nlet's say random you'll see they they\nlet's say random you'll see they they appear with a with a the small delay\nappear with a with a the small delay\nappear with a with a the small delay between each individual element we can\nbetween each individual element we can\nbetween each individual element we can also specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe\nalso specify the Stagger itself maybe 100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a\n100 so they will appear with a with a small uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you\nsmall uh even bigger you know tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear\nknow tick tick tick you know they appear one after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in\none after the other with with a delay in between um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify\nbetween um and uh we can also specify some Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply style\nsome Styles so I'll just apply style I'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen\nI'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen\nI'll do Flex 0.5 just half of the screen and I'll will justify the items to the\nand I'll will justify the items to the\nand I'll will justify the items to the center and all light the items to the\ncenter and all light the items to the\ncenter and all light the items to

the center the duration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going\nduration of the entire stagger is going to be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an\nto be 500 and we can also have an initial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100\ninitial entering delay of let's say 100 1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll\n1 second so now if I hit reload you'll see they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1\nsee they appear after 1 second which is\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer\ngreat F okay great so we have the footer and\nand\nand now you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself\nnow you see poof the the carousel itself is going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here\nis going to be rendered directly here without any like animation or any\nwithout any like animation or any\nwithout any

animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming\nhave an animated view animated is coming from reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to\nfrom reative and again we are going to use the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations\nuse the entering and exiting animations so\nso\nso entering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh\nentering let's say is going to be uh fade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1\nfade in from up with a duration of 1 second you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing\nsecond you know and the easing easing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe\neasing from reag elastic maybe 0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small\n0.9 H reload there is a small small animation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay\nanimation you know I also like to delay this so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just\nthis so delay is going to be 500 just half a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay\nhalf a second I'm going to delay everything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to\neverything so they appear from top to bottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on\nbottom but I don't like the position on the y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really\nthe y axis so they're starting really really small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh\nreally small you know and I like to uh Define the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh\nDefine the the Y position position uh basically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this\nbasically the initial y position of this fade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can\nfade in up and to do so we actually can go here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with\ngo here at the end and Define with initial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have\ninitial values and I would like to have a\na\na transform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I\ntransform Translate Y and I'll do item I ided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we\nided by two with a minus so basically we move up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so\nmove up half the the the item height so now if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come\nnow if I hit reload it's going to come really from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided\nreally from minus item height I divided by two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like\nby two which is great you know it's like this is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear\nthis is how it's it's going to appear it's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation\nit's it's really smooth this animation itself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take\nitself looks really good let's take another look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like\nanother look at it you know it's like everything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course\neverything looks already good of course instead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add\ninstead of stagger here I can also add 100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they\n100 milliseconds so it's like it's they going to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in\ngoing to appear really fast but in addition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing\naddition to everything apple is doing something really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's\nsomething really awesome and that's the rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for\nthe rotation or small small rotation for each individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this\neach individual El M within this Carousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle\nCarousel so when you are in the middle of the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and\nof the screen you have rotation zero and then if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side\nthen if you are on the left hand side you have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we\nyou have like we we rotate we interpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and\ninterpolate based on the position and rotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite\nrotate the element and that's quite tricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is\ntricky to do right but the nice thing is that we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the\nthat we actually have access to the offset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many\noffset we also have access to how many images we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have\nimages we are display and we also have access to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which\naccess to the item size based on which we are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for\nwe are going to uh Define the range for the the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with\nthe the window where this element with index zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be\nindex zero let's say is going to be visible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a\nvisible and we are going to apply a different interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the\ndifferent interpolation and change the angle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like\nangle for example okay it's more like phases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's\nphases you know if it's entering if it's in the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you\nin the middle or if it's uh exiting you know so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that\nknow so we are going to Define that range and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to\nrange and to do so we actually need to come where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the\ncome where we uh render the item and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know\nitem and uh pass this Offset you know like the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we\nlike the offset the shared value that we have just created okay so\nhave just created okay so\nhave just created okay so item so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive\nitem so item it's going to also receive the offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the\nthe offset so we are going to have the index and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we\nindex and also the offset and now if we go to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the\ngo to the item itself also add the offset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to\noffset here and the offset is going to be you know\nbe you know\nbe you know offset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay\noffset shared value as a number okay what we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated\nwhat we can do with is create a animated style Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use\nstyle Define this range and then use interpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you\ninterpolate to uh change the angle you know and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here\nknow and let's start by creating here the Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be\nthe Styles and the Styles is going to be used animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are\nused animated style and then we are going to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with\ngoing to return some Styles and with these\nthese\nthese Styles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the\nStyles we would like to apply it to the view that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so\nview that's rendering the image okay so we are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to\nwe are going to first transform this to be an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and\nbe an animated View animated View and also have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this\nalso have the Styles applied to to this animated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing\nanimated view okay nothing nothing should be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything\nshould be uh changed here everything should work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can\nshould work the same but now uh we can come to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply\ncome to the animated style and apply some math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know\nsome math and uh get this range you know where this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this\nwhere this uh this image let's say this image here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to\nimage here is going to be come come to the scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit\nthe scene be fully visible and also exit the in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that\nthe in you know this is the range that we are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually\nwe are interested in first we actually need to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial\nneed to get the the item initial position so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is\nposition so I'll say item position is going to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply\ngoing to be you know the index multiply by the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to\nby the item size then we also need to calculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of\ncalculate the entire the entire size of this Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you\nthis Marquee element so I'll say you know the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh\nknow the total size is going to be uh images length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item\nimages length multiplied by the item size okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can\nsize okay that's great and now we can also calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so\nalso calculate the the range itself so the range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item\nthe range is going to be the item position and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract\nposition and we are going to subtract the offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know\nthe offset value it's basically you know this is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the\nthis is the initial position this is the offset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take\noffset so we are going to um take whatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is\nwhatever the item initial position is and offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start\nand offset it it pretty much to start from from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the\nfrom from the left edge of the of the screen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this\nscreen and now we are going to get this and do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now\nand do modulo by the total size so now the range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero\nthe range is going to be between zero and wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log\nand wi of the screen if I console log the range\nthe range\nthe range range but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index\nrange but only console log only if index is zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the\nis zero you know I'll console log the range okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the\nrange okay so hit reload you see the range is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and\nrange is going to be minus whatever and it's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease\nit's going to just decrease decrease decrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm\ndecrease but the thing is that I'm actually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an\nactually interested in uh applying an an initial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements\ninitial offset as well to the elements so I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range\nso I would like to have the range starting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left\nstarting from the uh uh when the left edge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of\nedge of the image it's the right edge of the screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of\nthe screen and when the right edge of the image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the\nthe image it's on the left edge of the screen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to\nscreen so for that we actually need to increase the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially\nincrease the the window range initially I'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the\nI'll subtract here the width of the screen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by\nscreen minus the the item size divide by two and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add\ntwo and on the Range itself I will add here to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the\nhere to the entire thing I will add the Wii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay\nWii plus item size divided by two okay so in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a\nso in this way we are going to have a different range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to\ndifferent range so the range is going to be uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with\nbe uh between minus item size and with pretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the\npretty much now we can go back to the transform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be\ntransform state is going to be interpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to\ninterpolate and we're going to interpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input\ninterpolate the range and the input range is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size\nrange is going to be minus item size middle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave\nmiddle of the screen let's let's leave it as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of\nit as zero for now and then the WID of the screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be\nthe screen left hand side is going to be minus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is\nminus 3° otherwise is zero otherwise is 3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to\n3° so it's going to be it's going to come like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something\ncome like it's going to be something like this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is\nlike this you know it's going to come is zero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know\nzero and then is moving you know something like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about\nsomething like that and the thing about the rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs\nthe rotation is going this is this needs to be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be\nto be a string so it's going to be interpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees\ninterpolate and then pass the degrees okay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of\nokay so now we have some sort of rotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we\nrotation so if I hit reload again we have a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's\nhave a sort of rotation you know it's like but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to\nlike but is not what we actually want to have yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this\nhave yeah there is a small issue so this is going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and\nis going to be minus item size zero and with okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like\nwith okay and now as you can see like when when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image\nwhen when the the left edge of the image is going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have\nis going to be zero uh is going to have 0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually\n0 degrees and we would like to actually offset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of\noffset this to be here in the middle of the screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the\nthe screen you know it's like not at the edge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of\nedge of the screen but in the middle of the screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is\nthe screen so instead of zero here is going to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size\ngoing to be with minus item size everything divided by\neverything divided by\neverything divided by reload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there\nreload everything is going to work there is a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is\nis a small issue and the the issue is that you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is\nthat you see when again the offset is going to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to\ngoing to be uh negative we are going to mess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and\nmess around with the interpolation and nothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and\nnothing is going to pretty much work and there is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what\nthere is a small hack you know uh what if we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000\nif we are going to compensate by 1,000 times basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you\ntimes basically we are going to say you know the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the\nknow the offset it's actually when the user has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the\nuser has already scrolled through the entire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we\nentire Marquee 1,000 times and then we are going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are\nare going to calculate it so we are going to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is\ngoing to say you know this offset is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to be uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the\nbe uh the offset value itself plus the total size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know\ntotal size multiplied by 1,000 you know just offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now\njust offset everything by 1,000 so now it doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can\nit doesn't matter how I I mean you can you can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one\nyou can fake it so you can scroll one 1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but\n1,000 time you know in the past but who's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we\nwho's going to do it so in this way we are going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small\nare going to fix this small the small thingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the\nthingy that we had with the with the offset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it\noffset value itself that was it guys it was an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to\nwas an intense tutorial I'm not going to lie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you uh there there was quite a\nlie to you

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a

so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe

is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto

let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot

but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is

working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also

since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

flip\nand in order to flip\nand in order to flip we just need i believe to\nwe just need i believe to\nwe just need i believe to specify here n minus index\nspecify here n minus index\nspecify here n minus index multiplied by square size\nmultiplied by square size\nmultiplied by square size so\nso\nso or index minus n so let's reload we are\nor index minus n so let's reload we are\nor index minus n so let's reload we are going to figure it out\nso of course here we need the index\nso of course here we need the index minus n\nand the let's uh uh\nand the let's uh uh so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working nicely\nworking nicely\nworking nicely so uh here n minus index or

sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the orientation\norientation\norientation so here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little bit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the width timing\nwidth timing\nwidth timing and let's reload\nand we can see in the end that the\nand we can see in the end that the animation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly so of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and over this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in order to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use another high order function that is\nanother high order function that is\nanother high order function that is called with repeat\ncalled with repeat\ncalled with repeat so let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with

let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want a number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1 so minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is equal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite repetitions\nrepetitions\nrepetitions so\nso\nso let's reload\nand let's see if everything is working\nand let's see if everything is working nicely\nso the first two rounds seems to works\nso the first two rounds seems to works just work fine\njust work fine\njust work fine but here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for the second time and for the third time\nthe second time and

so\nso\nso we can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the width timing function\nwidth timing function\nwidth timing function so uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this opacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this opacity to\nopacity to\nopacity to improve the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we don't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation so let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final\nso

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by

quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this

bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a

square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe

be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this

bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square

package.json you can see that\nin the package.json you can see that\nin the package.json you can see that i've already installed just the\ni've already installed just the\ni've already installed just the reanimate package we are going to use a\nreanimate package we are going to use a\nreanimate package we are going to use a version above the 2.0\nversion above the 2.0\nversion above the 2.0 the

reanimated installation\ncomplete the reanimated installation process\nprocess\nprocess so that said we can start to update the\nso that said we can start to update the\nso that said we can start to update the background color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black background color\nbackground color\nbackground color let's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get rid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text so here we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return this value right here\nthis value right here\nthis value right here and let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value so basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want that if\nthat if\nthat if the rotate value\nthe rotate value\nthe rotate value is equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the rotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square

the\nconsistent with the\nconsistent with the with the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y and let's reload\nand let's reload\nand let's reload so i believe it was glitched\nso i believe it was glitched\nso i believe it was glitched and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working nicely let's just\nworking nicely let's just\nworking nicely let's just use here the with spring\nuse here the with spring\nuse here the with spring high order function\nhigh

handling\nso of course here here we are handling\nso of course here here we are handling the first round the first rotation let's\nthe first round the first rotation let's\nthe first round the first rotation let's handle uh\nhandle uh\nhandle uh so the second rotation so we are going\nso the second rotation so we are going\nso the second rotation so we are going to animate the progress dot value until\nto animate the progress dot value until\nto animate the progress dot value until the value for a pi\nthe value for a pi\nthe value for a pi so if we load we can see that\nso if we load we can see that\nso if we load we can see that not everything is working at all\nnot everything is working at all\nnot everything is working at all and we need to find we need to handle\nand we need to find we need to handle\nand we need to find we need to handle the second rotation manually\nthe second rotation manually\nthe second rotation manually so let's start from the rotate\nso let's start from the rotate\nso let's start from the rotate the rotate derived value\nthe rotate derived value\nthe rotate derived value so we know that this condition right\nso we know that this condition right\nso we know that this condition right here\nhere\nhere is perfect but it is perfect when the\nis perfect but it is perfect when the\nis perfect but it is perfect when the progress dot value is less than two pi\nprogress dot value is less than two pi\nprogress dot value is less than two pi so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say if progress to\nif progress to\nif progress to etherprogress.value is

the\notherwise let's return the\notherwise let's return the progress.value\nprogress.value\nprogress.value so let's see\nand we can see that uh\nand we can see that uh nothing is working so the second\nnothing is working so the second\nnothing is working so the second rotation is not working at all basically\nrotation is not working at all basically\nrotation is not working at all basically uh so in order to visualize better\nuh so in order to visualize better\nuh so in order to visualize better what's going on let's extend the\nwhat's going on let's extend the\nwhat's going on let's extend the duration to 8 seconds\nduration to 8 seconds\nduration to 8 seconds and let's reload\nso here we can see that we don't want\nso here we can see that we don't want instantly that the

will be\nso here the progress dot value will be\nso here the progress dot value will be greater than 2 pi and we need just to\ngreater than 2 pi and we need just to\ngreater than 2 pi and we need just to decrease the progress dot value\ndecrease the progress dot value\ndecrease the progress dot value in order to compare with the final angle\nin order to compare with the final angle\nin order to

let's reload\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working almost nicely\nworking almost nicely\nworking almost nicely so uh\nso uh\nso uh what is happening right here and what do\nwhat is happening right here and what do\nwhat is happening right here and what do we so the rotation animation is working\nwe so the rotation animation is working\nwe so the rotation animation is working nicely but we need to fix this uh\nnicely but we need to fix this uh\nnicely but we need to fix this uh translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y animation and what what do we want to

sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the orientation\norientation\norientation so here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little bit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the width timing\nwidth timing\nwidth timing and let's reload\nand we can see in the end that the\nand we can see in the end that the animation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly so of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and over this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in order to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use another high order function that is\nanother high order function that is\nanother high order function that is called with repeat\ncalled with repeat\ncalled with repeat so let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with

let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want a number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1 so minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is equal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite repetitions\nrepetitions\nrepetitions so\nso\nso let's reload\nand let's see if everything is working\nand let's see if everything is working nicely\nso the first two rounds seems to works\nso the first two rounds seems to works just work fine\njust work fine\njust work fine but here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for the second time and for the third time\nthe second time and

so\nso\nso we can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the width timing function\nwidth timing function\nwidth timing function so uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this opacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for

value\nthe rotate value\nthe rotate value is equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the rotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a

square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different

be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this

let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot

the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the

between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot

otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between

pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is

default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be

outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be

changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we

since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the with repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function and here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want a number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1 so minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is equal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite repetitions\nrepetitions\nrepetitions so\nso\nso let's reload\nand let's see if everything is working\nand let's see if everything is working nicely\nso the first two rounds seems to works\nso the first two rounds seems to works just work fine\njust work fine\njust work fine but here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for the second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time we can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch here\nhere\nhere so\nso\nso we can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the width timing function\nwidth timing function\nwidth timing function so uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this opacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this opacity to\nopacity to\nopacity to improve the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we don't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation so let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final result\nso\nso here we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking

update the background color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black background color\nbackground color\nbackground color let's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get rid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text so here we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return this value right here\nthis value right here\nthis value right here and let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot

animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a

square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to

it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus

minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright

pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot

otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between

pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this

outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe

is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto

otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso

but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is

working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also

since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

y we actually let's uh\ntranslate y we actually let's uh\ntranslate y we actually let's uh visualize these squares we know that at\nvisualize these squares we know that at\nvisualize these squares we know that at the beginning\nthe beginning\nthe beginning the last square is right here and the\nthe last square is right here and the\nthe last square is right here and the first\nfirst\nfirst the first square is like right here\nthe first square is like right here\nthe first square is like right here so if we run the animation\nso if we run the animation\nso if we run the animation we can see that we want to flip\nwe can see that we want to flip\nwe can see that we want to flip the order of these squares so we want\nthe order of these squares so we want\nthe order of these squares so we want that the last one\nthat the last one\nthat the last one became become the first one and the vice\nbecame become the first one and the vice\nbecame become the first one and the vice versa so as a friend of mine would say\nversa so as a friend of mine would say\nversa so as a friend of mine would say we want that the first will be last and\nwe want that the first will be last and\nwe want that the first will be last and the last will be first\nthe last will be first\nthe last will be first and in order to\nand in order to\nand in order to handle this kind of behavior\nhandle this kind of behavior\nhandle this kind of behavior we just need to fix here the translate\nwe just need to fix here the translate\nwe just need to fix here the translate why\nwhy\nwhy the translate y amount\nthe translate y amount\nthe translate y amount if the progress dot value is greater\nif the progress dot value is greater\nif the progress dot value is greater than 2 pi\nso here we want to flip the order\nso here we want to flip the order so we want to flip this condition right\nso we want to flip this condition right\nso we want to flip this condition right here\nhere\nhere and in order to flip\nand in order to flip\nand in order to flip we just need i believe to\nwe just need i believe to\nwe just need i believe to specify here n minus index\nspecify here n minus index\nspecify here n minus index multiplied by square size\nmultiplied by square size\nmultiplied by square size so\nso\nso or index minus n so let's reload we are\nor index minus n so let's reload we are\nor index minus n so let's reload we are going to figure it out\nso of course here we need the index\nso of course here we need the index minus n\nand the let's uh uh\nand the let's uh uh so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working nicely\nworking nicely\nworking nicely so uh here n minus index or index minus\nso uh here n minus index or index minus\nso uh here n minus index or index minus n is just to flick uh to fix this\nn is just to flick uh to fix this\nn is just to flick uh to fix this uh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the orientation\norientation\norientation so here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little bit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the width timing\nwidth timing\nwidth timing and let's reload\nand we can see in the end that the\nand we can see in the end that the animation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly so of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and over this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in order to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use another high order function that is\nanother high order function that is\nanother high order function that is called with repeat\ncalled with repeat\ncalled with repeat so let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the with repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function and here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want a number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1 so minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is equal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite repetitions\nrepetitions\nrepetitions so\nso\nso let's reload\nand let's see if everything is working\nand let's see if everything is working nicely\nso the first two rounds seems to works\nso the first two rounds seems to works just work fine\njust work fine\njust work fine but here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for the second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time we can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch here\nhere\nhere so\nso\nso we can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the width timing function\nwidth timing function\nwidth timing function so uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this opacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this opacity to\nopacity to\nopacity to improve the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we don't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation so let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final result\nso\nso here we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return this value right here\nthis value right here\nthis value right here and let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot

value\nthe rotate value\nthe rotate value is equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the rotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the

pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically

between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot

otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between

pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this

outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we

since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

making react native animations don't forget to subscribe to\nanimations don't forget to subscribe to\nanimations don't forget to subscribe to my channel to stay updated on my\nmy channel to stay updated on my\nmy channel to stay updated on my upcoming videos\nupcoming videos\nupcoming videos that said we can finally get our hands\nthat said we can finally get our hands\nthat said we can finally get our hands dirty and we can finally start to code\nso here we have a react native project\nso here we have a react native project initialized with the expo cli\ninitialized with the expo cli\ninitialized with the expo cli and of course with the typescript\nand of course with the typescript\nand of course with the typescript configuration\nconfiguration\nconfiguration in the package.json you can see that\nin the package.json you can see that\nin the package.json you can see that i've already installed just the\ni've already installed just the\ni've already installed just the reanimate package we are going to use a\nreanimate package we are going to use a\nreanimate package we are going to use a version above the 2.0\nversion above the 2.0\nversion above the 2.0 the

update the background color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black background color\nbackground color\nbackground color let's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get rid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text so here we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return this value right here\nthis value right here\nthis value right here and let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value so basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want that if\nthat if\nthat if the rotate value\nthe rotate value\nthe rotate value is equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the rotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square size\nto n multiplied by square size\nto n multiplied by square size so here let's add a minus just to be\nso here let's add a minus just to be\nso here let's add a minus just to be consistent with the\nconsistent with the\nconsistent with the with the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y and let's reload\nand let's reload\nand let's reload so i believe it was glitched\nso i believe it was glitched\nso i believe it was glitched and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working nicely let's just\nworking nicely let's just\nworking nicely let's just use here the with spring\nuse here the with spring\nuse here the with spring high order function\nhigh order function\nhigh order function and let's reload\nso we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working nicely\nnicely\nnicely so of course here here we are handling\nso of course here here we are handling\nso of course here here we are handling the first round the first rotation let's\nthe first round the first rotation let's\nthe first round the first rotation let's handle uh\nhandle uh\nhandle uh so the second rotation so we are going\nso the second rotation so we are going\nso the second rotation so we are going to animate the progress dot value until\nto animate the progress dot value until\nto animate the progress dot value until the value for a pi\nthe value for a pi\nthe value for a pi so if we load we can see that\nso if we load we can see that\nso if we load we can see that not everything is working at all\nnot everything is working at all\nnot everything is working at all and we need to find we need to handle\nand we need to find we need to handle\nand we need to find we need to handle the second rotation manually\nthe second rotation manually\nthe second rotation manually so let's start from the rotate\nso let's start from the rotate\nso let's start from the rotate the rotate derived value\nthe rotate derived value\nthe rotate derived value so we know that this condition right\nso we know that this condition right\nso we know that this condition right here\nhere\nhere is perfect but it is perfect when the\nis perfect but it is perfect when the\nis perfect but it is perfect when the progress dot value is less than

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each

be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto

let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot

progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value

otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso

but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is

working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also

since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

timing\nwidth timing\nwidth timing and let's reload\nand we can see in the end that the\nand we can see in the end that the animation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly so of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and over this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in order to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use another high order function that is\nanother high order function that is\nanother high order function that is called with repeat\ncalled with repeat\ncalled with repeat so let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the with repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function and here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want a number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1 so minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is equal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite repetitions\nrepetitions\nrepetitions so\nso\nso let's reload\nand let's see if everything is working\nand let's see if everything is working nicely\nso the first two rounds seems to works\nso the first two rounds seems to works just work fine\njust work fine\njust work fine but here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for the second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time we can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch here\nhere\nhere so\nso\nso we can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the width timing function\nwidth timing function\nwidth timing function so uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this opacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this opacity to\nopacity to\nopacity to improve the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we don't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation so let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final result\nso\nso here we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return this value right here\nthis value right here\nthis value right here and let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value so basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want that if\nthat if\nthat if the rotate value\nthe rotate value\nthe rotate value is equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the rotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square

the\nconsistent with the\nconsistent with the with the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y and let's reload\nand let's reload\nand let's reload so i believe it was glitched\nso i believe it was glitched\nso i believe it was glitched and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this

bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get rid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text so here we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot

need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the

between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot

otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between

pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is

quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be

changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

let's reload\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working almost nicely\nworking almost nicely\nworking almost nicely so uh\nso uh\nso uh what is happening right here and what do\nwhat is happening right here and what do\nwhat is happening right here and what do we so the rotation animation is working\nwe so the rotation animation is working\nwe so the rotation animation is working nicely but we need to fix this uh\nnicely but we need to fix this uh\nnicely but we need to fix this uh translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y animation and what what do we want to do\nanimation and what what do we want to do\nanimation and what what do we want to do we know that at the beginning the\nwe know that at the beginning the\nwe know that at the beginning the translate y we actually let's uh\ntranslate y we actually let's uh\ntranslate y we actually let's uh visualize these squares we know that at\nvisualize these squares we know that at\nvisualize these squares we know that at the beginning\nthe beginning\nthe beginning the last square is right here and the\nthe last square is right here and the\nthe last square is right here and the first\nfirst\nfirst the first square is like right here\nthe first square is like right here\nthe first square is like right here so if we run the animation\nso if we run the animation\nso if we run the animation we can see that we want to flip\nwe can see that we want to flip\nwe can see that we want to flip the order of these squares so we want\nthe order of these squares so we want\nthe order of these squares so we want that the last one\nthat the last one\nthat the last one became become the first one and the vice\nbecame become the first one and the vice\nbecame become the first one and the vice versa so as a friend of mine would say\nversa so as a friend of mine would say\nversa so as a friend of mine would say we want that the first will be last and\nwe want that the first will be last and\nwe want that the first will be last and the last will be first\nthe last will be first\nthe last will be first and in order to\nand in order to\nand in order to handle this kind of behavior\nhandle this kind of behavior\nhandle this kind of behavior we just need to fix here the translate\nwe just need to fix here the translate\nwe just need to fix here the translate why\nwhy\nwhy the translate y amount\nthe translate y amount\nthe translate y amount if the progress dot value is greater\nif the progress dot value is greater\nif the progress dot value is greater than 2 pi\nso here we want to flip the order\nso here we want to flip the order so we want to flip this condition right\nso we want to flip this condition right\nso we want to flip this condition right here\nhere\nhere and in order to flip\nand in order to flip\nand in order to flip we just need i believe to\nwe just need i believe to\nwe just need i believe to specify here n minus index\nspecify here n minus index\nspecify here n minus index multiplied by square size\nmultiplied by square size\nmultiplied by square size so\nso\nso or index minus n so let's reload we are\nor index minus n so let's reload we are\nor index minus n so let's reload we are going to figure it out\nso of course here we need the index\nso of course here we need the index minus n\nand the let's uh uh\nand the let's uh uh so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working nicely\nworking nicely\nworking nicely so uh here n minus index or index minus\nso uh here n minus index or index minus\nso uh here n minus index or index minus n is just to flick uh to fix this\nn is just to flick uh to fix this\nn is just to flick uh to fix this uh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the orientation\norientation\norientation so here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little bit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the width timing\nwidth timing\nwidth timing and let's reload\nand we can see in the end that the\nand we can see in the end that the animation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly so of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and over this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in order to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use another high order function that is\nanother high order function that is\nanother high order function that is called with repeat\ncalled with repeat\ncalled with repeat so let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the with repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function and here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want a number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1 so minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is equal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite repetitions\nrepetitions\nrepetitions so\nso\nso let's reload\nand let's see if everything is working\nand let's see if everything is working nicely\nso the first two rounds seems to works\nso the first two rounds seems to works just work fine\njust work fine\njust work fine but here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for the second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time we can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch here\nhere\nhere so\nso\nso we can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the width timing function\nwidth timing function\nwidth timing function so uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this opacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this opacity to\nopacity to\nopacity to improve the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we don't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation so let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final result\nso\nso here we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot

progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for

value\nthe rotate value\nthe rotate value is equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the rotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually

be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the

pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto

let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot

progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed

otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso

but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is

working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also

update the background color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black background color\nbackground color\nbackground color let's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get rid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text so here we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return this value right here\nthis value right here\nthis value right here and let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value so basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want that if\nthat if\nthat if the rotate value\nthe rotate value\nthe rotate value is equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the rotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square size\nto n multiplied by square size\nto n multiplied by square size so here let's add a minus just to be\nso here let's add a minus just to be\nso here let's add a minus just to be consistent with the\nconsistent with the\nconsistent with the with the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y and let's reload\nand let's reload\nand let's reload so i believe it was glitched\nso i believe it was glitched\nso i believe it was glitched and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working nicely let's just\nworking nicely let's just\nworking nicely let's just use here the with spring\nuse here the with spring\nuse here the with spring high order function\nhigh order function\nhigh order function and let's reload\nso we can see that everything is working\nso we can see that everything is working nicely\nnicely\nnicely so of course here here we are handling\nso of course here here we are handling\nso of course here here we are handling the first round the first rotation let's\nthe first round the first rotation let's\nthe first round the first rotation let's handle uh\nhandle uh\nhandle uh so the second rotation so we are going\nso the second rotation so we are going\nso the second rotation so we are going to animate the progress dot value

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a

specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a

square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each

say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because

be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto

working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also

n so let's reload we are going to figure it out\nso of course here we need the index\nso of course here we need the index minus n\nand the let's uh uh\nand the let's uh uh so let's see\nso let's see\nso let's see and we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working nicely\nworking nicely\nworking nicely so uh here n minus index or index minus\nso uh here n minus index or index minus\nso uh here n minus index or index minus n is just to flick uh to fix this\nn is just to flick uh to fix this\nn is just to flick uh to fix this uh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the orientation\norientation\norientation so here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little bit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the width timing\nwidth timing\nwidth timing and let's reload\nand we can see in the end that the\nand we can see in the end that the animation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly so of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and over this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in order to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use another high order function that is\nanother high order function that is\nanother high order function that is called with repeat\ncalled with repeat\ncalled with repeat so let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with timing with the with repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function\nwith repeat high order function and here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want a number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1 so minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is equal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite repetitions\nrepetitions\nrepetitions so\nso\nso let's reload\nand let's see if everything is working\nand let's see if everything is working nicely\nso the first two rounds seems to works\nso the first two rounds seems to works just work fine\njust work fine\njust work fine but here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for the second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time\nthe second time and for the third time we can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch\nwe can see that there is a little glitch here\nhere\nhere so\nso\nso we can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the width timing function\nwidth timing function\nwidth timing function so uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this opacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this opacity to\nopacity to\nopacity to improve the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we don't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation so let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final result\nso\nso here we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is\nhere we can see that everything is working perfectly\nworking

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return this value right here\nthis value right here\nthis value right here and let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot

animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional

index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright

pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the

otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this

outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

package.json you can see that\nin the package.json you can see that\nin the package.json you can see that i've already installed just the\ni've already installed just the\ni've already installed just the reanimate package we are going to use a\nreanimate package we are going to use a\nreanimate package we are going to use a version above the 2.0\nversion above the 2.0\nversion above the 2.0 the 2.0 version and don't forget to add\nthe 2.0 version and don't forget to add\nthe 2.0 version and don't forget to add the react native reanimated plugin\nthe react native reanimated plugin\nthe react native reanimated plugin inside the bubble config.js in order to\ninside the bubble config.js in order to\ninside the bubble config.js in order to complete the reanimated installation\ncomplete the reanimated installation\ncomplete the reanimated installation process\nprocess\nprocess so that said we can start to update the\nso that said we can start to update the\nso that said we can start to update the background color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black\nbackground color so let's use a black background color\nbackground color\nbackground color let's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get\nlet's fix the status bar and let's get rid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text\nrid of this of the of the text so here we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value\nwith just accessing the index value so here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view\nso here let's return a view and this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the

pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot

progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this

bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's

let's reload\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working almost nicely\nworking almost nicely\nworking almost nicely so uh\nso uh\nso uh what is happening right here and what do\nwhat is happening right here and what do\nwhat is happening right here and what do we so the rotation animation is working\nwe so the rotation animation is working\nwe so the rotation animation is working nicely but we need to fix this uh\nnicely but we need to fix this uh\nnicely but we need to fix this uh translate y\ntranslate y\ntranslate y animation and what what do we want to

sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the\nuh sign that we have right here so the orientation\norientation\norientation so here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little\nso here in order to uh smooth a little bit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the\nbit the animation let's just use the width timing\nwidth timing\nwidth timing and let's reload\nand we can see in the end that the\nand we can see in the end that the animation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly\nanimation is working perfectly so of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and\nso of course we want to repeat over and over this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in\nover this beautiful animation and in order to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use\norder to do it we are going to use another high order function that is\nanother high order function that is\nanother high order function that is called with repeat\ncalled with repeat\ncalled with repeat so let's wrap this with timing with the\nso let's wrap this with

let's specify that we want\nand here let's specify that we want a number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1\na number of repetition equal to minus 1 so minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is\nso minus 1 is equal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite\nequal to infinite we want infinite repetitions\nrepetitions\nrepetitions so\nso\nso let's reload\nand let's see if everything is working\nand let's see if everything is working nicely\nso the first two rounds seems to works\nso the first two rounds seems to works just work fine\njust work fine\njust work fine but here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for\nbut here when the animation repeat for the second time and for the third time\nthe second time and

so\nso\nso we can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the\nwe can fix this behavior by adding the width timing function\nwidth timing function\nwidth timing function so uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this\nso uh in the end we can also remove this opacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this\nopacity since we have just used this opacity to\nopacity to\nopacity to improve the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we\nimprove the developer experience but we don't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation\ndon't need it in the final animation so let's reload and we can see the final\nso let's reload and we can see the final\nso

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the index\nso\nso here we can\nhere we can\nhere we can import to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we\nimport to the square component that we have defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid in order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these\nin order to flip vertically these these squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus\nthese squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto do it\nto do it let's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app\nlet's define outside inside the app component\ncomponent\ncomponent a progress shared value\nand let's\nand let's animate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from\nanimate inside a use effect hook from react\nreact\nreact this progress\nthis progress\nthis progress dot\ndot\ndot value\nvalue\nvalue so we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing\nso we are going to use a width timing function in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the\nfunction in order to animate the progress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi\nprogress until the value to pi so in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation\nso in order to complete a full rotation and let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration\nand let's specify here the duration equal to 4 seconds\nso this progress this shared value this\nso this progress this shared value this progress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed\nprogress shared value needs to be passed inside this square\ninside this square\ninside this square and we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the\nand we are going to access the um the progress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square\nprogress shared value inside each square so of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the\nso of course we need to define the shared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square\nshared value outside each square otherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12\notherwise we are going to create 12 different shared values\ndifferent shared values\ndifferent shared values so let's\nso let's\nso let's so here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for\nso here we need to specify for typescript the\ntypescript the\ntypescript the progress type\nprogress type\nprogress type so progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated\nso progress will be an animated animated from reanimated\nfrom reanimated\nfrom reanimated shared value of type number\nshared value of type number\nshared value of type number and here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress\nand here let's access the progress so\nso\nso so for now we can\nso for now we can\nso for now we can animate\nanimate\nanimate so let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style\nso let's define the reanimated style with the use animated style\nwith the use animated style\nwith the use animated style and let's return\nand let's return\nand let's return let's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation\nlet's just copy this transform operation right here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the\nright here and let's paste inside the rear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate\nrear animated style in order to animate this view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an\nthis view we need of course to use an animated view\nanimated view\nanimated view and we can pass\nand we can pass\nand we can pass the reanimated style\nso\nso of course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's\nof course nothing is working and that's because we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um\nbecause we need to pass here our um our shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see\nour shared value let's see and basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each\nand basically we want that for each square the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the\nsquare the rotation is equal to the minimum\nminimum\nminimum between the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress\nbetween the final angle and the progress dot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will\ndot value so the progress dot value will be animated\nbe animated\nbe animated from value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi\nfrom value 0 to value to pi and\nand\nand if the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the\nif the progress value is less than the final angle\nfinal angle\nfinal angle we should\nwe should\nwe should we must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to\nwe must animate otherwise we need to keep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle\nkeep the current final angle so we can\nso we can\nso we can see that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the\nsee that a rotate should be equal to the minimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the\nminimum between the final angle and the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate\nand we can pass here the rotate parameter\nand we can see that everything is\nand we can see that everything is working smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look\nworking smoothly but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is quadratic and we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things\nand we need to fix here these things so by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing\nso by default inside the width timing function and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be\nfunction and these single will be quadratic\nquadratic\nquadratic so let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated\nso let's import easing from reanimated and let's force it to be linear\nso everything is working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to animate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um\nanimate the translation and the um translate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based\ntranslate the shared value will be based on this rotation\non this rotation\non this rotation on the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter\non the on the this rotation parameter so in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation\nso in order to animate the translation let's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code\nlet's refactor a little bit this code we just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate\nwe just want to keep this rotate parameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated\nparameter outside this use animated style\nstyle\nstyle but a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and\nbut a code like that will not work and it will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress.\nit will not work since the progress. since the rotate\nsince the rotate\nsince the rotate parameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed\nparameter needs to be recomputed every time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value\nevery time that the progress dot value changes\nchanges\nchanges so in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need\nso in order to fix this behavior we need to derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the\nto derive the rotate value based on the progress dot value\nprogress dot value\nprogress dot value and we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that\nand we can we can do that just by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook\njust by using the use derived the hook from react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated\nfrom react natively animated so of course\nso of course\nso of course normally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but\nnormally this statement will work but since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a derived the used arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook\nused arrived value hook so let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement\nso let's return this statement and let's say here rotate dot value\nso right now we can define the translate\nso right now we can define the translate y\ny\ny and we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based\nand we can derive the translate y based on the rotate\non the rotate\non the rotate derived value\nderived value\nderived value so for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return\nso for now let's just return this value right here\nthis value right here\nthis value right here and let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value\nand let's say here translate y dot value so basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want\nso basically what do we want we want that if\nthat if\nthat if the rotate value\nthe rotate value\nthe rotate value is equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the\nis equal to the final angle so if the rotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed\nrotate animation is completed we want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches\nwe want that the translate y stretches until the\nuntil the\nuntil the radius amount\nradius amount\nradius amount and the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal\nand the radius amount is basically equal to n multiplied by square size\nto n multiplied by square size\nto n multiplied by square size so here let's add a minus just to be\nso here let's add a minus just to be\nso here let's add a minus just to be consistent with the\nconsistent with the\nconsistent with the with the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y\nwith the previous uh my translate y and let's reload\nand let's reload\nand

we are going to\nso here we are going to\nso here we are going to we are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different\nwe are going to display 12 different squares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these\nsquares and in order to display these squares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill\nsquares we are just going to fill a dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map\na dummy array and we are going to map this array\nthis array\nthis array with just accessing the index value\nwith just

view right here would be our\nand this view right here would be our square\nsquare\nsquare so of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key\nso of course we need to specify the key property\nproperty\nproperty and we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style\nand we need to pass here the style so each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal\nso each square will have a height equal to 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say\nto 12 a width equal to 12 so let's say aspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one\naspect ratio equal to one a background color\na background color\na background color equal to white\nand it is fine like that\nand it is fine like that so um\nso um\nso um here we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in\nhere we have 12 different squares in order to\norder to\norder to visualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square\nvisualize individually each square let's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity\nlet's actually update this opacity so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say opacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12\nopacity equal to index divided by 12 since we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares\nsince we have 12 different squares so um\nso um\nso um here we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and\nhere we can see just 11 squares and that's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have\nthat's because the first one will have index equal to zero\nindex equal to zero\nindex equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's\nso in order to fix this behavior let's just say index plus one\njust say index plus one\njust say index plus one and we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square\nand we can see here the first square so um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different\nso um here we have a lot of different constants\nconstants\nconstants so that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little\nso that let's try to refactor a little bit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific\nbit this constants inside a specific file\nso let's define here the n constant so\nso let's define here the n constant so the amount of squares\nthe amount of squares\nthe amount of squares and let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size\nand let's define the square size that's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12.\nthat's casually is equal to 12. so let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant\nso let's import here the n constant here it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be\nhere it will be n and here it will be the square size\nthe square size\nthe square size so um\nso um\nso um at this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working\nat this point everything is working nicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little\nnicely but we need to refactor a little bit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going\nbit this component so since we are going to to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this\nto to do a lot of stuff with this component right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a\ncomponent right here let's create a components folder\ncomponents folder\ncomponents folder and let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file\nand let's create a square tsx file so here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a\nso here we are going to define a react native functional component\nand let's copy\nand let's copy this code right here\nso uh we need to access the square size\nso uh we need to access the square size we need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant\nwe need to access the end constant and we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index\nand we need to access the index parameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square\nparameter so let's define the square props\nprops\nprops let's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index\nlet's specify here the index and the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native\nand the square will be a react native functional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function\nfunctional component a react function component actually\ncomponent actually\ncomponent actually with these square props\nwith these square props\nwith these square props so let's access here\nso let's access here\nso let's access here the

pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key\nhave defined and we need to pass the key equal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index\nequal to index and the index actually\nactually\nactually there is\nthere is\nthere is an issue\nan issue\nan issue so we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course\nso we need to import of course and let's say index equal to index\nand we are good to go\nand we are good to go so\nso\nso here we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but\nhere we have our 12 squares but in order to\nin order to\nin order to so we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually\nso we are going to animate individually each square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much\neach square and in order to have much control over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is\ncontrol over the individual square it is better to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to\nbetter to define the position equal to absolute\nabsolute\nabsolute so we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the\nso we are going to update later the rotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation\nrotation and the translation based on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute\nbased on the position absolute so for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the\nso for now let's also fix right now the translation\ntranslation\ntranslation so let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y\nso let's specify the translate y parameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be\nparameter and the translate y will be equal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size\nequal to index multiplied by square size so uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to avoid\nso uh in order to

squares let's just add the minus sign\nsign\nsign and here we go\nand here we go\nand here we go so\nso\nso right now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh\nright now we are going to animate the uh the rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but\nthe rotation and the translation but let's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's\nlet's start from the rotation and let's start to\nstart to\nstart to see actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final\nsee actually how it should be the final angle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square\nangle of each individual square so um\nso um\nso um basically\nbasically\nbasically when the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed\nwhen the animation will be completed each square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the\neach square will be positioned with the the same distance\nthe same distance\nthe same distance so the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares\nso the distance between each squares will be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical\nwill be equal will be identical and this offset\nand this offset\nand this offset this offset angle\nthis offset angle\nthis offset angle will be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi\nwill be equal to 2 pi divided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and\ndivided by n since we have n squares and 2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation\n2 pi is just the full rotation so the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course\nso the final angle will be of course proportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset\nproportional to this offset so let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by\nso let's say offset angle multiplied by index\nindex\nindex so a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index\nso a y multiplied by index so actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't\nso actually this final angle isn't correct but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an\ncorrect but i want just to uh decide an angle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the\nangle based on the on the square index uh\nsquare index uh\nsquare index uh so with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are\nso with this kind of uh statement we are just defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is\njust defining a final angle that is proportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and\nproportional to the offset angle and proportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the\nproportional to this to the index the final angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different\nfinal angle of course will be different for each individual square\nfor each individual square\nfor each individual square so let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this\nso let's uh let's apply actually this rotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen\nrotation and let's see what will happen so let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle\nso let's say final angle and radians\nand radians\nand radians so here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting\nso here that's not what we are expecting and that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array\nand that's because this transform array needs to uh\nneeds to uh\nneeds to uh needs to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first\nneeds to prioritize the rotation first so uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of\nso uh inside the transform array of course the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action\ncourse the order of each um each action is a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first\nis a really important so we need first to apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation\nto apply the rotation so uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that\nso uh it seems actually that this angle is correct\nthis angle is correct\nthis angle is correct but it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that\nbut it isn't since we want that this square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last\nthis square right here that is the last square since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has\nsquare since the first one has the uh\nthe uh\nthe uh less opacity\nless opacity\nless opacity we want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is\nwe want that this square right here is on top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want\non top is right right here so we want that the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the\nthat the rotation the final angle of the last square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n\nlast square that will be the square n minus one\nminus one\nminus one has the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero\nhas the final angle equal to zero so in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just\nso in order to fix this behavior we just need to say that\nneed to say that\nneed to say that n minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index\nn minus 1 minus index so we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus\nso we just need to add n minus 1 minus index\nindex\nindex since we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal\nsince we want that if the index is equal to n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be\nto n minus 1 this final angle should be equal to zero\nequal to zero\nequal to zero and we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine\nand we can see that everything is fine so um\nso um\nso um for now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to\nfor now we can actually start to animating this uh\nanimating this uh\nanimating this uh the the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order\nthe the rotation processor and in order to do it\nto

but uh so if you look closely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation\nclosely you can see that the animation is not linear it is quadratic\nis not linear it is

working nicely\nso everything is working nicely so\nso\nso of course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the\nof course we need also to animate the translation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to\ntranslation so we don't need just to animate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also to\nanimate the rotation we need also

since the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared\nsince the progress dot value is a shared value we are forced to use a derived the\nvalue we are forced to use a

you're going to see that in the react\nyou're going to see that in the react\nyou're going to see that in the react native reanimated Ducks there are now\nnative reanimated Ducks there are now\nnative reanimated Ducks there are now two new sections about CSS Transitions\ntwo new sections about CSS Transitions\ntwo new sections about CSS Transitions and CSS animations um they all contain\nand CSS animations um they all contain\nand CSS animations um they all contain some nice examples that you can easily\nsome nice examples that you can easily\nsome nice examples that you can easily bring into an application and and we're\nbring into an application and and we're\nbring into an application and and we're going to just see a few of them in\ngoing to just see a few of them in\ngoing to just see a few of them in action so in my code um I got started by\naction so in my code um I got started by\naction so in my code um I got started by adding a simple animated view um I will\nadding a simple animated view um I will\nadding a simple animated view um I will get usually like these red lines here\nget usually like these red lines here\nget usually like these red lines here because something isn't working entirely\nbecause something isn't working entirely\nbecause something isn't working entirely yet with like uh the types however if we\nyet with like uh the types however if we\nyet with like uh the types however if we look at this uh we just have a simple\nlook at this uh we just have a simple\nlook at this uh we just have a simple box here with some background color and\nbox here with some background color and\nbox here with some background color and if I click a button we can easily expand\nif I click a button we can easily expand\nif I click a button we can easily expand this so um this red stuff makes it kind\nthis so um this red stuff makes it kind\nthis so um this red stuff makes it kind of hard to read you see that we got a\nof hard to read you see that we got a\nof hard to read you see that we got a transition property and transition\ntransition property and transition\ntransition property and transition duration in here now um so that means\nduration in here now um so that means\nduration in here now um so that means you don't really need to use reanimated\nyou don't really need to use reanimated\nyou don't really need to use reanimated like shared values all the time uh which\nlike shared values all the time uh which\nlike shared values all the time uh which can like make some animations really\ncan like make some animations really\ncan like make some animations really hard to set up for this easy stuff you\nhard to set up for this easy stuff you\nhard to set up for this easy stuff you can really just use CSS animations and\ncan really just use CSS animations and\ncan really just use CSS animations and let's bring in another one like this one\nlet's bring in another one like this one\nlet's bring in another one like this one here so really cool pulse animations and\nhere so really cool pulse animations and\nhere so really cool pulse animations and this is honestly just the beginning I\nthis is honestly just the beginning I\nthis is honestly just the beginning I hear everyone oh these are so the basic\nhear everyone oh these are so the basic\nhear everyone oh these are so the basic examples yeah I know but still these\nexamples yeah I know but still these\nexamples yeah I know but still these basic examples show what's General\nbasic examples show what's General\nbasic examples show what's General possible uh only problem here again is\npossible uh only problem here again is\npossible uh only problem here again is that my IDE doesn't really understand\nthat my IDE doesn't really understand\nthat my IDE doesn't really understand that these things are now available to\nthat these things are now available to\nthat these things are now available to our animated view so if you give this a\nour animated view so if you give this a\nour animated view so if you give this a try make sure you're using an animated\ntry make sure you're using an animated\ntry make sure you're using an animated View and then you can apply this to your\nView and then you can apply this to your\nView and then you can apply this to your styling now these are really basic\nstyling now these are really basic\nstyling now these are really basic things but I found some pretty cool\nthings but I found some pretty cool\nthings but I found some pretty cool examples in uh both the um react native\nexamples in uh both the um react native\nexamples in uh both the um react native reanimated documentation so for everyone\nreanimated documentation so for everyone\nreanimated documentation so for everyone if you want to try this out go into the\nif you want to try this out go into the\nif you want to try this out go into the react native reanimated make sure you're\nreact native reanimated make sure you're\nreact native reanimated make sure you're on the beater and then go to apps uh I\non the beater and then go to apps uh I\non the beater and then go to apps uh I think it's under I hope it's under\nthink it's under

whatever you prefer screens\nexamples whatever you prefer screens real world okay at this point you\nreal world okay at this point you\nreal world okay at this point you finally arrived probably somewhere here\nfinally arrived probably somewhere here\nfinally arrived probably somewhere here uh and then you can take a look at their\nuh and then you can take a look at their\nuh and then you can take a look at their examples which are way closer and I\nexamples which are way closer and I\nexamples which are way closer and I brought some of them in and I also found\nbrought some of them in and I also found\nbrought some of them in and I also found uh this tweet from Kristof uh who also\nuh this tweet from Kristof uh who also\nuh this tweet from Kristof uh who also shared a couple of examples here for\nshared a couple of examples here for\nshared a couple of examples here for simple button components you also shared\nsimple button components you also shared\nsimple button components you also shared these uh straight um from a GitHub link\nthese uh straight um from a GitHub link\nthese uh straight um from a GitHub link so that's pretty nice and I use them as\nso that's pretty nice and I use them as\nso that's pretty nice and I use them as well let's see if they work so I created\nwell let's see if they work so I created\nwell let's see if they work so I created this glow button component uh and we got\nthis glow button component uh and we got\nthis glow button component uh and we got this nice glowing button up here and if\nthis nice glowing button up here and if\nthis nice glowing button up here and if we check out the code it's pretty\nwe check out the code it's pretty\nwe check out the code it's pretty straightforward like this is a button\nstraightforward like this is a button\nstraightforward like this is a button there's a bit going on and pressable and\nthere's a bit going on and pressable and\nthere's a bit going on and pressable and the cool and interesting thing is now\nthe cool and interesting thing is now\nthe cool and interesting thing is now that you can import CSS from react\nthat you can import CSS from react\nthat you can import CSS from react native reanimated and pretty much use it\nnative reanimated and pretty much use it\nnative reanimated and pretty much use it like a replacement for stylesheet to\nlike a replacement for stylesheet to\nlike a replacement for stylesheet to create your CSS animations which will\ncreate your CSS animations which will\ncreate your CSS animations which will enable this this is really super\nenable this this is really super\nenable this this is really super interesting I got again the same issue\ninteresting I got again the same issue\ninteresting I got again the same issue like before something with the types\nlike before something with the types\nlike before something with the types going on but we got a couple of examples\ngoing on but we got a couple of examples\ngoing on but we got a couple of examples pretty of basic examples let's take a\npretty of basic examples let's take a\npretty of basic examples let's take a look at something a bit more so I also\nlook at something a bit more so I also\nlook at something a bit more so I also found this campfire example and again it\nfound this campfire example and again it\nfound this campfire example and again it just works like it works completely\njust works like it works completely\njust works like it works completely without any problems uh I just had to\nwithout any problems uh I just had to\nwithout any problems uh I just had to make tiny changes from the repository to\nmake tiny changes from the repository to\nmake tiny changes from the repository to make this work but but overall it's\nmake this work but but overall it's\nmake this work but but overall it's really not hard if you're coming from\nreally not hard if you're coming from\nreally not hard if you're coming from the web you can just Define them with\nthe web you can just Define them with\nthe web you can just Define them with css. key frames and you have your\ncss. key frames and you have your\ncss. key frames and you have your animation super tidy and nicely defined\nanimation super tidy and nicely defined\nanimation super tidy and nicely defined here in your react native application\nhere in your react native application\nhere in your react native application really this is amazing and you get super\nreally this is amazing and you get super\nreally this is amazing and you get super cool things you can even that like this\ncool things you can even that like this\ncool things you can even that like this space view I brought in um just looking\nspace view I brought in um just looking\nspace view I brought in um just looking at this I just need this in my own\nat this I just need this in my own\nat this I just need this in my own applications because it's it's it's so\napplications because it's it's it's so\napplications because it's it's it's so cool and they said in the documentation\ncool and they said in the documentation\ncool and they said in the documentation that you can pretty much bring in uh any\nthat you can pretty much bring in uh any\nthat you can pretty much bring in uh any sort of code you find on code pen uh\nsort of code you find on code pen uh\nsort of code you find on code pen uh which you defin Ely can if you're\nwhich you defin Ely can if you're\nwhich you defin Ely can if you're skilled however I had some issues for\nskilled however I had some issues for\nskilled however I had some issues for example this was the example I gave um\nexample this was the example I gave um\nexample this was the example I gave um if I copy this code and use it in the\nif I copy this code and use it in the\nif I copy this code and use it in the new react native CSS translator tool\nnew react native CSS translator tool\nnew react native CSS translator tool they also introduced here um it's not\nthey also introduced here um it's not\nthey also introduced here um it's not really working and I think this is\nreally working and I think this is\nreally working and I think this is probably because I'm an idiot and I\nprobably because I'm an idiot and I\nprobably because I'm an idiot and I don't know how to use these things I\ndon't know how to use these things I\ndon't know how to use these things I already tried to resolve the cess\nalready tried to resolve the cess\nalready tried to resolve the cess variables to like the other stuff but\nvariables to like the other stuff but\nvariables to like the other stuff but then still all these like and pido\nthen still all these like and pido\nthen still all these like and pido elements are not working for me and then\nelements are not working for me and then\nelements are not working for me and then I gave up and I was like yeah well\nI gave up and I was like yeah well\nI gave up and I was like yeah well whatever ever uh I mean it would be\nwhatever ever uh I mean it would be\nwhatever ever uh I mean it would be really cool to get these kinds of\nreally cool to get these kinds of\nreally cool to get these kinds of animations simply converted into react\nanimations simply converted into react\nanimations simply converted into react native application and I think we're not\nnative application and I think we're not\nnative application and I think we're not very far off from that point so one\nvery far off from that point so one\nvery far off from that point so one thing I just want to point out here as\nthing I just want to point out here as\nthing I just want to point out here as well is that what you see in this view\nwell is that what you see in this view\nwell is that what you see in this view here or in the in the campfire view this\nhere or in the in the campfire view this\nhere or in the in the campfire view this is really native stuff so I've been\nis really native stuff so I've been\nis really native stuff so I've been running this through xcode and if I now\nrunning this through xcode and if I now\nrunning this through xcode and if I now pause my debuger here and say debug view\npause my debuger here and say debug view\npause my debuger here and say debug view debugging capture view hierarchy you can\ndebugging capture view hierarchy you can\ndebugging capture view hierarchy you can see that these things they are native\nsee that these things they are native\nsee that these things they are native views they are native iOS views so react\nviews they are native iOS views so react\nviews they are native iOS views so react native always renders to these native\nnative always renders to these native\nnative always renders to these native elements and that's the great thing here\nelements and that's the great thing here\nelements and that's the great thing here even though these are CSS animations\neven though these are CSS animations\neven though these are CSS animations reanimator will make sure they run uh in\nreanimator will make sure they run uh in\nreanimator will make sure they run uh in the most performant way in IOS and\nthe most performant way in IOS and\nthe most performant way in IOS and Android and of course their CSS\nAndroid and of course their CSS\nAndroid and of course their CSS animations they will of course work on\nanimations they will of course work on\nanimations they will of course work on the web just as fine as well so super\nthe web just as fine as well so super\nthe web just as fine as well so super performant on the web as well here with\nperformant on the web as well here with\nperformant on the web as well here with Expo web no problem at all with my\nExpo web no problem at all with my\nExpo web no problem at all with my application this was also my more than\napplication this was also my more than\napplication this was also my more than poor attempt to create my own animation\npoor attempt to create my own animation\npoor attempt to create my own animation using some code pen examples and then\nusing some code pen examples and then\nusing some code pen examples and then transforming this it's not too hard I'm\ntransforming this it's not too hard I'm\ntransforming this it's not too hard I'm just not really good with the stuff but\njust not really good with the stuff but\njust not really good with the stuff but I think smart people will create even\nI think smart people will create even\nI think smart people will create even better things in the future now there\nbetter things in the future now there\nbetter things in the future now there are a few things I wanted to point out\nare a few things I wanted to point out\nare a few things I wanted to point out based on uh this again on the notes that\nbased on uh this again on the notes that\nbased on uh this again on the notes that you should definitely read through so\nyou should definitely read through so\nyou should definitely read through so they are incredible um but CSS\nthey are incredible um but CSS\nthey are incredible um but CSS animations are are not for every\nanimations are are not for every\nanimations are are not for every scenario so they rely on a fire and\nscenario so they rely on a fire and\nscenario so they rely on a fire and forget model which mean they cannot\nforget model which mean they cannot\nforget model which mean they cannot respond to the dynamic external factors\nrespond to the dynamic external factors\nrespond to the dynamic external factors in real time that means that the other\nin real time that means that the other\nin real time that means that the other parts of reanimated the shared values\nparts of reanimated the shared values\nparts of reanimated the shared values and the worklets you define are still\nand the worklets you define are still\nand the worklets you define are still super powerful and will continue to be\nsuper powerful and will continue to be\nsuper powerful and will continue to be powerful in the future that uh really\npowerful in the future that uh really\npowerful in the future that uh really means CSS is a new way for web\nmeans CSS is a new way for web\nmeans CSS is a new way for web developers and like for every react\ndevelopers and like for every react\ndevelopers and like for every react native developer to easily add\nnative developer to easily add\nnative developer to easily add animations however they're not for every\nanimations however they're not for every\nanimations however they're not for every scenario and also what I said in the\nscenario and also what I said in the\nscenario and also what I said in the beginning the API might change because\nbeginning the API might change because\nbeginning the API might change because well it's a beta and um they plan to\nwell it's a beta and um they plan to\nwell it's a beta and um they plan to restructure the main repository as far\nrestructure the main repository as far\nrestructure the main repository as far as I know down here so uh there will be\nas I know down here so uh there will be\nas I know down here so uh there will be a new order some things will be like in\na new order some things will be like in\na new order some things will be like in different packages but anyway you can\ndifferent packages but anyway you can\ndifferent packages but anyway you can already try this out today and I think\nalready try this out today and I think\nalready try this out today and I think it's a super interesting approach this\nit's a super interesting approach this\nit's a super interesting approach this completely fits into the current picture\ncompletely fits into the current picture\ncompletely fits into the current picture and theme of react native where\nand theme of react native where\nand theme of react native where everything is like Universal but I think\neverything is like Universal but I think\neverything is like Universal but I think it's also interesting to point out that\nit's also interesting to point out that\nit's also interesting to point out that while we got like on the one hand we got\nwhile we got like on the one hand we got\nwhile we got like on the one hand we got things as reanimated 4 with CSS we got\nthings as reanimated 4 with CSS we got\nthings as reanimated 4 with CSS we got native wind which allows you to use\nnative wind which allows you to use\nnative wind which allows you to use Tailwind CSS uh in your application and\nTailwind CSS uh in your application and\nTailwind CSS uh in your application and also all the latest react native\nalso all the latest react native\nalso all the latest react native versions like just the latest\nversions like just the latest\nversions like just the latest 0.77 have a new property related to CSS\n0.77 have a new property related to CSS\n0.77 have a new property related to CSS styling we just like with the last\nstyling we just like with the last\nstyling we just like with the last version got box Shadow working on\nversion got box Shadow working on\nversion got box Shadow working on Android and iOS so all of these things\nAndroid and iOS so all of these things\nAndroid and iOS so all of these things bring us closer to the web and it makes\nbring us closer to the web and it makes\nbring us closer to the web and it makes it easier for web developers to\nit easier for web developers to\nit easier for web developers to transition to react native on the other\ntransition to react native on the other\ntransition to react native on the other hand we also have things like the Expo\nhand we also have things like the Expo\nhand we also have things like the Expo Apple Target that Evan bacon was working\nApple Target that Evan bacon was working\nApple Target that Evan bacon was working on which really allows like deep\non which really allows like deep\non which really allows like deep integration in creating widget with\nintegration in creating widget with\nintegration in creating widget with swift um or we got the Expo modules in\nswift um or we got the Expo modules in\nswift um or we got the Expo modules in general which makes it really easy to\ngeneral which makes it really easy to\ngeneral which makes it really easy to expose Swift or cotlin functionality to\nexpose Swift or cotlin functionality to\nexpose Swift or cotlin functionality to react native so we really got like these\nreact native so we really got like these\nreact native so we really got like these two dimensions of making it easier and\ntwo dimensions of making it easier and\ntwo dimensions of making it easier and aligning it with the web and on the\naligning it with the web and on the\naligning it

start by\nthis simple BMI app so let's start by diving into this JS code as we go and as\ndiving into this JS code as we go and as\ndiving into this JS code as we go and as I talk to them I'm going to pull out the\nI talk to them I'm going to pull out the\nI talk to them I'm going to pull out the most important parts first we have two\nmost important parts first we have two\nmost important parts first we have two shared values weight and height out here\nshared values weight and height out here\nshared values weight and height out here so first thing I'm going to do is pull\nso first thing

now ready to go or almost so the other thing that\nto go or almost so the other thing that\nto go or almost so the other thing that needs to happen is that these worklets\nneeds to happen is that these worklets\nneeds to happen is that these worklets need to be registered with reanimated so\nneed to be registered with reanimated so\nneed to be registered with reanimated so that they can be

the\ncharting the dependencies the relationships between these different\nrelationships between these different\nrelationships between these different values is constructed so let's do that\nvalues is constructed so let's do that\nvalues is constructed so let's do that now we're going to start with our shared\nnow we're going to start with our shared\nnow we're going to start with our shared values so we\nvalues so we\nvalues so we have weight\nhave weight\nhave weight here and we have height now they're not\nhere and we have height now they're not\nhere and we have height now they're not dependent on anything they're\ndependent on anything they're\ndependent on anything they're independent nodes in the\nindependent nodes in the\nindependent nodes in the graph and then we have our first derived\ngraph and then we have our first derived\ngraph and then we have our first derived value so BMI that is calculated using\nvalue so BMI that is calculated using\nvalue so BMI that is calculated using both the\nboth the\nboth the height and the\nheight and the\nheight and the weight and then we have our animated\nweight and then we have our animated\nweight and then we have our

after the dependency graph has\nstyle after the dependency graph has\nstyle after the dependency graph has been constructed we have the initial\nbeen constructed we have the initial\nbeen constructed we have the initial execution of our\nexecution of our\nexecution of our worklets so uh for BMI I believe the\nworklets so uh for BMI I believe the\nworklets so uh for BMI I believe the initial value is something like\ninitial value is something like\ninitial value is something like 23.5 BMI text we have an object which\n23.5 BMI text we have an object which\n23.5 BMI text we have an object which ultimately boils down to\nultimately boils down to\nultimately boils down to 23.5 and then the VIS style is a more\n23.5 and then the VIS style is a more\n23.5 and then the VIS style is a more

for example for color red we're going to\nfor example for color red we're going to\nfor example for color red we're going to do text red\ndo text red\ndo text red 500 and for font size 30 we're going to\n500 and for font size 30 we're going to\n500 and for font size 30 we're going to do text X or free\ndo text X or free\ndo text X or free Excel and now we no longer need the\nExcel and now we no

yes that's exactly how it uh\nthan bigger yes that's exactly how it uh\nthan bigger yes that's exactly how it uh it happens\nit happens\nit happens so in the\nso in the\nso in the background it sets the image of the\nbackground it sets the image of the\nbackground it sets the image of the currently visible item here and then it\ncurrently visible item here and then it\ncurrently visible item here and then it puts a blur on top of it and that's how\nputs a blur on top of it and that's how\nputs a blur on top of it and that's how it achieves this view so let's try to do\nit achieves this view so

enough contrast what I will\nthere is not enough contrast what I will\nthere is not enough contrast what I will do is I will also render on top of a\ndo is I will also render on top of a\ndo is I will also render on top of a image a\nimage a\nimage a view that is going to serve as um\nview that is going to serve as um\nview that is going to serve as um as a overlay so the class name of that\nas a

with bottom zero and so one to\nabsolute with bottom zero and so one to take it the whole screen and the\ntake it the whole screen and the\ntake it the whole screen and the background if I do background black it's\nbackground if I do background black it's\nbackground if I do background black it's going to be black and we no longer see\ngoing to be black and we no longer see\ngoing to be

it's too the background is too too\nout it's too the background is too too\nout it's too the background is too too light if I put it it darkens it a little\nlight if I put it it darkens it a

you very\nmuch okay I think now it looks better if\nmuch okay I think now it looks better if you have suggestions on how I can do it\nyou have suggestions on how I can do it\nyou have suggestions on

know\ngray I'm not a designer and don't know exactly like what's going going to be\nexactly like what's going going to be\nexactly like what's going going to be the effect of all of this uh so gray\nthe effect of all of this uh so gray\nthe effect of all of this uh so gray actually makes if it's a very light gray\nactually makes if it's a very light gray\nactually makes if it's a very light gray it's going to make it more closer to\nit's going to make it more closer to\nit's going to make it more closer to White if it's 800 which is a darker gray\nWhite if it's 800 which is a darker gray\nWhite if it's 800 which is a darker gray it's probably better if it's full black\nit's probably better if it's full black\nit's probably better if it's full black it's the different situation but I think\nit's the different situation but I think\nit's the different situation but I think black is kind of good maybe 60 or\nblack is kind of good maybe 60 or\nblack is kind of good maybe 60 or 70 or 70 is too much maybe I will leave\n70 or 70 is too much maybe I will leave\n70 or 70 is too much maybe I will leave it to 50\nperfect I don't know there is way more\nperfect I don't know there is way more color here but maybe even it's because\ncolor here but maybe even it's because\ncolor here but maybe even it's because of the images\nyou um Now quickly I want to experiment\nyou um Now quickly I want to experiment with seeing how I can swap the\nwith seeing how I can swap the\nwith seeing how I can swap the backgrounds even if I'm not going to\nbackgrounds even if I'm not going

about how\nyou um think a little bit about how would\nwould\nwould you change the image like in an animated\nyou change the image like in an animated\nyou change the image like in an animated way like going from one to another like\nway like going from one to another like\nway like going from one to another like with a fade\nwith a fade\nwith a fade animation not like\nanimation not like\nanimation not like instantly because it's a small thing but\ninstantly because it's a small thing but\ninstantly because it's a small thing but these are why Apple designs are looking\nthese are why Apple

accomplished and\ndo you think this is accomplished and\ndo you think this is accomplished and I'm going to go ahead and show you\nI'm going to go ahead and show you\nI'm going to go ahead and show you something so if we go to react native\nreanimated and you might think yeah we\nreanimated and you might think yeah we can do like with frag animated like\ncan do like with frag animated like\ncan do like with frag animated like complex stuff but I'm going to show you\ncomplex stuff but I'm going to show you\ncomplex stuff but I'm going to show you how easy it is I'm going to scroll down\nhow easy it is I'm going to scroll down\nhow easy it is I'm going to scroll down until we\nsee entering exiting animation under\nsee entering exiting animation under layout\nlayout\nlayout animations so if I press on this button\nanimations so if I press on this button\nanimations so if I press on this button we see that it has this fade in Fade Out\nwe see that it has this fade in Fade Out\nwe see

based on\nentering and exiting Works based on mounting and unmounting a\nmounting and unmounting a\nmounting and unmounting a component and the problem is that this\ncomponent and the problem is that this\ncomponent and the problem is that this animated image is only mounted once and\nanimated image is only mounted once and\nanimated image is only mounted once and then we simply replace the\nthen we simply replace the\nthen we simply replace the source we are using the same component\nsource we are using the same component\nsource we are using the same component but simply replacing what it display\nbut simply replacing what it display\nbut simply replacing what it display because we never unmounted it we just\nbecause we never unmounted it we just\nbecause we never unmounted it we just render it once and then we replace it\nrender it once and then we replace it\nrender it once and then we replace it and it keeps being mounted in the\nand it keeps being mounted in the\nand it keeps being mounted in the component if we want to force this\ncomponent if we want to force this\ncomponent if we want to force this component\ncomponent\ncomponent to if we want to force react to\nto if we want to force react to\nto if we want to force react to initialize a new component every time we\ninitialize a new component every time we\ninitialize a new component every time we change the image we need to provide a\nchange the image we need to provide a\nchange the image we need to provide a unique key here and the key let's take\nunique key here and the key let's take\nunique key here and the key let's take it as events dot or maybe yeah it should\nit as events dot or maybe yeah it should\nit as events dot or maybe yeah it should be in this case active index or even\nbe in this case active index or even\nbe in this case active index or even maybe like active index. image\nmaybe like active index. image\nmaybe like active index. image like\nlike\nlike this so now you're going to see that\nthis so now you're going to see that\nthis so now you're going to see that when I move from one to another maybe I\nwhen I move from one to another maybe I\nwhen I move from one to another maybe I can\neven comment out this blur\neven comment out this blur view oh but we need to have a\nview oh but we need to have a\nview oh but we need to have a button and just leave somewhere here\nbutton and just leave somewhere here\nbutton and just leave somewhere here with\n72 and if I do move you're going to see\n72 and if I do move you're going to see that the privious image is fading out\nthat the privious image is fading out\nthat the privious image is fading out and the new one is fading in and we can\nand the new one is fading in and we can\nand the new one is fading in and we can achieve that we can even change the\nachieve that we can even change the\nachieve that we can even change the duration to increase it and now it's\nduration to increase it and now it's\nduration to increase it and now it's going to be\nyeah sometimes it jumps and maybe the\nyeah sometimes it jumps and maybe the images are heavier to load so like you\nimages are heavier to load so like you\nimages are heavier to load so like you can even optimize this by preloading\ncan even optimize this by preloading\ncan even optimize this by preloading some of these\nsome of these\nsome of these images uh probably with Expo image that\nimages uh probably with Expo image that\nimages uh probably with Expo image that would be better but even now like it's\nwould be better but even now like it's\nwould be better but even now like it's it's a nice going from from one image to\nit's a nice going from from one image to\nit's a nice going from from one image to another you can see that better if we\nanother you can see that better if we\nanother you can see that better if we increase this one and you're going to\nincrease this one and you're going to\nincrease this one and you're going to see that it simply goes from nothing and\nsee that it simply goes from nothing and\nsee that it simply goes from nothing and then comes the next one if I press goes\nthen comes the next one

of his key and\neverything is because of his key and\neverything is because of his key and entering and exiting because by having a\nentering and exiting because by having a\nentering and exiting because by having a unique key react says okay this is\nunique key react says okay this is\nunique key react says okay this is another key I cannot reuse the same one\nanother key I cannot reuse the

going to help you understand better why\ngoing to help you understand better why\ngoing to help you understand better why do we need this key because that's how\ndo we need this key because that's how\ndo we need this key because that's how react understands like can can I reuse\nreact understands like can can I reuse\nreact understands like can can I reuse the component or should it be recreated\nthe component or should it be recreated\nthe component or should it be recreated from scratch that's how react manages\nfrom scratch that's how react manages\nfrom scratch that's how react manages the memory of the\nthe memory of the\nthe memory of the components now if I'm going to remove\ncomponents now if I'm going to remove\ncomponents now if I'm going to remove this temporary\nthis

status our applic is already looking\nget status our applic is already looking\nget status our applic is already looking better uh blur\nbetter uh blur\nbetter uh blur background just by adding some\nblurs uh it's already looking better the\nblurs uh it's already looking better the next step is going to be a bit more\nnext step is going to be a bit more\nnext step is going to be a bit more challenging but actually before we do\nchallenging but actually before we do\nchallenging but actually before we do the next step I will show you also how\nthe next step I will show you also how\nthe next step I will show you also how we can do other entering and exiting\nwe can do other entering and exiting\nwe can do other entering and exiting animations because they are super easy\nanimations because they are super easy\nanimations because they are super easy to do and it already gives so much it\nto do and it already gives so much it\nto do and it already gives so much it makes your UI look so much better your\nmakes your UI look so much better your\nmakes your UI look so much better your applications at the beginning as you can\napplications at the beginning as you can\napplications at the beginning as you can see the screen brings the header from\nsee the screen brings the header from\nsee the screen brings the header from top to bottom and then the text as well\ntop to bottom and then the text as well\ntop to bottom and then the text as well so let's try to animate this entering\nso let's try to animate this entering\nso let's try to animate this entering animation as well to bring the top part\nanimation as well to bring the top part\nanimation as well to bring the top part down we're going to have to check what\ndown we're going to have to check what\ndown we're going to have to check what what is the top part the top part\nwhat is the top part the top part\nwhat is the top part the top part is is this view right this is the\nis is this view right this is the\nis is this view right this is the top part of the\ntop part of the\ntop part of the screen so what I'm going to do is I'm\nscreen so what I'm going to do is I'm\nscreen so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say this is going to be an\ngoing to say this is going to be an\ngoing to say this is going to be an animated do View and the entering\nanimated do View and the entering\nanimated do View and the entering animation of it is going to be I can do\nanimation of it is going to be I can do\nanimation of it is going to be I can do it as a fade in I don't need\nexiting and I will put it after the\nexiting and I will put it after the class name and now if I'm going to\nclass name and now if I'm going to\nclass name and now if I'm going to reload you're going to see that the\nreload you're going to see that the\nreload you're going to see that the whole component fads in but actually\nwhole component fads in but actually\nwhole component fads in but actually what I need is a little bit different I\nwhat I need is a little bit different I\nwhat I need is a little bit different I need it to come from top to bottom and\nneed it to come from top to bottom and\nneed it to come from top to bottom and you can see in entering and exiting\nyou can see in entering and exiting\nyou can see in entering and exiting animation what kind of animations we\nanimation what kind of animations we\nanimation what kind of animations we have here where is fade\nhave here where is fade\nhave here where is fade in Fade Out from right to bottom and so\nin Fade Out from right to bottom and so\nin Fade Out from right to bottom and so one I think apple is just not even\none I think apple is just not even\none I think apple is just not even fading in it's just simply moving them\nfading in it's just simply moving them\nfading in it's just simply moving them from top to bottom like or maybe a\nfrom top to bottom like or maybe a\nfrom top to bottom like

sliding up I will leave a duration\nview sliding up I will leave a duration original and see how it\nlooks as you can see comes from from the\nlooks as you can see comes from from the top I think it's good it takes a little\ntop I think it's good it takes a little\ntop I think it's good it takes a little bit of time to load the images\nbit of time to load the images\nbit of time to load the images so like to optimize this screen like you\nso like to optimize this screen like you\nso like to optimize this screen like you would first preload the images and only\nwould first preload the images and

now it's has and spacing from the safe area view but if I do the\nfrom the safe area view but if I do the\nfrom the safe area view but if I do the slide in up I think it has a bug it\nslide in up I

wrong but I'm not adding it here I'm\nwrong but I'm not adding it here I'm\nwrong but I'm not adding it here I'm manually adding it here and now I think\nmanually adding it here and now I think\nmanually adding it here and now I think it it kind of\nit it kind of\nit it kind of works okay and you can do the same for\nworks okay and you can do the same for\nworks okay and you can do the same for the text as well because for\nthe text as well because for\nthe text as well because for example\nexample\nexample the the text welcome to and the one from\nthe the text welcome to and the one from\nthe the text welcome to and the one from the bottom\nthe bottom\nthe bottom they all come from the top to\nbottom so I'm going to make it\nbottom so I'm going to make it anime\nanimated. text and I'm going to say\nanimated. text and I'm going to say entering is also a how's it called um\nentering is also a how's it called um\nentering is also a how's it called um slide in\nslide

the TX himself I think\nthere actually the TX himself I think here is going to be fade\nhere is going to be fade\nhere is going to be fade in up fade in up\nin up fade in up\nin up fade in up let's try fading\nlet's try fading\nlet's try fading up\nup\nup yeah fading up works much\nyeah fading up works much\nyeah fading up works much better and the same things goes to this\nbetter and the same things goes to this\nbetter and the same things goes to this one for the button so let's do animated\none for the button so let's do animated\none for the button so let's do animated do pressable hopefully it doesn't have a\npressable so animated has like most\npressable so animated has like most common components like View image text\ncommon components like View image text\ncommon components like View image text and so on but it doesn't have all\nand so on but it doesn't have all\nand so on but it doesn't have all components if you need to transform\ncomponents if you need to transform\ncomponents if you need to transform something to a animated component we can\nsomething to a animated component we can\nsomething to a animated component we can import from rect native animated create\nimport from rect native animated create\nimport from rect native animated create animated create animated component and\nanimated create animated component and\nanimated create

reim has no exported C animated component did you\nmean no wait a second let me check um\nmean no wait a second let me check um create animated component how do I\ncreate animated component how do I\ncreate animated component how do I import it\ncomponent maybe I'm going to do it with\ncomponent maybe I'm going to do it with animated dot an\nanimated dot an\nanimated dot an animated dot without importing it not\nanimated dot without importing it not\nanimated dot without importing it not sure why but this way it works now I'm\nsure why but this way it works now I'm\nsure why but this way it works now I'm going to do animated pressible I'm going\ngoing to do animated pressible I'm going\ngoing to do animated pressible I'm going to replace it with this one because I\nto replace it with this one because I\nto replace it with this one because I also want to put here the entering\nfading up yes let's do reload and now\nfading up yes let's do reload and now the button as well does fading up but as\nthe button as well does fading up but as\nthe button as well does fading up but as you can see all of them are at the same\nyou can see all of them are at the same\nyou can see all of them are at the same time in case of\ntime in case of\ntime in case of Apple some of them are first for example\nApple some of them are first for example\nApple some of them are first for example the top one is first and only then\nthe top one is first and only then\nthe top one is first and only then the the items below what we can do is we\nthe the items below what we can do is we\nthe the items below what we can do is we can do a DOT here and say delay and this\ncan do a DOT here and say delay and this\ncan do a DOT here and say delay and this is going to delay this animation by\nis going to delay this animation by\nis going to delay this animation by 1,000 seconds by 1\n1,000 seconds by 1\n1,000 seconds by 1 second as you can\nsecond as you can\nsecond as you can see maybe 1,000 is too much but 300 and\nsee maybe 1,000 is too much but 300 and\nsee maybe 1,000 is too much but 300 and same should happen to the text as well\nsame should happen to the text as well\nsame should happen to the text as well this one and this\nI don't\nI don't know as you can see I know of properties\nknow as you can see I know of properties\nknow as you can see I know of properties but I don't know how to make it look\nbut I don't know how to make it look\nbut I don't know how to make it look really\ngood and this one in the center it has a\ngood and this one in the center it has a very nice animation like this I'm not\nvery nice animation like this I'm not\nvery nice animation like this I'm not going to do that I'm going just to do a\ngoing to do that I'm going just to do a\ngoing to do that I'm going just to do a fade in so for the text in the middle\nfade in so for the text in the middle\nfade in so for the text in the middle which is not just invitees let's do it\nwhich is not just invitees let's do it\nwhich is not just invitees let's do it animated. text\nanimated do text and I'm going to do\nanimated do text and I'm going to do entering a simple fade in maybe it's\nentering a simple fade in maybe it's\nentering a simple fade in maybe it's also going to need a\ndelay I think it's uh way\ndelay I think it's uh way smoother\nsmoother\nsmoother slower for\nslower for\nslower for example this one at the\nexample this one at the\nexample this one at the top the top part entering sliding up\ntop the top part entering sliding up\ntop the top part entering sliding up maybe the duration\ntry and in this case this one will have\ntry and in this case this one will have a one f delay to start when that one\ndelay entering damping\ndelay entering damping 12 let's see if I add damping to which\n12 let's see if I add damping to which\n12 let's see if I add damping to which one to to the top\npart let's try do d\npart let's try do d damping\n12 damping let's see\n12 damping let's see damping\num entering exiting and let's do\num entering exiting and let's do ding spring base fade in Spring\nding spring base fade in Spring\nding spring base fade in Spring ify maybe I can do it spring ify because\nify maybe I can do it spring ify because\nify maybe I can do it spring ify because yeah like probably\nit's anyway I think this one is already\nit's anyway I think this one is already better\nmaybe this should be 800 no no no this\nmaybe this should be 800 no no no this one probably 1,000 but the others\none probably 1,000 but the others\none probably 1,000 but the others shouldn't wait for this to fully finish\nshouldn't wait for this to fully finish\nshouldn't wait for this to fully finish let's try it like\ntext on the top doesn't move as much as\ntext on the top doesn't move as much as the one on the\nbottom you're just finding this right\nbottom you're just finding this right values like is a challenge in\nitself yeah I think this one also needs\nitself yeah I think this one also needs for example damping 12 and\nfor example damping 12 and\nfor example damping 12 and duration 500 or maybe to make it spring\nduration 500 or maybe to make it spring\nduration 500 or maybe to make it spring ify\nactually but go ahead and play with\nactually but go ahead and play with these values yourself and see what you\nthese values yourself and see what you\nthese values yourself and see what you can achieve with them\nbecause yeah so far so good so someone\nbecause yeah so far so good so someone is saying spring ify D is saying do I\nis saying spring ify D is saying do I\nis saying spring ify D is saying do I need spring if5\nbefore if I do\nbefore if I do that\nfrom I need if I do spring ify I don't\nfrom I need if I do spring ify I don't need need duration I need Mass so\nMass 10 stiffness 100 what's going to do\nMass 10 stiffness 100 what's going to do who um\nokay that's that's also something I'm\nokay that's that's also something I'm not sure if here they do it as a\nspring maybe I can yeah but yeah again\nspring maybe I can yeah but yeah again you can play with\nyou can play with\nyou can play with it there is one overshoot\nit there is one overshoot\nit there is one overshoot clamping overshoot\nclamping overshoot\nclamping overshoot clamping true that's not going to go\nclamping true that's not going to go\nclamping true that's not going to go below\nbelow\nbelow right yeah I don't like that\noh this one is good oh yes look at this\noh this one is good oh yes look at this starts first slow downs slows down at\nstarts first slow downs slows down at\nstarts first slow downs slows down at the end oh boy I think this is really\nthe end oh boy I think this is really\nthe end oh boy I think this is really nice let me try the same for others for\nnice let me try the same for others for\nnice let me try the same for others for example for the welcome\nto what's going to to happen if I do for\nto what's going to to happen if I do for all of them but I need delays for\nhours for example dot\nhours for example dot delay for\n500 yeah I'm spending probably way too\n500 yeah I'm spending probably way too much time here\nbetter\nbetter uh I think the this one fade in doesn't\nuh I think the this one fade in doesn't\nuh I think the this one fade in doesn't need B Because doesn't have\nmovement it doesn't work something is\nmovement it doesn't work something is happening here entering fade in I'm\nhappening here entering fade in I'm\nhappening here entering fade in I'm looking at this invite\ndo duration maybe I'm going to do\ndo duration maybe I'm going to do duration 1,000 just to make sure that\nduration 1,000 just to make sure that\nduration 1,000 just to make sure that the text in the center yeah it\n500 okay now it's better all right so\n500 okay now it's better all right so I'm going to do a g ad I spent way too\nI'm going to do a g ad I spent way too\nI'm going to do a g ad I spent way too much time there but now yeah\nanimations thank you very much diamond\nanimations thank you very much diamond for giving me the hints with spring\nfor giving me the hints with spring\nfor giving me the hints with spring ifying the animation it definitely looks\nifying the animation it definitely looks\nifying the animation it definitely looks much better\nnow okay so as I was saying the next\nnow okay so as I was saying the next part is going to be super interesting\npart is going to be super interesting\npart is going to be super interesting because the next part is going to be\nbecause the next part is going to be\nbecause the next part is going to be about implementing the animation of this\nabout implementing the animation of this\nabout implementing the animation of this component the scrolling of the the\ncomponent the scrolling of the the\ncomponent the scrolling of the the component on the top because as you can\ncomponent on the top because as you can\ncomponent on the top because as you can see here in the\nsee here in the\nsee here in the video that's how it works it\nvideo that's how it works it\nvideo that's how it works it automatically Scrolls and we can also\nautomatically Scrolls and we can also\nautomatically Scrolls and we can also scroll ourself\nnext let's go ahead and start this part\nnext let's go ahead and start this part by creating a component because right\nby creating a component because right\nby creating a component because right now we on the welcome screen we have too\nnow we on the welcome screen we have too\nnow we on the welcome screen we have too many things and we're going to get a\nmany things and we're going to get a\nmany things and we're going to get a little bit confused let's go ahead and\nlittle bit confused let's go ahead and\nlittle bit confused let's go ahead and create a\ncreate a\ncreate a component\ncomponent\ncomponent Mar TSX and let's do export default\nMar TSX and let's do export default\nMar TSX and let's do export default function and and what we're going to\nfunction and and what we're going to\nfunction and and what we're going to render here return for now let's\nrender here return for now let's\nrender here return for now let's render which part I think the scroll\nrender which part I think the scroll\nrender which part I think the scroll view I'm going to leave this animated\nview I'm going to leave this animated\nview I'm going to leave this animated view because it's part of a welcome\nview because it's part of a welcome\nview because it's part of a welcome screen but the scroll view is going to\nscreen but the scroll view is going to\nscreen but the scroll view is going to go from here into our component\nhere we are going to need in this\nhere we are going to need in this component to import a view a scroll view\ncomponent to import a view a scroll view\ncomponent to import a view a scroll view an image and we need the events and the\nan image and we need the events and the\nan image and we need the events and the events probably is going to be let's do\nevents probably is going to be let's do\nevents probably is going to be let's do for now events like this later we're\nfor now events like this later we're\nfor now events like this later we're going to think how can we do it like\ngoing to think how can we do it like\ngoing to think how can we do it like reusable but for now it's going to be\nreusable but for now it's going to be\nreusable but for now it's going to be like this now if I go back to the\nlike this now if I go back to the\nlike this now if I go back to the welcome all I have to do is render this\nwelcome all I have to do is render this\nwelcome all I have to do is render this marquet element with by sending the\nmarquet element with by sending the\nmarquet element with by sending the events\nevents\nevents events like this\nevents like this\nevents like this we imported it from components and now\nwe imported it from components and now\nwe imported it from components and now we have it\nperfect now the next step you know what\nperfect now the next step you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove a\nI'm going to do is I'm going to remove a\nI'm going to do is I'm going to remove a scroll View and replace it with a normal\nscroll View and replace it with a normal\nscroll View and replace it with a normal view that has a class name Flex\nview that has a class name Flex\nview that has a class name Flex row and you might ask why would would do\nrow and you might ask why would would do\nrow and you might ask why would would do that because now we cannot scroll\nthat because now we cannot scroll\nthat because now we cannot scroll through\nthrough\nthrough it um I decided to do it this way\nit um I decided to do it this way\nit um I decided to do it this way because I want to have full control over\nbecause I want to have full control over\nbecause I want to have full control over how the items are moving in our uh\nhow the items are moving in our uh\nhow the items are moving in our uh component how we are managing the scroll\ncomponent how we are managing the scroll\ncomponent how we are managing the scroll because this\nbecause this\nbecause this component back in our scroll view the\ncomponent back in our scroll view the\ncomponent back in our scroll view the problem with a scroll view is that we\nproblem with a scroll view is that we\nproblem with a scroll view is that we cannot go back to previous items and if\ncannot go back to previous items and if\ncannot go back to previous items and if we reach the end we cannot go next what\nwe reach the end we cannot go next what\nwe reach the end we cannot go next what I want to do is I want to have an\nI want to do is I want to have an\nI want to do is I want to have an infinite scrollable component that is\ninfinite scrollable component that is\ninfinite scrollable component that is going to change and move items around to\ngoing to change and move items around to\ngoing to change and move items around to make it possible to do it infinitely\nmake it possible to do it infinitely\nmake it possible to do it infinitely scrollable that's why I'm not going to\nscrollable that's why I'm not going to\nscrollable that's why I'm not going to try to handle it for a scroll view I'm\ntry to handle it for a scroll view I'm\ntry to handle it for a scroll view I'm going to implement it myself and I'm\ngoing to implement it myself and I'm\ngoing to implement it myself and I'm going to do\ngoing to do\ngoing to do that by using here The View with a class\nthat by using here The View with a class\nthat by using here The View with a class name Flex row as I was\nname Flex row as I was\nname Flex row as I was saying now we cannot scroll but that's\nsaying now we cannot scroll but that's\nsaying now we cannot scroll but that's okay\nokay\nokay um the next thing that I'm going going\num the next thing that I'm going going\num the next thing that I'm going going to do\nto do\nto do is I'm going to extract this component\nis I'm going to extract this component\nis I'm going to extract this component into the Marquee item so let's create it\ninto the Marquee item so let's create it\ninto the Marquee item so let's create it at the top\nat the top\nat the top as Marquee\nas Marquee\nas Marquee item and what it's going to render is\nitem and what it's going to render is\nitem and what it's going to render is going to\ngoing to\ngoing to render this View and this is going to\nrender this View and this is going to\nrender this View and this is going to help us understand like what is the\nhelp us understand like what is the\nhelp us understand like what is the container of all the items and what\ncontainer of all the items and what\ncontainer of all the items and what component is responsible for rendering\ncomponent is responsible for rendering\ncomponent is responsible for rendering one of its items\none of its items\none of its items just like this now everything is still\njust like this now everything is still\njust like this now everything is still working fine but we can see the whole\nworking fine but we can see the whole\nworking fine but we can see the whole the logic of the whole scrollable\nthe logic of the whole scrollable\nthe logic of the whole scrollable container and here is the logic of one\ncontainer and here is the logic of one\ncontainer and here is the logic of one item The Next Step I want to do is um\nitem The Next Step I want to do is um\nitem The Next Step I want to do is um again let me let me say this you can\nagain let me let me say this you can\nagain let me let me say this you can achieve this in so many different ways\nachieve this in so many different ways\nachieve this in so many different ways in the following step I'm going to show\nin the following step I'm going to show\nin the following step I'm going to show you how I thought about it and how I got\nyou how I thought about it and how I got\nyou how I thought about it and how I got to this solution\nto this solution\nto this solution and let me know if you if you know a\nand let me know if you if you know a\nand let me know if you if you know a better way so what I will do next\nbetter way so what I will do next\nbetter way so what I will do next is I will actually display the\nis I will actually display the\nis I will actually display the items with absolute\nzero I don't know why they disappeared\nzero I don't know why they disappeared that's\nthat's\nthat's interesting m\nwhy did we disappear H full\nwhy did we disappear H full w96 what if I do H 96 as well yeah they\nw96 what if I do H 96 as well yeah they\nw96 what if I do H 96 as well yeah they appear back so it's Bas because of the\nappear back so it's Bas because of the\nappear back so it's Bas because of the Age full that means that I have to\nAge full that means that I have to\nAge full that means that I have to manage the height here as well so maybe\nmanage the height here as well so maybe\nmanage the height here as well so maybe I can do here H\nI can do here H\nI can do here H full yeah now it's\nfull yeah now it's\nfull yeah now it's good so I have here left\ngood so I have here left\ngood so I have here left zero what I want to do in fact is I\nzero what I want to do in fact is I\nzero what I want to do in fact is I don't want to put all of them actually\ndon't want to put all of them actually\ndon't want to put all of them actually I'm going to move the left into the\nI'm going to move the left into the\nI'm going to move the left into the style\nstyle\nstyle property and say left\nproperty and say left\nproperty and say left zero maybe I can do and this key\nzero maybe I can do and this key\nzero maybe I can do and this key shouldn't be handled here it's handled\nshouldn't be handled here it's handled\nshouldn't be handled here it's handled here at the Marquee so I don't need it\nhere at the Marquee so I don't need it\nhere at the Marquee so I don't need it at this\nat this\nat this level\nlevel\nlevel anyway we have left zero here but the\nanyway we have left zero here but the\nanyway we have left zero here but the thing is that I don't want all the items\nthing is that I don't want all the items\nthing is that I don't want all the items to be\nto be\nto be positioned zero pixels from the left I\npositioned zero pixels from the left I\npositioned zero pixels from the left I want only the first item to be here then\nwant only the first item to be here then\nwant only the first item to be here then the next one to be a little bit to the\nthe next one to be a little bit to the\nthe next one to be a little bit to the to the left and so on and in fact let me\nto the left and so on and in fact let me\nto the left and so on and in fact let me go ahead and open up some diagramming\ngo ahead and open up some diagramming\ngo ahead and open up some diagramming because we're going to need a lot of\nbecause we're going to need a lot of\nbecause we're going to need a lot of that in order to understand how to move\nthat in order to understand how to move\nthat in order to understand how to move things around so let me open some\ndiagramming let's imagine that we have\ndiagramming let's imagine that we have here the\nhere the\nhere the phone let's also Imagine give some uh\nphone let's also Imagine give some uh\nphone let's also Imagine give some uh wids for example I'm going to suppose\nwids for example I'm going to suppose\nwids for example I'm going to suppose that the wi of our phone is let's say\nthat the wi of our phone is let's say\nthat the wi of our phone is let's say 500 units or pixels or maybe to simplify\n500 units or pixels or maybe to simplify\n500 units or pixels or maybe to simplify it we can give it\nit we can give it\nit we can give it 100 so the width of my phone is 100\n100 so the width of my phone is 100\n100 so the width of my phone is 100 units pixels inch I don't know 100\nunits pixels inch I don't know 100\nunits pixels inch I don't know 100 something then we have cards\nsomething then we have cards\nsomething then we have cards we don't know yet like what the WID of a\nwe don't know yet like what the WID of a\nwe don't know yet like what the WID of a card\ncard\ncard is but we have cards of a specific\nwave and it's going to\nwave and it's going to go\nhere and this one is going to go here\nhere and this one is going to go here this card is going to be card number one\nthis card is going to be card number one\nthis card is going to be card number one this one is\nthis one is\nthis one is card number two and this one is card\ncard number two and this one is card\ncard number two and this one is card number\nthree okay let's um go ahead and give\nthree okay let's um go ahead and give these cards a very specific wh for\nthese cards a very specific wh for\nthese cards a very specific wh for example maybe for the sake of\nexample maybe for the sake of\nexample maybe for the sake of Simplicity I'll do it 50\npixels and let's say that they are like\npixels and let's say that they are like this close together there is no gap\nthis close together there is no gap\nthis close together there is no gap between them\nbetween them\nbetween them so I will make\nso I will make\nso I will make them 50 pixels like\nthis okay um just because we say we have\nthis okay um just because we say we have a specific wave of items let's give it\na specific wave of items let's give it\na specific wave of items let's give it here so let's do uh const item\nhere so let's do uh const item\nhere so let's do uh const item width is going to be equal to 50 do I\nwidth is going to be equal to 50 do I\nwidth is going to be equal to 50 do I need it here or maybe I let's let's do\nneed it here or maybe I let's let's do\nneed it here or maybe I let's let's do it at the top first and then we're going\nit at the top first and then we're going\nit at the top first and then we're going to figure out how to do it like more\nto figure out how to do it like more\nto figure out how to do it like more dynamically so item with is 50 I'm\ndynamically so item with is 50 I'm\ndynamically so item with is 50 I'm actually going to say that the width of\nactually going to say that the width of\nactually going to say that the width of this\nthis\nthis view is item with and I'm not going to\nview is item with and I'm not going to\nview is item with and I'm not going to give it 96\ngive it 96\ngive it 96 here 50 is too little so I'm going to\nhere 50 is too little so I'm going to\nhere 50 is too little so I'm going to bump it up to\nbump it up to\nbump it up to 500\n500\n500 300 something like\n300 something like\n300 something like that maybe 250 to be half of a screen\nthat maybe 250 to be half of a screen\nthat maybe 250 to be half of a screen similar to our\nsimilar to our\nsimilar to our diagram so if you want closer values not\ndiagram so if you want closer values not\ndiagram so if you want closer values not to get confused our screen size let's\nto get confused our screen size let's\nto get confused our screen size let's assume it's 50 and the size of one of\nassume it's 50 and the size of one of\nassume it's 50 and the size of one of these items is\nthese items is\nthese items is 250\n250\n250 250 250\nso if I say that the item should be\nso if I say that the item should be position left zero that means zero\nposition left zero that means zero\nposition left zero that means zero pixels from the left part from from this\npixels from the left part from from this\npixels from the left part from from this side of our\nside of our\nside of our screen so this\nscreen so this\nscreen so this side that's good for the first item but\nside that's good for the first item but\nside that's good for the first item but the second item should be at position\nthe second item should be at position\nthe second item should be at position 250 because that's the size of this item\n250 because that's the size of this item\n250 because that's the size of this item the thir item should be 250 plus 250 so\nthe thir item should be 250 plus 250 so\nthe thir item should be 250 plus 250 so in fact the left or the let's do con\nin fact the left or the let's do con\nin fact the left or the let's do con initial\ninitial\ninitial position should be equal\nposition should be equal\nposition should be equal to the item with multiplied by the index\nto the item with multiplied by the index\nto the item with multiplied by the index of the\nof the\nof the item index of\nitem index of\nitem index of item the index of item we're going to\nitem the index of item we're going to\nitem the index of item we're going to send it through properties because from\nsend it through properties because from\nsend it through properties because from the item inside we don't know which is\nthe item inside we don't know which is\nthe item inside we don't know which is the\nthe\nthe index but from the outside when we for\nindex but from the outside when we for\nindex but from the outside when we for them we will know the index and we can\nthem we will know the index and we can\nthem we will know the index and we can send it through properties to our\nsend it through properties to our\nsend it through properties to our item now we take initial position and\nitem now we take initial position and\nitem now we take initial position and say that the left is equal to initial\nsay that the left is equal to initial\nsay that the left is equal to initial position let's reload and now we should\nposition let's reload and now we should\nposition let's reload and now we should see\nsee\nsee this and we see spacing between them\nthis and we see spacing between them\nthis and we see spacing between them because we have pting on this View and\nbecause we have pting on this View and\nbecause we have pting on this View and IM the image is actually smaller than\nIM the image is actually smaller than\nIM the image is actually smaller than the whole\nthe whole\nthe whole component I'm going to remove this one\ncomponent I'm going to remove this one\ncomponent I'm going to remove this one and you're going to see that the images\nand you're going to see that the images\nand you're going to see that the images touch each\ntouch each\ntouch each or to better think about it we can do\nor to better think about it we can do\nor to better think about it we can do background uh\nbackground uh\nbackground uh purple\npurple\npurple 700 and let's do it as\n700 and let's do it as\n700 and let's do it as 20% or 50% so now you see that actually\n20% or 50% so now you see that actually\n20% or 50% so now you see that actually as we have in this diagram they the\nas we have in this diagram they the\nas we have in this diagram they the items themselves are close\nitems themselves are close\nitems themselves are close together and they are positioned\ntogether and they are positioned\ntogether and they are positioned correctly right\nright what's the next step the next step\nright what's the next step the next step is to handle the\nis to handle the\nis to handle the scrolling let me think like what's going\nscrolling let me think like what's going\nscrolling let me think like what's going to be easier to to show you the\nto be easier to to show you the\nto be easier to to show you the automated scrolling or the manual\nautomated scrolling or the manual\nautomated scrolling or the manual scrolling I think it's going to be the\nscrolling I think it's going to be the\nscrolling I think it's going to be the automated\nautomated\nautomated scrolling for the automated

this is how I manually did that\nway okay this is how I manually did that but what I can do is I can start this um\nbut what I can do is I can start this um\nbut what I can do is I can start this um automated\nautomated\nautomated animation which can be started in a use\nanimation which can be started in a use\nanimation which can be started in a use effect with with timing but what I'm\neffect with with timing but what I'm\neffect with with timing but what I'm going to do is in fact I'm going to\ngoing to do is in fact I'm going to\ngoing to do is in fact I'm going to use a compo uh hook\nuse a compo uh hook\nuse a compo uh hook called\ncalled\ncalled uh how is it use any M frame frame\nuh how is it use any M frame frame\nuh how is it use any M frame frame something like\nthat use frame\nthat use frame callback use frame callback is a hook\ncallback use frame callback is a hook\ncallback use frame callback is a hook that lets us run a function on every\nthat lets us run a function on every\nthat lets us run a function on every frame update so if our application is of\nframe update so if our application is of\nframe update so if our application is of has a frame rate of 60 Seconds of 60\nhas a frame rate of 60 Seconds of 60\nhas a frame rate of 60 Seconds of 60 frames per second that means that we can\nframes per second that means that we can\nframes per second that means that we can run a function 60 times every second and\nrun a function 60 times every second and\nrun a function 60 times every second and we can apply real time animations like\nwe can apply real time animations like\nwe can apply real time animations like this so that's what I'm going to\nthis so that's what I'm going to\nthis so that's what I'm going to do in this component I'm going to manage\ndo in this component I'm going to manage\ndo in this component I'm going to manage the scroll inside this\nthe scroll inside this\nthe scroll inside this use frame\nuse frame\nuse frame callback and I'm going to say hey this\ncallback and I'm going to say hey this\ncallback and I'm going to say hey this Frame callback comes from reanimated as\nFrame callback comes from reanimated as\nFrame callback comes from reanimated as well and I'm going to say hey scroll\nwell and I'm going to say hey scroll\nwell and I'm going to say hey scroll value should\nvalue should\nvalue should be equal to scroll. Value + one what do\nbe equal to scroll. Value + one what do\nbe equal to scroll. Value + one what do you think is going to happen in this\nyou think is going to happen in this\nyou think is going to happen in this case and it doesn't have this um\ncase and it doesn't have this um\ncase and it doesn't have this um dependency array it's just a function in\ndependency array it's just a function in\ndependency array it's just a function in this\nthis\nthis case like every frame rate we're going\ncase like every frame rate we're going\ncase like every frame rate we're going to move items one pixels to the right\nto move items one pixels to the right\nto move items one pixels to the right and it should start at zero\num what I want to do is I want this\num what I want to do is I want this scroll to actually move up like from\nscroll to actually move up like from\nscroll to actually move up like from zero to 1 2 3 4 and so on but I want the\nzero to 1 2 3 4 and so on but I want the\nzero to 1 2 3 4 and so on but I want the items to uh move in the direction so I'm\nitems to uh move in the direction so I'm\nitems to uh move in the direction so I'm going the Marquee item in the animated\ngoing the Marquee item in the animated\ngoing the Marquee item in the animated style I'm going to say initial position\nstyle I'm going to say initial position\nstyle I'm going to say initial position minus scroll value and this way is going\nminus scroll value and this way is going\nminus scroll value and this way is going to move there so as you can see it's\nto move there so as you can see it's\nto move there so as you can see it's already working\nhello\nhello mobin and the way it works is this\nmobin and the way it works is this\nmobin and the way it works is this function that we added to the use frame\nfunction that we added to the use frame\nfunction that we added to the use frame callback is being called on any on every\ncallback is being called on any on every\ncallback is being called on any on every frame on every frame so it's being\nframe on every frame so it's being\nframe on every frame so it's being called 60 times a second on average and\ncalled 60 times a second on average and\ncalled 60 times a second on average and what we do like on every frame we move a\nwhat we do like on every frame we move a\nwhat we do like on every frame we move a scroll one\nscroll one\nscroll one pixel we move a scroll like yeah one\npixel we move a scroll like yeah one\npixel we move a scroll like yeah one pixel and then we move all the items\npixel and then we move all the items\npixel and then we move all the items when we render\nwhen we render\nwhen we render to the\nleft this is working but let me show you\nleft this is working but let me show you a an actually a little bit better way of\na an actually a little bit better way of\na an actually a little bit better way of doing\ndoing\ndoing that what I mean is by using a let's do\nthat what I mean is by using a let's do\nthat what I mean is by using a let's do um um scroll speed is equal to one by\num um scroll speed is equal to one by\num um scroll speed is equal to one by having a value here we can apply it like\nhaving a value here we can apply it like\nhaving a value here we can apply it like this scroll value scroll speed and then\nthis scroll value scroll speed and then\nthis scroll value scroll speed and then we can change the scroll speed to 10 and\nwe can change the scroll speed to 10 and\nwe can change the scroll speed to 10 and it's going to move faster so we have\nit's going to move faster so we have\nit's going to move faster so we have influence on how fast we\nmove I'm going to leave it to one for a\nmove I'm going to leave it to one for a second this is fine but it's not exactly\nsecond this is fine but it's not exactly\nsecond this is fine but it's not exactly right because as I was saying this\nright because as I was saying this\nright because as I was saying this function is called approximately 60\nfunction is called approximately

around um let me first\nand move items around um let me first\nand move items around um let me first integrate with gestures so that we can\nintegrate with gestures so that we can\nintegrate with gestures so that we can also scroll using gestures here not only\nalso scroll using gestures here not only\nalso scroll using gestures here not only using uh automation because it's going\nusing uh automation because it's going\nusing uh automation because it's going to help us a lot understand better like\nto help us a lot understand better like\nto help us a lot understand better like how things move and uh is going to help\nhow things move and uh is going to help\nhow things move and uh is going to help us yeah understand how things are moving\nus yeah understand how things are moving\nus yeah understand how things are moving so as I was saying on Apple here this\nso as I was saying on Apple here this\nso as I was saying on Apple here this items are moving automatically but we\nitems are moving automatically but we\nitems are moving automatically but we can also swipe through\ncan also swipe through\ncan also swipe through ourself that's really cool and that's\nourself that's really cool and that's\nourself that's really cool and that's not super hard to implement for that\nnot super hard to implement for that\nnot super hard to implement for that we're going to use the gesture Handler\nwe're going to use the gesture Handler\nwe're going to use the gesture Handler re native gesture Handler together with\nre native gesture Handler together with\nre native gesture

I'm going to wrap my whole component in a\nwrap my whole component in a\nwrap my whole component in a gesture\ngesture\ngesture detector and I'm going to send there the\ndetector and I'm going to send there the\ndetector and I'm going to send there the gesture that we just created\nhere okay like this I'm going to end it\nhere okay like this I'm going to end it at the bottom so\none so where you

here it is events on begin this\nokay here it is events on begin this\nokay here it is events on begin this function is called when a\nfunction is called when a\nfunction is called when a gesture doesn't explain super well but\ngesture doesn't explain super well but\ngesture doesn't explain super well but basically the on begin is called as the\nbasically the on begin is called as the\nbasically the on begin is called as the first function when the gesture just\nfirst function when the gesture just\nfirst function when the gesture just starts but it's not yet determined if\nstarts but it's not yet determined if\nstarts but it's not yet determined if it's going to be the gesture that we\nit's going to be the gesture that we\nit's going to be the gesture that we want for example a pen gesture implies\nwant for example a pen gesture implies\nwant for example a pen gesture implies pressing moving the finger and then\npressing moving the finger and then\npressing moving the finger and then releasing that's a a pen gesture so if\nreleasing that's a a pen gesture so if\nreleasing that's a a pen gesture so if we just press and don't move a finger\nwe just press and don't move a finger\nwe just press and don't move a finger it's going to stop here if we press and\nit's going to stop here if we press and\nit's going to stop here if we press and start moving it's going to do on\nstart moving it's going to do on\nstart moving it's going to do on start so here on start\nstart so here on start\nstart so here on start then as we move it's going to call on\nthen as we move it's going to call on\nthen as we move it's going to call on change and then there is also on\nchange and then there is also on\nchange and then there is also on update and at the end it's first going\nupdate and at the end it's first going\nupdate and at the end it's first going to call on end if the gesture was\nto call on end if the gesture was\nto call on end if the gesture was detected and started but if not it's\ndetected and started but if not it's\ndetected and started but if not it's going to call I mean in any case it's\ngoing to call I mean in any case it's\ngoing to call I mean in any case it's going to call on finalize so on begin is\ngoing to call on finalize so on begin is\ngoing to call on finalize so on begin is first last on finalize on start second\nfirst last on finalize on start second\nfirst last on finalize on start second then on end if only this one started and\nthen on end if only this one started and\nthen on end if only this one started and I'm going to show you the difference if\nI'm going to show you the difference if\nI'm going to show you the difference if I just press and release we see on begin\nI just press and release we see on begin\nI just press and release we see on begin and on finalize the gesture be began but\nand on finalize the gesture be began but\nand on finalize the gesture be began but it didn't start it was not detected if I\nit didn't start it was not detected if I\nit didn't start it was not detected if I press and move we see on begin on start\npress and move we see on begin on start\npress and move we see on begin on start update change update change because we\nupdate change update change because we\nupdate change update change because we are kind of the same and at the end we\nare kind of the same and at the end we\nare kind of the same and at the end we see on end and on\nsee on end and on\nsee on end and on finalize on end is only called if on\nfinalize on end is only called if on\nfinalize on end is only called if on start has been called\nstart has been called\nstart has been called so that's important to understand\nso that's important to understand\nso that's important to understand because it's the same for everything\nbecause it's the same for everything\nbecause it's the same for everything else and in our case what I'm going to\nelse and in our case what I'm going to\nelse and in our case what I'm going to say is\nsay is\nsay is hey first of all I'm going to transform\nhey first of all I'm going to transform\nhey first of all I'm going to transform our speed from a value to a shared value\nour speed from a value to a shared value\nour speed from a value to a shared value because I'm going to uh update it\nbecause I'm going to uh update it\nbecause I'm going to uh update it because it's a Shar value when I use it\nbecause it's a Shar value when I use it\nbecause it's a Shar value when I use it I need to use it as\nI need to use it as\nI need to use it as value and in the gesture when we begin\nvalue and in the gesture when we begin\nvalue and in the gesture when we begin this gesture\nthis gesture\nthis gesture I will say scroll speed. value equal Z\nI will say scroll speed. value equal Z\nI will say scroll speed. value equal Z I'll basically stop the automated scroll\nI'll basically stop the automated scroll\nI'll basically stop the automated scroll so if I press I stop the\nso if I press I stop the\nso if I press I stop the scrolling now at the end on finalize I'm\nscrolling now at the end on finalize I'm\nscrolling now at the end on finalize I'm going to restart automated scrolling\ngoing to restart automated scrolling\ngoing to restart automated scrolling scroll speed. value equal to\nscroll speed. value equal to\nscroll speed. value equal to 50 I will remove on start and on end\nor maybe I should do that in the on\nor maybe I should do that in the on start and on\nend yeah let me do this on start and on\nend yeah let me do this on start and on end because if I just press where the\nend because if I just press where the\nend because if I just press where the screen without actually doing the\nscreen without actually doing the\nscreen without actually doing the gesture maybe I don't\ngesture maybe I don't\ngesture maybe I don't need to stop this so now it goes\nneed to stop this so now it goes\nneed to stop this so now it goes automatically if I press nothing\nautomatically if I press nothing\nautomatically if I press nothing happens but no that's the problem if I\nhappens but no that's the problem if I\nhappens but no that's the problem if I press it should stop automatically cuz\npress it should stop automatically cuz\npress it should stop automatically cuz now it stops when I start dragging so\nnow it stops when I start dragging so\nnow it stops when I start dragging so that's why I'm going to go to on\nthat's why I'm going to go to on\nthat's why I'm going to go to on start with on finalize as you can see\nstart with on finalize as you can see\nstart with on finalize as you can see move these two kind of methods start\nmove these two kind of methods start\nmove these two kind of methods start finalize and\nfinalize and\nfinalize and begin wait a second I'm already\nbegin wait a second I'm already\nbegin wait a second I'm already lost I man on\nlost I man on\nlost I man on begin on finalize they work together so\nbegin on finalize they work together so\nbegin on finalize they work together so when I change one usually that means\nwhen I change one usually that means\nwhen I change one usually that means that you want to change W as well so now\nthat you want to change W as well so now\nthat you want to change W as well so now if I just simply press it\nif I just simply press it\nif I just simply press it stops if I release it starts again press\nstops if I release it starts again press\nstops if I release it starts again press it stops release starts\nit stops release starts\nit stops release starts again now the next step is like when I\nagain now the next step is like when I\nagain now the next step is like when I move the finger on the screen I want to\nmove the finger on the screen I want to\nmove the finger on the screen I want to move that scroll\nmove that scroll\nmove that scroll position that's not super hard to do\nposition that's not super hard to do\nposition that's not super hard to do because we have this either on update or\nbecause we have this either on update or\nbecause we have this either on update or on change\non change\non change update is called when things are updated\nupdate is called when things are updated\nupdate is called when things are updated on change is also called van but it also\non change is also called van but it also\non change is also called van but it also has an additional property called change\nhas an additional property called change\nhas an additional property called change X which has only the difference in the\nX which has only the difference in the\nX which has only the difference in the position from the previous time the on\nposition from the previous time the on\nposition from the previous time the on change has been called that's good\nchange has been called that's good\nchange has been called that's good because we can apply it to the scroll\nbecause we can apply it to the scroll\nbecause we can apply it to the scroll value so we can take scroll value and\nvalue so we can take scroll value and\nvalue so we can take scroll value and add the change X to our scroll value if\nadd the change X to our scroll value if\nadd the change X to our scroll value if I go back and start\nI go back and start\nI go back and start scrolling as you can see something is\nscrolling as you can see something is\nscrolling as you can see something is moving but it's in V Direction so\nmoving but it's in V Direction so\nmoving but it's in V Direction so probably I should do here\nminus now if I\nminus now if I reload if I start moving it follows\nreload if I start moving it follows\nreload if I start moving it follows exactly my movement if I release it\nexactly my movement if I release it\nexactly my movement if I release it continues\nautomatically cool\nautomatically cool perfect so that's\nperfect so that's\nperfect so that's simple but now let me finalize it with a\nsimple but now let me finalize it with a\nsimple but now let me finalize it with a little touch that is going to make it so\nlittle touch that is going to make it so\nlittle touch that is going to make it so much better and this is usually called\nmuch better and this is usually called\nmuch better and this is usually called momentum\nmomentum\nmomentum scroll when\nscroll when\nscroll when we move the finger fast and release it\nwe move the finger fast and release it\nwe move the finger fast and release it we want items to move very fast if we\nwe want items to move very fast if we\nwe want items to move very fast if we just slowly move and release it we want\njust slowly move and release it we want\njust slowly move and release it we want them to continue to continue the\nthem to continue to continue the\nthem to continue to continue the velocity of our scroll right so to do\nvelocity of our scroll right so to do\nvelocity of our scroll right so to do that on finalize here if we look at the\nevent uh the event is going to have the\nevent uh the event is going to have the Velocity\nVelocity\nVelocity X which if\nX which if\nX which if I scroll slow and release the velocity\nI scroll slow and release the velocity\nI scroll slow and release the velocity is going to be small value like 95 if I\nis going to be small value like 95 if I\nis going to be small value like 95 if I do the same but release it fast it's\ndo the same but release it fast it's\ndo the same but release it fast it's going to be minus\ngoing to be minus\ngoing to be minus 3,000 so we can take this value and we\n3,000 so we can take this value and we\n3,000 so we can take this value and we can apply to the\ncan apply to the\ncan apply to the speed we can apply it simply like this\nspeed we can apply it simply like this\nspeed we can apply it simply like this event velocity apply it\nevent velocity apply it\nevent velocity apply it here so if I slowly release\nminus so if I slowly release it it\nminus so if I slowly release it it continues the same\nmovement if I do it fast it continues\nmovement if I do it fast it continues the same move movement the thing is that\nthe same move movement the thing is that\nthe same move movement the thing is that I want to the speed to start that high\nI want to the speed to start that high\nI want to the speed to start that high but then to go back to this 50 then SC\nbut then to go back to this 50 then SC\nbut then to go back to this 50 then SC slow down I can do that\nslow down I can do that\nslow down I can do that by\nby\nby using scroll\nusing scroll\nusing scroll value uh wave\nanimation modifier and I'm going to move\nanimation modifier and I'm going to move towards the value 50 but over time not\ntowards the value 50 but over time not\ntowards the value 50 but over time not instantly so now if I scroll\ninstantly so now if I scroll\ninstantly so now if I scroll fast doesn't\nfast doesn't\nfast doesn't work oh because it's not scroll but\nwork oh because it's not scroll but\nwork oh because it's not scroll but scroll speed scroll speed. value\nthis and I think I will do that over\nthis and I think I will do that over longer duration\nand when if you look at the reanimated\nand when if you look at the reanimated website at the with\nwebsite at the with\nwebsite at the with timing with\ntiming with\ntiming with timing we're going to see the different\ntiming we're going to see the different\ntiming we're going to see the different easing methods so the\neasing methods so

would\nto this animation a very usual one would be a linear\nbe a linear\nbe a linear animation linear and it will look like\nanimation linear and it will look like\nanimation linear and it will look like this so if we go from 0 to 100 it's\nthis so if we go from 0 to 100 it's\nthis so if we go from 0 to 100 it's going to linearly go from 0 to 100 and\ngoing to linearly go from 0 to 100 and\ngoing to linearly go from 0 to 100 and it looks like this very linear with the\nit looks like this very linear with the\nit looks like this very linear with the same speed all over there is the the\nsame speed all over there is the the\nsame speed all over there is the the most common one probably is in and out\nmost common one probably is in and out\nmost common one probably is in and out which

everything works we have uh I'm going to write here\nhave uh I'm going to write here\nhave uh I'm going to write here scroll is equal to zero if scroll is\nscroll is equal to zero if scroll is\nscroll is equal to zero if scroll is equal to zero\nto to\nto to 250 we have the following situation like\n250 we have the following situation like\n250 we have the following situation like all V move 250 to the left\nall V move 250 to the left\nall V move 250 to the left okay and if scroll is equal\nto\nto 750 that means that all items move one\n750 that means that all items move one\n750 that means that all items move one two and three items to the left so in\ntwo and three items to the left so in\ntwo and three items to the left so in this situation we already see the\nthis situation we already see the\nthis situation we already see the problem is that the items are two to the\nproblem is that the items are two to the\nproblem is that the items are two to the left and we don't not see anything here\nleft and we don't not see anything here\nleft and we don't not see anything here at the\nat the\nat the beginning and if the scroll increases\nbeginning and if the scroll increases\nbeginning and if the scroll increases more and more more and more the items\nmore and more more and more the items\nmore and more more and more the items are going to go farther and farther from\nare going to go farther and farther from\nare going to go farther and farther from the device and we're not going to see\nthe device and we're not going to see\nthe device and we're not going to see them at\nthem at\nthem at all the thing is that we are not going\nall the thing is that we are not going\nall the thing is that we are not going to do anything about the scroll um\nto do anything about the scroll um\nto do anything about the scroll um position the scroll is going to be a\nposition the scroll is going to be a\nposition the scroll is going to be a value that can go to maximum integer\nvalue that can go to maximum integer\nvalue that can go to maximum integer value and minimum so it can go to 1 15,\nvalue and minimum so it can go to 1 15,\nvalue and minimum so it can go to 1 15, 235 and in that case like you can think\n235 and in that case like you can think\n235 and in that case like you can think like these items are very very far\nlike these items are very very far\nlike these items are very very far that way but what we need to do is we\nthat way but what we need to do is we\nthat way but what we need to do is we need to take any value that the scroll\nneed to take any value that the scroll\nneed to take any value that the scroll view here has and understand like where\nview here has and understand like where\nview here has and understand like where we should place it here on the\nwe should place it here on the\nwe should place it here on the screen the way we're going to do that\nscreen the way we're going to do that\nscreen the way we're going to do that let's go back to 750 is that for example\nlet's go back to 750 is that for example\nlet's go back to 750 is that for example when the scroll is 750 what I'm going to\nwhen the scroll is 750 what I'm going to\nwhen the scroll is 750 what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the first item\ndo is I'm going to take the first item\ndo is I'm going to take the first item and I'm going to move it all the way\nand I'm going to move it all the way\nand I'm going to move it all the way here maybe in fact the second item as\nhere maybe in fact the second item as\nhere maybe in fact the second item as well I'm going to move it here\nwell I'm going to move it here\nwell I'm going to move it here so how does this movement going to\nwork well let's go ahead and\nwork well let's go ahead and first Define what is going to be the\nfirst Define what is going to be the\nfirst Define what is going to be the full with of our uh items so our\nitems\nitems um container\num container\num container with is going to be equal to in this\nwith is going to be equal to in this\nwith is going to be equal to in this case is 1,000 right but it can be\ncase is 1,000 right but it can be\ncase is 1,000 right but it can be calculated by multiplying the number of\ncalculated by multiplying the number of\ncalculated by multiplying the number of items\nitems\nitems with the amount of items now we know\nwith the amount of items now we know\nwith the amount of items now we know that it's 1,000 these are just\nthat it's 1,000 these are just\nthat it's 1,000 these are just values now let's draw a\nvalues now let's draw a\nvalues now let's draw a box of 1,000 W for\nbox of 1,000 W for\nbox of 1,000 W for example like\nexample like\nexample like this and this is going to be red this is\nthis and this is going to be red this is\nthis and this is going to be red this is going to be our bounds and I'm going to\ngoing to be our bounds and I'm going to\ngoing to be our bounds and I'm going to actually do it 1,000 with like\nactually do it 1,000 with like\nactually do it 1,000 with like this and let's place it not here but\nthis and let's place it not here but\nthis and let's place it not here but let's place it centered to the phone\nlet's place it centered to the phone\nlet's place it centered to the phone device like this that means that we have\ndevice like this that means that we have\ndevice like this that means that we have 50 pixels here we have 50 pixels left\n50 pixels here we have 50 pixels left\n50 pixels here we have 50 pixels left which means that this\n250 and this part is\n250 and this part is 250 now this red box is going to be\n250 now this red box is going to be\n250 now this red box is going to be the the box that is going to Define when\nthe the box that is going to Define when\nthe the box that is going to Define when do we move stuff around meaning as we\ndo we move stuff around meaning as we\ndo we move stuff around meaning as we scroll as the

continue we continue moving we move move move as\nwe continue moving we move move move as\nwe continue moving we move move move as we come here two goes outside the red\nwe come here two goes outside the red\nwe come here two goes outside the red box we go\nthat well that is going to happen on VAP\nthat well that is going to happen on VAP Marky item because every item is going\nMarky item because every item is going\nMarky item because every item is going to handle their left position I\n[Laughter]\n[Laughter] individually\nso first of all we need to\nso first of all we need to know the size of this container the\nknow the size of this container the\nknow the size of this container the container\ncontainer\ncontainer with the container\nwith the container\nwith the container with we can\nwith we can\nwith we can calculate in the whole con array because\ncalculate in the whole con array because\ncalculate in the whole con array because here we know how many items we have so\nhere we know how many items we have so\nhere we know how many items we have so let's do\nlet's do\nlet's do uh container\nuh container\nuh container width equal to events do length multiply\nwidth equal to events do length multiply\nwidth equal to events do length multiply by item with so the amount of items\nby item with so the amount of items\nby item with so the amount of items multiply their with let's take this\nmultiply their with let's take this\nmultiply their with let's take this container with and give them to our\ncontainer with and give them to our\ncontainer with and give them to our

go ahead and receive the\nwith let's go ahead and receive the container with as a number\ncontainer with as a number\ncontainer with as a number here and now knowing the container with\nhere and now knowing the container with\nhere and now knowing the container with we can say\nwe can say\nwe can say hey uh I'm going to add here\nhey uh I'm going to add here\nhey uh I'm going to add here const uh\nconst uh\nconst uh left position or just left or just let's\nleft position or just left or just let's\nleft position or just left or just let's do\ndo\ndo position equal to initial position minus\nposition equal to initial position minus\nposition equal to initial position minus scroll value and this position is going\nscroll value and this position is going\nscroll value and this position is going to go\nto go\nto go here the problem with this uh Thing by\nhere the problem with this uh Thing by\nhere the problem with this uh Thing by taking initial position which can be\ntaking initial position which can be\ntaking initial position which can be let's consider for the let's look at the\nlet's consider for the let's look at the\nlet's consider for the let's look at the first item the initial position is zero\nfirst item the initial position is zero\nfirst item the initial position is zero so0 minus scroll value that means that\nso0 minus scroll value that means that\nso0 minus scroll value that means that this value can be a very large\nthis value can be a very large\nthis value can be a very large value because I'm going to take the same\nvalue because I'm

we're going to see how how it\nwell and we're going to see how how it works for example in the case of scroll\nworks for example in the case of scroll\nworks for example in the case of scroll is\nis\nis 750\n750\n750 our or maybe even like more I'm going to\nour or maybe even like more I'm going to\nour or maybe even like more I'm going to do one even bigger example for us to\ndo one even bigger example for us to\ndo one even bigger example for us to understand like how it looks if\nunderstand like how it looks if\nunderstand like how it looks if it's\nit's\nit's 1,250\n1,250 so it's going to be like this\n1,250 so it's going to be like this which means that all the items are\nwhich means that all the items are\nwhich means that all the items are outside our window our red window so in\noutside our window our red window so in\noutside our window our red window so in this case the first item\nthis case the first item\nthis case the first item is going to get the initial position of\nis going to get the initial position of\nis going to get the initial position of minus\n1,250 but if we go ahead and take this\n1,250 but if we go ahead and take this value and then\nvalue and then\nvalue and then we uh take\nwe uh take\nwe uh take them we divide it by the container with\nthem we divide it by the container with\nthem we divide it by the container with and take the remainder of\nit that means that we take\nit that means that we take the2 1,250\nthe2 1,250\nthe2 1,250 we divide it by container with 1,000 but\nwe divide it by container with 1,000 but\nwe divide it by container with 1,000 but we take only their remainder and the\nwe take only their remainder and the\nwe take only their remainder and the remainder is going to be 250 and 250\nremainder is going to be 250 and 250\nremainder is going to be 250 and 250 means that the one is moving to this\nmeans that the one is moving to this\nmeans that the one is moving to this position in this\nposition in this\nposition in this situation so by simply doing this\nsituation so by simply doing this\nsituation so by simply doing this remainder we create a bound we create a\nremainder we create a bound we create a\nremainder we create a bound we create a limit of where the items cannot go past\nlimit of where the items cannot go past\nlimit of where the items cannot go past and if they go past they come back to\nand if they go past they come back to\nand if they go past they come back to the previous position and as you can see\nthe previous position and as you can see\nthe previous position and as you can see they come back\nthey come back\nthey come back here not exactly where we want but we\nhere not exactly where we want but we\nhere not exactly where we want but we come back there the problem is\nthat now how we do it divided by\nthat now how we do it divided by container\nthis yes because this is the container\nthis yes because this is the container with this window is 1,000\nwith this window is 1,000\nwith this window is 1,000 pixels and normally it would be here\npixels and normally it would be here\npixels and normally it would be here with green but we reverse it we do minus\nwith green but we reverse it we do minus\nwith green but we reverse it we do minus scroll view to move it in the other\nscroll view to move it in the other\nscroll view to move it in the other direction so but from here from a normal\ndirection so but from here from a normal\ndirection so but from here from a normal position it goes all the way\nposition it goes all the way\nposition it goes all the way here so that's\nhere so that's\nhere so that's why when our items go away from\nwhy when our items go away from\nwhy when our items go away from here in fact when they reach this\nhere in fact when they reach this\nhere in fact when they reach this position when their beginning goes\nposition when their beginning goes\nposition when their beginning goes outside the bound that means that they\noutside the bound that means that they\noutside the bound that means that they come back here so that's why we see the\ncome back here so that's why we see the\ncome back here so that's why we see the following result it kind of works but it\nfollowing result it kind of works but it\nfollowing result it kind of works but it comes back to the middle of the

but to the beginning of the screen here if that\nthe beginning of the screen here if that\nthe beginning of the screen here if that makes\nsense what we have to\nsense what we have to do is to move this window from here back\ndo is to move this window from here back\ndo is to move this window from here back to where we want it all the way\nhere and to do that what we are going to\nhere and to do that what we are going to have to\nhave to\nhave to check we are going to have to calculate\ncheck we are going to have to calculate\ncheck we are going to have to calculate this\nthis\nthis shift because initially this position is\nshift because initially this position is\nshift because initially this position is here we need to move it a bit to to\nhere we need to move it a bit to to\nhere we need to move it a bit to to center it in this container to center it\ncenter it in this container to center it\ncenter it in this container to center it in this\nin this\nin this container we need to take the whole\ncontainer we need to take the whole\ncontainer we need to take the whole container with\n1,000 take out the screen WID 500 and\n1,000 take out the screen WID 500 and then divide it by two because we have a\nthen divide it by two because we have a\nthen divide it by two because we have a bit to the left and a bit to the right\nbit to the left and a bit to the right\nbit to the left and a bit to the right so this is the amount of shift that\nso this is the amount of shift that\nso this is the amount of shift that we're going to have to do the 250 that\nwe're going to have to do the 250 that\nwe're going to have to do the 250 that you see here to get to this 250 again we\nyou see here to get to this 250 again we\nyou see here to get to this 250 again we take the container WID we uh subtract\ntake the container WID we uh subtract\ntake the container WID we uh subtract the width of our screen and then we\nthe width of our screen and then we\nthe width of our screen and then we divide it by two to see how much is to\ndivide it by two to see how much is to\ndivide it by two to see how much is to the left and how much is to the right of\nthe left and how much is to the

uh\nthis one uh\nthis one uh const\nconst\nconst shift equal to\ncontainer WID so container WID minus the\ncontainer WID so container WID minus the WID of a screen screen\nwith uh divided by two because we need\nwith uh divided by two because we need to take we this way we know how much is\nto take we this way we know how much is\nto take we this way we know how much is outside the screen

for\nit's on the right it should be+ 10 for example for that we use an interpolate\nexample for that we use an interpolate\nexample for that we use an interpolate function an interpolate function can map\nfunction an interpolate function can map\nfunction an interpolate function can map a value from one range to another one so\na value from one range to another one so\na value from one range to

with\nit's going to move together with animated value but it should be\nanimated value but it should be\nanimated value but it should be somewhere here\nsomewhere here\nsomewhere here like so it

uh that's why I'm going to use a\nvisible uh that's why I'm going to use a\nvisible uh that's why I'm going to use a use animated reaction and this is\nuse animated reaction and this is\nuse animated

we're going to get the\nsecond function we're going to get the value of that\nvalue of that\nvalue of that scroll and I can do console log\nscroll and I can do console log\nscroll and I can do console

with\nanimation when we have to work with actual cards that we want to display in\nactual cards that we want to display in\nactual cards that we want to display in this component we don't have to mess\nthis component we don't have to mess\nthis component we don't have to mess around with all of this we active index\naround with all of this we active index\naround with all of this we active index and so on\nand so on\nand so on we can work on the higher level for\nwe can work on the higher level for\nwe can work on the higher level for example we can add here A\nexample we can add here A\nexample we can add here A View and we can add the image and then\nView and we can add the image and then\nView and we can add the image and then we can add a\nwe can add a\nwe can add a text\ntext\ntext saying B\nbirthday\nbirthday party and then this image can be uh\nabsolute uh\nabsolute uh um this\num this\num this view class name is also going to be H\nview class name is also going to be H\nview class name is also going to be H full with\nfull with\nfull with full now this birthday party is going to\nfull now this birthday party is going to\nfull now this birthday party is going to be text white and it's going to\nbe text white and it's going to\nbe text white and it's going to be let's do here um\nbe let's do here um\nbe let's do here um items bottom or items\nitems bottom or items\nitems bottom or items end no item Center and\nend no item Center and\nend no item Center and justify and\nI'm not sure if you can see it but I'm\nI'm not sure if you can see it but I'm going to do here a footer\ncomponent with birthday party it says\ncomponent with birthday party it says height one no height should\nheight one no height should\nheight one no height should be I don't know um\n24 it can be I don't need this item\n24 it can be I don't need this item Center here\n[Music]\n[Music] I will\nparty so I will do something like text\nparty so I will do something like text to\nto\nto XEL text\nXEL text\nXEL text Center and\nCenter and\nCenter and here justif y\nhere justif y\nhere justif y center something like\nthat and maybe this view is actually\nthat and maybe this view is actually going to be a\ngoing to be a\ngoing to be a blur\nblur\nblur view with intensity of\nview with intensity of\nview with intensity of 50 or\n50 or\n50 or 20 or one or\n20 or one or\n20 or one or 10 okay that's good uh I'm not sure if\n10 okay that's good uh I'm not sure if\n10 okay that's good uh I'm not sure if this background color works here no it\ndoesn't\ndoesn't absolute don't need the absolute no no\nabsolute don't need the absolute no no\nabsolute don't need the absolute no no no it's normally\npositioned and maybe what I will do is I\npositioned and maybe what I will do is I will do instead of background instead of\nwill do instead of background instead of\nwill do instead of background instead of here\nA A View\nA A View that will be class name full full like\nthat will be class name full full like\nthat will be class name full full like this and\nabsolute this is going to add this dark\nabsolute this is going to add this dark effect so instead of doing this normal\neffect so instead of doing this normal\neffect so instead of doing this normal view maybe I'm going to add a linear\nview maybe I'm going to add a linear\nview maybe I'm going to add a linear gradient so there is\ngradient so there is\ngradient so there is Expo linear\ngradient that we can install like this\ngradient that we can install like this and we're going to use it like\nthis you can use image background\nthis you can use image background component yeah I think I can use image\ncomponent yeah I think I can use image\ncomponent yeah I think I can use image background as well but what's going to\nbackground as well but what's going to\nbackground as well but what's going to be the benefit compared to an absolute\nbe the benefit compared to an absolute\nbe the benefit compared to an absolute image another thing I see now is that um\nimage another thing I see now is that um\nimage another thing I see now is that um the image has\nthe image has\nthe image has rounded but in fact I want this\nrounded but in fact I want this\nrounded but in fact I want this component to be rounded like this one\ncomponent to be rounded like this one\ncomponent to be rounded like this one not the image itself\nnot the image itself\nnot the image itself and if I add overflow hidden it should\nand if I add overflow hidden it should\nand if I add overflow hidden it should hide the the Overflow now it's\nhide the the Overflow now it's\nhide the the Overflow now it's better now back to my linear gradient\nbetter now back to my linear gradient\nbetter now back to my linear gradient experiment that I want you to\nexperiment that I want you to\nexperiment that I want you to try if I go ahead here an import linear\ngradient and\ngradient and change where is\nchange where is\nchange where is it this\nit this\nit this view to a linear gradient like\nthis I will re comment out this View and\nthis I will re comment out this View and it's going to be let's do Styles\nit's going to be let's do Styles\nit's going to be let's do Styles shet where is styleset\nshet where is styleset\nshet where is styleset dot look if I\ndot look if I\ndot look if I import Styles\nimport Styles\nimport Styles shet there is an absolute\nshet there is an absolute\nshet there is an absolute F\nF\nF helper that will do absolute and will F\nhelper that will do absolute and will F\nhelper that will do absolute and will F the whole\nview so if I have zero here that's going\nview so if I have zero here that's going to be something like\nto be something like\nto be something like that if I do red here okay the bottom is\nthat if I do red here okay the bottom is\nthat if I do red here okay the bottom is red I need other way

and maybe not like transparent or\neight and maybe not like transparent or I would need another option here like I\nI would need another option here like I\nI would need another option here like I don't know six or something like\nthat if I do four it doesn't make sense\nthat if I do four it doesn't make sense because that's normal but I wanted more\nbecause that's normal but I wanted more\nbecause that's normal but I wanted more at the bottom and a bit less to the top\nat the bottom and a bit less to the top\nat the bottom and a bit less to the top I think that's what I was looking\nfor and if I do back to 20\nfor and if I do back to 20 intensity it's better it's not exactly\nintensity it's better it's not exactly\nintensity it's better it's not exactly what they have here because as I look\nwhat they have here because as I look\nwhat they have here because as I look here we have a linear gradient blur view\nhere we have a linear gradient blur view\nhere we have a linear gradient blur view but in my\nhelps I don't know if it helps but yeah\nhelps I don't know if it helps but yeah it help it definitely helps\nokay okay so this is what we have\nokay okay so this

for example should actually go\nexample should actually go\nexample should actually go here in this\nhere in this\nhere in this situation\nsituation\nsituation so\nso\nso yeah in our case we only have

confusing because\nsaying and it's it's confusing because the scroll is in the positive direction\nthe scroll is in the positive direction\nthe scroll is in the positive direction and then the position will reverse it\nso yeah like if we do not consider the\nso yeah like if we do not consider the shift like let me put it here like the\nshift like let me put it here like the\nshift like let me put it here like the box is like this because we do not have\nbox is like this because we do not have\nbox is like this because we do not have a shift this one is like\na shift this one is like\na shift this one is like this and\nshift position plus shift meaning it\nshift position plus shift meaning it goes\ngoes\ngoes here by\nhere by\nhere by default and\ndefault and\ndefault and if

case uh is when scroll goes into\ncase uh is when scroll goes into\ncase uh is when scroll goes into negative usually scroll is positive but\nnegative usually scroll is positive but\nnegative usually

yeah\nso uh maybe here RGB like this yeah\nso uh maybe here RGB like this yeah that's good font\nand it's a different font it's a rounded\nand it's a different font it's a rounded font I'm not going to do that now but if\nfont I'm not going to do that now but if\nfont I'm not going to do that now but if I type here go and type here I need to\nI type here go and type here I need to\nI type here go and type here I need to say that the text should be\nwhite\nwhite white so if I type okay that's\nwhite so if I type okay that's\nwhite so if I type okay that's good now we need um\na uh view that is going to be this Row\na uh view that is going to be this Row for this\nfor this\nfor this input this view is going to have a\ninput this view is going to have a\ninput this view is going to have a

last one is\nlocation\nlocation pin\ngood that's it\ngood that's it that there\nscreen and maybe the header or the image\nscreen and maybe the header or the image picker here should\npicker here should\npicker here should be bigger maybe it should\nbe one half of a screen Maybe\nbe one half of a screen Maybe that's not\nthat's not\nthat's not bad and with that we have uh created\nbad and with that we have uh created\nbad and with that we have uh created this one\nhere perfect lastly we would need to\nhere perfect lastly we would need to store things like in the state for\nstore things like in the state for\nstore things like in the state for example the title the\ndate and the location for the title it's\ndate and the location for the title it's super easy because the title is a text\nsuper easy because the title is a text\nsuper easy because the title is a text input and we can give here value title\ninput and we can give here value title\ninput and we can give here value title on change\ntitle but for the date um and location\ntitle but for the date um and location for date we need a date picker and for\nfor date we need a date picker and for\nfor date we need a date picker and for location we would need a to ask for the\nlocation we would need a to ask for the\nlocation we would need a to ask for the user location or\nuser location or\nuser location or to okay

And in this live stream, I'm going to explain the\nlive stream, I'm going to explain the\nlive stream, I'm going to explain the CSS animations, CSS transitions, how\nCSS animations, CSS transitions, how\nCSS animations, CSS transitions, how they work, when should you use it. We're\nthey work, when should you use it. We're\nthey work, when should you use it. We're going to explore the API. I'm going to\ngoing to explore the API. I'm going to\ngoing to explore the API. I'm going to tell you uh what's the difference\ntell you uh what's the difference\ntell you uh what's the difference between other APIs in reanimated\nbetween other APIs in reanimated\nbetween other APIs in reanimated and going to life code a useful um\nand going to life code a useful um\nand going to life code a useful um feature that you can use in your apps uh\nfeature that you can use in your apps uh\nfeature that you can use in your apps uh day-to-day like a real life example for\nday-to-day like a real life example for\nday-to-day like a real life example for CSS animations and transitions. So first\nCSS animations and transitions. So first\nCSS animations and transitions. So first things step I'm going to create a new uh\nthings step I'm going to create a new uh\nthings step I'm going to create a new uh expo project.\nexpo project.\nexpo project. So, I'm gonna You can see it. I believe\nSo, I'm gonna You can see it. I believe\nSo, I'm gonna You can see it. I believe you should see it. Well, I'm going to CD\nyou should see it.

Made it for\nMade it for\nMade it for live stream.\nFor live stream. Okay. I need to install\nFor live stream. Okay. I need to install a couple of libraries for this example\na couple of libraries for this example\na couple of libraries for this example to work. So I'm going to CD into\nto work. So I'm going to CD into\nto work. So I'm going to CD into reanimated CSS animations. And the most\nreanimated CSS animations. And the most\nreanimated CSS animations. And the most important one is obviously reanimated.\nimportant one is obviously reanimated.\nimportant one is obviously reanimated. So reanimated latest and worklets\nSo reanimated latest and worklets\nSo reanimated latest and worklets latest. So React Native worklets is uh\nlatest. So React Native worklets is uh\nlatest.

Why not?\nAnd the pre-tier. Why not?\nAnd the pre-tier. Why not? Okay. Installed pretty quickly. I'm\nOkay. Installed pretty quickly. I'm\nOkay. Installed pretty quickly. I'm going to do an expert pre-build.\nIt's going to install the cocoa pods. So\nIt's going to install the cocoa pods. So it's going to take a while. So okay what\nit's going to take a while. So okay what\nit's going to take a while. So okay what are what are two new concepts in\nare what are two new concepts in\nare what are two new concepts in reanimator 4 besides worklets these are\nreanimator 4 besides worklets these are\nreanimator 4 besides worklets these are CSS animations and CSS transitions\nCSS animations and CSS transitions\nCSS animations and CSS transitions and start from this CSS animations\nand start from this CSS animations\nand start from this CSS animations and CSS transitions\ntransitions and you use them in two\ntransitions and you use them in two different ways in two different\ndifferent ways in two different\ndifferent ways in two different situations. So CSS animations are kinds\nsituations. So CSS animations are kinds\nsituations. So CSS animations are kinds of fire and forget. Okay. So they can\nof fire and forget. Okay. So they can\nof fire and forget. Okay. So they can run once or twice or infinitely or more.\nrun once or twice or infinitely or more.\nrun once or twice or infinitely or more. But the these do not require uh user\nBut the these do not require uh user\nBut the these do not require uh user input. Okay. So these are fire and\ninput. Okay. So these are fire and\ninput. Okay. So these are fire and forget. Let me\nforget. Let me\nforget. Let me let me add it to the notes. Fire and\nlet me add it to the notes. Fire and\nlet me add it to the notes. Fire and forget.\nforget.\nforget. Okay. and CSS transitions on the on the\nOkay. and CSS transitions on the on the\nOkay. and CSS transitions on the on the other hand they need a state they need a\nother hand they need a state they need a\nother hand they need a state they need a react state and react rerender so they\nreact state and react rerender so they\nreact state and react rerender so they are state based\nare state based\nare state based okay you can use react contexts you can\nokay you can use react contexts you can\nokay you can use react contexts you can use sant or redux it doesn't really\nuse sant or redux it doesn't really\nuse sant or redux it doesn't really matter but they don't need a rerender to\nmatter but they don't need a rerender to\nmatter but they don't need a rerender to work\nwork\nwork and so these are state bound these are\nand so these are state bound these are\nand so these are state bound these are implemented by um key frames so uh there\nimplemented by um key frames so uh there\nimplemented by um key frames so uh there are two properties that you need for CSS\nare two properties that you need for CSS\nare two properties that you need for CSS animations and two for CSS transitions\nanimations and two for CSS transitions\nanimations and two for CSS transitions to work. So this is animation let me\nto work. So this is animation let me\nto work. So this is animation let me change the color\nchange the color\nchange the color uh animation name\nand animation duration.\nand animation duration. You need to specify as well the\nYou need to specify as well the\nYou need to specify as well the animation duration because by default\nanimation duration because by default\nanimation duration because by default animation duration is zero. So when you\nanimation duration is zero. So when you\nanimation duration is zero. So when you want to have an animation you need to\nwant to have an animation you need to\nwant to have an animation you need to specify as well and the animation name\nspecify as well and the animation name\nspecify as well and the animation name uh these are key frames. This is a bit a\nuh these are key frames. This is a bit a\nuh these are key frames. This is a bit a bit confusing because uh because of\nbit confusing because uh because of\nbit confusing because uh because of legacy reasons from the web uh on the\nlegacy reasons from the web uh on the\nlegacy reasons from the web uh on the web CSS animation name is a string but\nweb CSS animation name is a string but\nweb CSS animation name is a string but for us animation name is a is a\nfor us animation name is a is a\nfor us animation name is a is a JavaScript object and this JavaScript\nJavaScript object and this JavaScript\nJavaScript object and this JavaScript object are key frames.\nobject are key frames.\nobject are key frames. Let me put that key frames.\nLet me put that key frames.\nLet me put that key frames. Okay,\nsomething like that. These are key\nsomething like that. These are key frames.\nframes.\nframes. For CSS transitions, we have two\nFor CSS transitions, we have two\nFor CSS transitions, we have two properties that are required as well.\nproperties that are required as well.\nproperties that are required as well. Transition property and transition\nTransition property and transition\nTransition property and transition duration.\nduration.\nduration. Let me duplicate that one.\ntransition property\ntransition property and transition duration.\nand transition duration.\nand transition duration. Transition duration by default is zero.\nTransition duration by default is zero.\nTransition duration by default is zero. Uh for CSS animations, you specify key\nUh for CSS animations, you specify key\nUh for CSS animations, you specify key frames. For transition property, you\nframes. For transition property, you\nframes. For transition property, you specify properties that are going to be\nspecify properties that are going to be\nspecify properties that are going to be animated with the react state. Let me\nanimated with the react state. Let me\nanimated with the react state. Let me put that\nput that\nput that um properties.\num properties.\num properties. Make it a bit bigger. and add a\nMake it a bit bigger. and add a\nMake it a bit bigger. and add a okay\nand these two\nand these two are required.\nYou can add modifiers to both CSS\nYou can add modifiers to both CSS animations and CSS transitions that\nanimations and CSS transitions that\nanimations and CSS transitions that change how the transition or the\nchange how the transition or the\nchange how the transition or the animation look like.\nanimation look like.\nanimation look like. Set plus modifiers.\nOkay,\nOkay, so this is the bare bare minimum you\nso this is the bare bare minimum you\nso this is the bare bare minimum you need to know uh to understand anything\nneed to know uh to understand anything\nneed to know uh to understand anything from CSS animations transitions and let\nfrom CSS animations transitions and let\nfrom CSS animations transitions and let me check my um my build. We have the\nme check my um my build. We have the\nme check my um my build. We have the cocoa pots installed. That's good. We\ncocoa pots installed. That's good. We\ncocoa pots installed. That's good. We have reanimated installed worklets\nhave reanimated installed worklets\nhave reanimated installed worklets installed mask view as well and keyboard\ninstalled mask view as well and keyboard\ninstalled mask view as well and keyboard control. That seems good. I'm also uh\ncontrol. That seems good. I'm also uh\ncontrol. That seems good. I'm also uh going to to\ngoing to to\ngoing to to set up prettier.\nset up prettier.\nset up prettier. Okay, so that's all the setup we need.\nOkay, so that's all the setup we need.\nOkay, so that's all the setup we need. I'm going to open it with VS Code as my\nI'm going to open it with VS Code as my\nI'm going to open it with VS Code as my daily driver.\ndaily driver.\ndaily driver. Uh I don't need an update right now\nUh I don't need an update right now\nUh I don't need an update right now during live stream. Um okay. So I have\nduring live stream. Um okay. So I have\nduring live stream. Um okay. So I have iOS and Android folders available for me\niOS and Android folders available for me\niOS and Android folders available for me because I did a pre-built.\nbecause I did a pre-built.\nbecause I did a pre-built. I'm going to add these folders to Gitar\nas because of pre-built I don't need to\nas because of pre-built I don't need to have them uh on my on my computer at all\nhave them uh on my on my computer at all\nhave them uh on my on my computer at all times. I do have to have them on my\ntimes. I do have to have them on my\ntimes. I do have to have them on my computer, but they don't have to be\ncomputer, but they don't have to be\ncomputer, but they don't have to be check out to Git.\ncheck out to Git.\ncheck out to Git. That seems correct. That seems correct.\nThat seems correct. That seems correct.\nThat seems correct. That seems correct. That seems correct as well. We have\nThat seems correct as well. We have\nThat seems correct as well. We have reanimated\nreanimated\nreanimated 4.0. That's perfect. And we have\n4.0. That's perfect. And we have\n4.0. That's perfect. And we have worklets installed as well. Okay, I'm\nworklets installed as well. Okay, I'm\nworklets installed as well. Okay, I'm going to run IDE because it's my daily\ngoing to run IDE because it's my daily\ngoing to run IDE because it's my daily driver. And wait for the build.\ndriver. And wait for the build.\ndriver. And wait for the build. And let me also explain some more of CSS\nAnd let me also explain some more of CSS\nAnd let me also explain some more of CSS animations. It says transitions as the\nanimations. It says transitions as the\nanimations. It says transitions as the build goes.\nbuild goes.\nbuild goes. So that's uh setup.\nSo that's uh setup.\nSo that's uh setup. Hit commit.\nHit commit.\nHit commit. Uh I want to also remove all the code\nUh I want to also remove all the code\nUh I want to also remove all the code that Xbox gave me. So I'm going to run\nthat Xbox gave me.

No, I want to delete them. All of them.\nNo, I want to delete them. All of them.\nNo, I want to delete them. All of them. That's perfect. And we have a blank\nThat's perfect. And we have a blank\nThat's perfect. And we have a blank slate.\nslate.\nslate. Perfect. Great for live coding.\nPerfect. Great for live coding.\nPerfect. Great for live coding. uh setup v2\nuh setup v2\nuh setup v2 and this is building okay so let's let's\nand this is building okay so let's let's\nand this is building okay so let's let's explore the API a little bit more and\nexplore the API a little bit more and\nexplore the API a little bit more and for this I have\nfor this I have\nfor this I have the introducing react native reimated\nthe introducing react native reimated\nthe introducing react native reimated for video uh because there is uh if you\nfor video uh because there is uh if you\nfor video uh because there is uh if you haven't watched this video you\nhaven't watched this video you\nhaven't watched this video you definitely should it goes through the\ndefinitely should it goes through the\ndefinitely should it goes through the details what we've changed in reanimated\ndetails what we've changed in reanimated\ndetails what we've changed in reanimated what's new what's interesting so should\nwhat's new what's interesting so should\nwhat's new what's interesting so should definitely check this out but for this\ndefinitely check this out but for this\ndefinitely check this out but for this live stream I'm also only need this uh\nlive stream I'm also only need this uh\nlive stream I'm also only need this uh these two uh these two examples because\nthese two uh these two examples because\nthese two uh these two examples because they show the new features really really\nthey show the new features really really\nthey show the new features really really well. So on the left I have CSS\nwell. So on the left I have CSS\nwell. So on the left I have CSS transition and I'm specifying to\ntransition and I'm specifying to\ntransition and I'm specifying to transition property and transition\ntransition property and transition\ntransition property and transition duration. The transition property said\nduration. The transition property said\nduration. The transition property said that transform is going to be animated\nthat transform is going to be animated\nthat transform is going to be animated and it's going to be animated from five\nand it's going to be animated from five\nand it's going to be animated from five to zero. Okay, with the react state\nto zero. Okay, with the react state\nto zero. Okay, with the react state right here on press in on press out it\nright here on press in on press out it\nright here on press in on press out it change from five to zero and you can\nchange from five to zero and you can\nchange from five to zero and you can change how the animation look like with\nchange how the animation look like with\nchange how the animation look like with transition timing function.

You can also pass a cubic bzier if you need\ncubic bzier if you need\ncubic bzier if you need and all the good stuff right so this is\nand all the good stuff right so this is\nand all the good stuff right so this is transition timing function\ntransition timing function\ntransition timing function have the examples yeah that was ease I\nhave the examples yeah that was ease I\nhave the examples yeah that was ease I believe\nbelieve\nbelieve so that's the basic of CSS transition\nso that's the basic of CSS transition\nso that's the basic of CSS transition for CSS animations we have animation\nfor CSS animations we have animation\nfor CSS animations we have animation name which I said as I said it's a key\nname which I said as I said it's a key\nname which I said as I said it's a key frame okay and this key frame can go\nframe okay and this key frame can go\nframe okay and this key frame can go from zero to 100 there are different\nfrom zero to 100 there are different\nfrom zero to 100 there are different syntax acts for different preferences.\nsyntax acts for different preferences.\nsyntax acts for different preferences. There's no difference. You can set um as\nThere's no difference. You can set um as\nThere's no difference. You can set um as numbers or as strings. You can also say\nnumbers or as strings. You can also say\nnumbers or as strings. You can also say from and to. From is 0% to is 100%.\nfrom and to. From is 0% to is 100%.\nfrom and to. From is 0% to is 100%. And what this animation does, it wiggles\nAnd what this animation does, it wiggles\nAnd what this animation does, it wiggles a little bit from left to right. So it\na little bit from left to right. So it\na little bit from left to right. So it rotates from 7° to negative 10°, back to\nrotates from 7° to negative 10°, back to\nrotates from 7° to negative 10°, back to 10°, -7, and back to zero. So it's a\n10°, -7, and back to zero. So it's a\n10°, -7, and back to zero. So it's a wiggle. Okay. It takes two and a half\nwiggle. Okay. It takes two and a half\nwiggle. Okay. It takes two and a half seconds and it repeats infinitely.\nseconds and it repeats infinitely.\nseconds and it repeats infinitely. So yeah, CSS animations fire forget this\nSo yeah, CSS animations fire forget this\nSo yeah, CSS animations fire forget this will work um till the end of time.\nwill work um till the end of time.\nwill work um till the end of time. Joking uh till the screen is uh removed.\nJoking uh till the screen is uh removed.\nJoking uh till the screen is uh removed. And this one from CSS transition need a\nAnd this one from CSS transition need a\nAnd this one from CSS transition need a state to change. Let me see the radon is\nstate to change. Let me see the radon is\nstate to change. Let me see the radon is built my app. Perfect. That works great.\nbuilt my app. Perfect. That works great.\nbuilt my app. Perfect. That works great. I'm going to make the the text a little\nI'm going to make the the text a little\nI'm going to make the the text a little bit bigger for you guys. Yeah,\nbit bigger for you guys. Yeah,\nbit bigger for you guys. Yeah, definitely. Increase font size.\nIs that okay? No, maybe something\nIs that okay? No, maybe something bigger.\nbigger.\nbigger. That should be okay.\nThat should be okay.\nThat should be okay. Yeah, that should be okay.\nYeah, that should be okay.\nYeah, that should be okay.

So, we're going to have text\nthat. So, we're going to have text\nthat. So, we're going to have text um in the middle. It's going to animate\num in the middle. It's going to animate\num in the middle. It's going to animate with CSS animations. The gradient is\nwith CSS animations. The gradient is\nwith CSS animations. The gradient is going to uh wiggle or rotate. And I'm\ngoing to uh wiggle or rotate. And I'm\ngoing to uh wiggle or rotate. And I'm going to have a input that's animate\ngoing to have a input that's animate\ngoing to have a input that's animate with a with a button. So, the button is\nwith a with a button.

I'm going to mock\nOkay, that's the idea. I'm going to mock\nOkay, that's the idea. I'm going to mock it really really quickly in Teaw right\nit really really quickly in Teaw right\nit really really quickly in Teaw right here.\nhere.\nhere. Have hello Casper.\nHave hello Casper.\nHave hello Casper. Something like that.\nAnd that's why I needed a mask view for\nAnd that's why I needed a mask view for this for this text.

Yep.\ndefaults to ease. Yep. I'm wondering if using state together\nI'm wondering if using state together\nI'm wondering if using state together with transition property has any\nwith transition property has any\nwith transition property has any performance impact or would it be better\nperformance impact or would it be better\nperformance impact or would it be better to use shared value from reanimated 4\nto use shared value from reanimated 4\nto use shared value from reanimated 4 for smoother performance? That's a good\nfor smoother performance? That's a good\nfor smoother performance? That's a good question actually. So for transition\nquestion actually. So for transition\nquestion actually. So for transition property, you need to have a react\nproperty, you need to have a react\nproperty, you need to have a react rerender and shared values won't work.\nrerender and shared values won't work.\nrerender and shared values won't work. It won't have uh a better performance.\nIt won't have uh a better performance.\nIt won't have uh a better performance. It just won't work. So you should just\nIt just won't work. So you should just\nIt just won't work. So you should just use use state for this.\nuse use state for this.\nuse use state for this. for uh for performance reasons. Yes,\nfor uh for performance reasons. Yes,\nfor uh for performance reasons. Yes, that's also part of the question.\nthat's also part of the question.\nthat's also part of the question. You can specify\nYou can specify\nYou can specify for transition property, you can specify\nfor transition property, you can specify\nfor transition property, you can specify all to animate all properties, but you\nall to animate all properties, but you\nall to animate all properties, but you should never do that. You should always\nshould never do that. You should always\nshould never do that. You should always just say which property you want to\njust say which property you want to\njust say which property you want to animate. It's going to be more\nanimate. It's going to be more\nanimate. It's going to be more performant that way. You can just say,\nperformant that way. You can just say,\nperformant that way. You can just say, \"Yeah, okay, just animate everything.\"\n\"Yeah, okay, just animate everything.\"\n\"Yeah, okay, just animate everything.\" That's going to have performance impact.\nThat's going to have performance impact.\nThat's going to have performance impact. Great question. Just specify the\nGreat question. Just specify the\nGreat question. Just specify the property you want to animate and use uh\nproperty you want to animate and use uh\nproperty you want to animate and use uh react renders. So react state. Okay.\nreact renders. So react state. Okay.\nreact renders. So react state. Okay. Nice.\nNice.\nNice. Uh where was I? Okay. Masked view.\nUh where was I? Okay. Masked view.\nUh where was I? Okay. Masked view. Masked view. I'm going to take this code\nMasked view. I'm going to take this code\nMasked view. I'm going to take this code because it's perfect for what I need and\nbecause it's perfect for what I need and\nbecause it's perfect for what I need and paste it right here.\npaste it right here.\npaste it right here. Import the mask view from the library.\nImport the mask view from the library.\nImport the mask view from the library. What's the What's the import? Like so.\ngood. I'm going to move my rotating\ngood. I'm going to move my rotating gradient inside of the mask\nlike that.\nlike that. Okay. Yeah,\nOkay. Yeah,\nOkay. Yeah, I can see it rotates. Maybe that's not\nI can see it rotates. Maybe that's not\nI can see it rotates. Maybe that's not the best gradient. Can you see it as\nthe best gradient. Can you see it as\nthe best gradient. Can you see it as well? Not really. No.\nwell? Not really. No.\nwell? Not really. No. What kind of property can be used?\nWhat kind of property can be used?\nWhat kind of property can be used? uh any um\nuh any um\nuh any um you can't use\nyou can't use\nyou can't use layout properties. So for that so for\nlayout properties. So for that so for\nlayout properties. So for that so for example you can't animate flex direction\nexample you can't animate flex direction\nexample you can't animate flex direction from row to column\nuh you can only use it with layout\nuh you can only use it with layout animations. Well it's not uh not allowed\nanimations. Well it's not uh not allowed\nanimations. Well it's not uh not allowed but it's not going to animate. So I\nbut it's not going to animate. So I\nbut it's not going to animate. So I think there is a in the documentation\nthink there is a in the documentation\nthink there is a in the documentation there is a\nthere is a\nthere is a yeah there's example for that. So if you\nyeah there's example for that. So if you\nyeah there's example for that. So if you have discrete\nhave discrete\nhave discrete properties like flex column uh it won't\nproperties like flex column uh it won't\nproperties like flex column uh it won't smoothly animate for that you need to\nsmoothly animate for that you need to\nsmoothly animate for that you need to use layout animations. Okay.\nuse layout animations. Okay.\nuse layout animations. Okay. Yeah. Flex direction justify content.\nYeah. Flex direction justify content.\nYeah. Flex direction justify content. It's not going to animate. But you can\nIt's not going to animate. But you can\nIt's not going to animate. But you can use opacities, transforms, widths,\nuse opacities, transforms, widths,\nuse opacities, transforms, widths, margins,\nmargins,\nmargins, etc.\netc.\netc. So colors also. Yeah, colors also as\nSo colors also. Yeah, colors also as\nSo colors also. Yeah, colors also as well.\nI'm going to change the gradient to look\nI'm going to change the gradient to look to a bit different one. Maybe it will be\nto a bit different one. Maybe it will be\nto a bit different one. Maybe it will be better for the live stream for this one.\nbetter for the live stream for this one.\nbetter for the live stream for this one. For example,\nFor example,\nFor example, flex. Oh, flex. Uh I'm not sure. I I\nflex. Oh, flex. Uh I'm not sure. I I\nflex. Oh, flex. Uh I'm not sure. I I believe there is an example in the CSS\nbelieve there is an example in the CSS\nbelieve there is an example in the CSS example app in reanimated that you could\nexample app in reanimated that you could\nexample app in reanimated that you could use flex.\nI think there is a there is an example\nI think there is a there is an example that uses flex. So I I think yes, but\nthat uses flex. So I I think yes, but\nthat uses flex. So I I think yes, but I'm not 100% sure.\nOkay, that looks good.\nOkay, that looks good. Yeah,\nYeah,\nYeah, that that looks good. Okay,\nI'm going to change that to greeting\nI'm going to change that to greeting styles greeting\nand I'm going to move it to\nand I'm going to move it to mask mask.\nNo. Okay.\nNo. Okay. styles.mmask\nand this move to mask view. Okay, this\nand this move to mask view. Okay, this is basically what I wanted to achieve\nis basically what I wanted to achieve\nis basically what I wanted to achieve for CSS animations. Let's move to um CSS\nfor CSS animations. Let's move to um CSS\nfor CSS animations. Let's move to um CSS transitions next.\ntransitions next.\ntransitions next. Mask view.\nMask view.\nMask view. Yep. And here\nlike that.\nlike that. and like that.\nAmazing. Okay.\nAmazing. Okay. So, for CSS transitions, we're going to\nSo, for CSS transitions, we're going to\nSo, for CSS transitions, we're going to use\nuse\nuse we're going to have a text input with a\nwe're going to have a text input with a\nwe're going to have a text input with a button. The button is going to move from\nbutton. The button is going to move from\nbutton. The button is going to move from left to right on user focus when the\nleft to right on user focus when the\nleft to right on user focus when the keyboard is shown. And when someone taps\nkeyboard is shown. And when someone taps\nkeyboard is shown. And when someone taps it, it's going to shrink a little bit\nit, it's going to shrink a little bit\nit, it's going to shrink a little bit with scale. And when you send a message,\nwith scale. And when you send a message,\nwith scale. And when you send a message, we're not going to implement the sending\nwe're not going to implement the sending\nwe're not going to implement the sending message. I believe we're not going to\nmessage. I believe we're not going to\nmessage. I believe we're not going to have enough time, but just to mock it,\nhave enough time, but just to mock it,\nhave enough time, but just to mock it, it's gonna shoot up to the sky to\nit's gonna shoot up to the sky to\nit's gonna shoot up to the sky to indicate that it's going to send. Okay.\nindicate that it's going to send. Okay.\nindicate that it's going to send. Okay. So, these are three CSS transitions.\nSo, these are three CSS transitions.\nSo, these are three CSS transitions. Yep.\nYep.\nYep. So, next, add a text input.\nOkay. Import that.\nOkay. Import that. Okay. And let me add a placeholder\nOkay. And let me add a placeholder\nOkay. And let me add a placeholder placeholder in a second. But I want to\nplaceholder in a second. But I want to\nplaceholder in a second. But I want to have a button. And that's going to be a\nhave a button. And that's going to be a\nhave a button. And that's going to be a pressable.\nOkay.\nOkay. And for the pressable, I'm going to use\nAnd for the pressable, I'm going to use\nAnd for the pressable, I'm going to use um arrow from Expo Font. Expo icons, I\num arrow from Expo Font. Expo icons, I\num arrow from Expo Font. Expo icons, I believe. Expo icons. Yep.\nbelieve. Expo icons. Yep.\nbelieve. Expo icons. Yep. Arrow.\nand I don't have to install it. It's\nand I don't have to install it. It's already pre-installed in Expo projects.\nalready pre-installed in Expo projects.\nalready pre-installed in Expo projects. So, this is very handy.\nAnd let's see, make it white. But I want\nAnd let's see, make it white. But I want to have pressible\nto have pressible\nto have pressible as\nas\nas blue.\nOkay, we're going to implement the\nOkay, we're going to implement the transitions in a second.\n50 50 that's okayish\n50 50 that's okayish okay so I can see the button but it's\nokay so I can see the button but it's\nokay so I can see the button but it's very very ugly I'm going to source the\nvery very ugly I'm going to source the\nvery very ugly I'm going to source the color from tilewind to make it a little\ncolor from tilewind to make it a little\ncolor from tilewind to make it a little bit nicer so uh normally I'm using\nbit nicer so uh normally I'm using\nbit nicer so uh normally I'm using colors from tailwind but now they change\ncolors from tailwind but now they change\ncolors from tailwind but now they change it to oak\nit to oak\nit to oak whatever this is this This is this does\nwhatever this is this This is this does\nwhatever this is this This is this does not work in React Native at all, but you\nnot work in React Native at all, but you\nnot work in React Native at all, but you can hold shift to have the code in hex.\ncan hold shift to have the code in hex.\ncan hold shift to have the code in hex.

And add a gap.\nAnd now if I tap it, the keyboard hides\nAnd now if I tap it, the keyboard hides my text input. So, I don't have a way to\nmy text input. So, I don't have a way to\nmy text input. So, I don't have a way to animate it, right? How how am I going to\nanimate it, right? How how am I going to\nanimate it, right? How how am I going to animate a button if it's underneath a\nanimate a button if it's underneath a\nanimate a button if it's underneath a keyboard? So, I'm going to need to use a\nkeyboard? So, I'm going to need to use a\nkeyboard? So, I'm going to need to use a keyboard controller to show it at all\nkeyboard controller to show it at all\nkeyboard controller to show it at all times.\ntimes.\ntimes. And to set up keyboard controller, I\nAnd to set up keyboard controller, I\nAnd to set up keyboard controller, I need to do one more step of\nneed to do one more step of\nneed to do one more step of installation.\ninstallation.\ninstallation. Yes, add a keyboard provider like so.\nthat's the setup. But we need to use\nthat's the setup. But we need to use uh let's use keyboard avoiding view.\nuh let's use keyboard avoiding view.\nuh let's use keyboard avoiding view. Yes, that's what I want to achieve.\nYes, that's what I want to achieve.\nYes, that's what I want to achieve. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Let's yank it really really quickly.\nAnd this as well.\nAnd this as well. And let's see if this going to work at\nAnd let's see if this going to work at\nAnd let's see if this going to work at all.\nOkay. I'm missing something. I'm missing\nOkay. I'm missing something. I'm missing some styles.\nYep.\nYep. Okay,\nOkay,\nOkay, it's a bit much, but something's work.\nit's a bit much, but something's work.\nit's a bit much, but something's work. That's good. And in a second, I'm going\nThat's good. And in a second, I'm going\nThat's good. And in a second, I'm going to animate the button.\nCan you do shared element transitions?\nCan you do shared element transitions? No. No, not yet.\nNo. No, not yet.\nNo. No, not yet. We are actively working on shared\nWe are actively working on shared\nWe are actively working on shared element transitions, but they are not on\nelement transitions, but they are not on\nelement transitions, but they are not on 4.0 just yet.

Okay, that's a bit too much.\nAnd we have keyboard animated view.\nAnd we have keyboard animated view. keyword avoiding view. Yeah. Yeah, that\nkeyword avoiding view. Yeah. Yeah, that\nkeyword avoiding view. Yeah. Yeah, that works good. Okay. So now what I want, I\nworks good. Okay. So now what I want, I\nworks good. Okay. So now what I want, I want to have the text input take the\nwant to have the text input take the\nwant to have the text input take the whole space if the keyboard is not\nwhole space if the keyboard is not\nwhole space if the keyboard is not present. Okay, this whole view. And I\npresent. Okay, this whole view. And I\npresent. Okay, this whole view. And I want to show the send button when a user\nwant to show the send button when a user\nwant to show the send button when a user focuses the input. So how I'm going to\nfocuses the input. So how I'm going to\nfocuses the input. So how I'm going to how am I going to do this? I want to\nhow am I going to do this? I want to\nhow am I going to do this? I want to have a is focused state. Okay. And based\nhave a is focused state. Okay. And based\nhave a is focused state. Okay. And based on that state, I'm going to show or hide\non that state, I'm going to show or hide\non that state, I'm going to show or hide the button.\nthe button.\nthe button. So let's add\nSo let's add\nSo let's add focused\nlike so. I don't want that. I want to\nlike so. I don't want that. I want to import react. Good. And for that for\nimport react. Good. And for that for\nimport react. Good. And for that for that animation, I'm going to use CSS\nthat animation, I'm going to use CSS\nthat animation, I'm going to use CSS transitions because they they are state\ntransitions because they they are state\ntransitions because they they are state bound. So they need to have a state\nbound. So they need to have a state\nbound. So they need to have a state change for animation.\nOkay. And I need to have\nOkay. And I need to have do I have to have a ref? No, there's a\ndo I have to have a ref? No, there's a\ndo I have to have a ref? No, there's a on focus and on blur. Yes, exactly.\non focus and on blur. Yes, exactly.\non focus and on blur. Yes, exactly. How did you get the simulator embedded\nHow did you get the simulator embedded\nHow did you get the simulator embedded in the editor? That's Raon IDE.\nin the editor? That's Raon IDE.\nin the editor? That's Raon IDE. So this part of VS Code, it also works\nSo this part of VS Code, it also works\nSo this part of VS Code, it also works in cursor. This part of the editor is\nin cursor. This part of the editor is\nin cursor. This part of the editor is Radon IDE. I can see my logs in here. I\nRadon IDE. I can see my logs in here. I\nRadon IDE. I can see my logs in here. I can change\ncan change\ncan change the appearance. Can you see it? Yeah.\nthe appearance. Can you see it? Yeah.\nthe appearance. Can you see it? Yeah. From light to dark. Change the states.\nFrom light to dark. Change the states.\nFrom light to dark. Change the states. Very useful, very handy. I can go very\nVery useful, very handy. I can go very\nVery useful, very handy. I can go very quickly to the part of code that I need\nquickly to the part of code that I need\nquickly to the part of code that I need with the emulator, the element\nwith the emulator, the element\nwith the emulator, the element inspector, like so. And I can also have\ninspector, like so. And I can also have\ninspector, like so. And I can also have uh Android here, but it's it's a bit\nuh Android here, but it's it's a bit\nuh Android here, but it's it's a bit slow to build. So I'm not going to build\nslow to build. So I'm not going to build\nslow to build. So I'm not going to build a on live stream. But yeah, this is Raid\na on live stream. But yeah, this is Raid\na on live stream. But yeah, this is Raid on IDE. But where was I? Okay. Uh state\non IDE. But where was I? Okay. Uh state\non IDE. But where was I? Okay. Uh state on blur and on focus. On focus\nchanged is focus to true. Set is focus\nchanged is focus to true. Set is focus to true. Okay. And on blur to the same.\nto true. Okay. And on blur to the same.\nto true. Okay. And on blur to the same. Okay. So I have on blur and on focus\nOkay. So I have on blur and on focus\nOkay. So I have on blur and on focus state.\nOkay. And based on that I want to move\nOkay. And based on that I want to move my button to the right or change the and\nmy button to the right or change the and\nmy button to the right or change the and change the opacity. So the first step is\nchange the opacity. So the first step is\nchange the opacity. So the first step is to make my pressable and animated\nto make my pressable and animated\nto make my pressable and animated pressable\nwith create animated component from\nwith create animated component from reanimated.\nreanimated.\nreanimated. Okay. And I'm going to use it right\nOkay. And I'm going to use it right\nOkay. And I'm going to use it right here.\nhere.\nhere. This adds a superpowers to my pressable\nThis adds a superpowers to my pressable\nThis adds a superpowers to my pressable because now I can use CSS animation, CSS\nbecause now I can use CSS animation, CSS\nbecause now I can use CSS animation, CSS transitions, and other good stuff from\ntransitions, and other good stuff from\ntransitions, and other good stuff from reanimated.\nreanimated.\nreanimated. So I'm going to change this style\nSo I'm going to change this style\nSo I'm going to change this style to add inline the transition property\nto add inline the transition property\nto add inline the transition property remember.\nAnd first I'm going to animate opacity.\nAnd first I'm going to animate opacity. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. just to showcase\njust to showcase\njust to showcase and set the transition duration. 300\nand set the transition duration. 300\nand set the transition duration. 300 millconds is fine, but I want to make it\nmillconds is fine, but I want to make it\nmillconds is fine, but I want to make it disappear\ndisappear\ndisappear and is focused. If it's focused, then\nand is focused. If it's focused, then\nand is focused. If it's focused, then it's visible. If it's not focused, it's\nit's visible. If it's not focused, it's\nit's visible. If it's not focused, it's going to disappear.\ngoing to disappear.\ngoing to disappear. And that's all it takes to animate. Do\nAnd that's all it takes to animate. Do\nAnd that's all it takes to animate. Do we need to run npx exper iOS after\nwe need to run npx exper iOS after\nwe need to run npx exper iOS after installing keyboard controller?

Uh, so no, I just opened Raidon and it built it for me.\nWhere was I? Okay, animation. Now it\nWhere was I? Okay, animation. Now it appears and disappears when I blur.\nappears and disappears when I blur.\nappears and disappears when I blur. Nice. Okay, that's cool.\nNice. Okay, that's cool.\nNice. Okay, that's cool. But I also want to make the input\nBut I also want to make the input\nBut I also want to make the input larger. when it's when it's not visible\nlarger. when it's when it's not visible\nlarger. when it's when it's not visible or the button is not visible and I'm\nor the button is not visible and I'm\nor the button is not visible and I'm going to achieve this with margin left\ngoing to achieve this with margin left\ngoing to achieve this with margin left like so I'm going to add new transition\nlike so I'm going to add new transition\nlike so I'm going to add new transition property as margin\nproperty as margin\nproperty as margin left\nleft\nleft okay and I'm going to move the button to\nokay and I'm going to move the button to\nokay and I'm going to move the button to the either right or left I believe to\nthe either right or left I believe to\nthe either right or left I believe to the right with margin\nthe right with margin\nthe right with margin yeah that's correct because I've\nyeah that's correct because I've\nyeah that's correct because I've implemented for\nimplemented for\nimplemented for No, that's that's not correct.

So that's\nI've learned something today. So that's cool.\nLet me get this back\nLet me get this back to where it was. Okay.\nto where it was. Okay.\nto where it was. Okay. Okay.\nSo it's not a first argument.\nSo it's not a first argument. Ah, okay.\nI got very sidelined of what I wanted to\nI got very sidelined of what I wanted to build.\nNo,\nNo, that does not work.\nI'm going to revert to how it was. I\nI'm going to revert to how it was. I think this this code is correctish.\nthink this this code is correctish.\nthink this this code is correctish. We haven't tried this.\nWe haven't tried this.\nWe haven't tried this. Yeah.\nMaybe because it needs this state here.\nMaybe because it needs this state here. Shame. I usually use it to simplify some\nShame. I usually use it to simplify some\nShame. I usually use it to simplify some things. Yeah. Yeah. It's It's cool. It's\nthings. Yeah. Yeah. It's It's cool. It's\nthings. Yeah. Yeah. It's It's cool. It's cool.\ncool.\ncool. It's cool. I don't know how it works\nIt's cool. I don't know how it works\nIt's cool. I don't know how it works underneath.\nunderneath.\nunderneath. Okay. Last CSS transition. And if you\nOkay. Last CSS transition. And if you\nOkay. Last CSS transition. And if you have some time, we have a little bit of\nhave some time, we have a little bit of\nhave some time, we have a little bit of time. So maybe we go to layout\ntime. So maybe we go to layout\ntime. So maybe we go to layout animations. But one more animation with\nanimations. But one more animation with\nanimations. But one more animation with CSS animations and then we can move on.\nCSS animations and then we can move on.\nCSS animations and then we can move on. So up when we send\nI'm not going to try it fourth times.\nI'm not going to try it fourth times. No, no, no. You're not correct. It was\nNo, no, no. You're not correct. It was\nNo, no, no. You're not correct. It was like that. I destructured this. It was\nlike that. I destructured this. It was\nlike that. I destructured this. It was like like this.\nanimated view\nanimated view view.\nview.\nview. Yeah, there you go.\nYeah, there you go.\nYeah, there you go. Um, and I want to have another state for\nUm, and I want to have another state for\nUm, and I want to have another state for another\nanother\nanother for another animation. And this is going\nfor another animation. And this is going\nfor another animation. And this is going to be ascending.\nNow, I'm going to I'm going to go uh to\nNow, I'm going to I'm going to go uh to the next example.\nIs sending. I'm going to set it when we\nIs sending. I'm going to set it when we press send. So when we press send it's\npress send. So when we press send it's\npress send. So when we press send it's on press\nhandle send.\nhandle send. Oh it's very broken.\nOkay. Missing this function.\nOkay. Missing this function. Good. Good with reproduction please.\nOkay.\nOkay. And set it to trending sending because\nAnd set it to trending sending because\nAnd set it to trending sending because we're going to need some more code for\nwe're going to need some more code for\nwe're going to need some more code for this to work. Uh what I want to do if\nthis to work. Uh what I want to do if\nthis to work. Uh what I want to do if it's sending I want to move it up and\nit's sending I want to move it up and\nit's sending I want to move it up and change the opacity.\nchange the opacity.\nchange the opacity. Okay. to move it up. I'm gonna use\nOkay. to move it up. I'm gonna use\nOkay. to move it up. I'm gonna use transform\ntransform\ntransform translate Y.\ntranslate Y.\ntranslate Y. This dude doesn't use cursor. I have\nThis dude doesn't use cursor. I have\nThis dude doesn't use cursor. I have copilot here. I do use agent mode from\ncopilot here. I do use agent mode from\ncopilot here. I do use agent mode from copilot, but that's basically the same\ncopilot, but that's basically the same\ncopilot, but that's basically the same stuff.\nBut thank you. assuming that reanimate\nBut thank you. assuming that reanimate overrides the part of pressable type\noverrides the part of pressable type\noverrides the part of pressable type prop with the create animated component\nprop with the create animated component\nprop with the create animated component but could probably be be supported if\nbut could probably be be supported if\nbut could probably be be supported if that's the case. Yeah, co is getting\nthat's the case. Yeah, co is getting\nthat's the case. Yeah, co is getting quite good. Yeah, I agree that might be\nquite good. Yeah, I agree that might be\nquite good. Yeah, I agree that might be the case Oscar. Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah. But for learning I want to show type out\nBut for learning I want to show type out\nBut for learning I want to show type out the code and showcase the the API.\nthe code and showcase the the API.\nthe code and showcase the the API. I do VIP code sometimes.\nI do VIP code sometimes.\nI do VIP code sometimes. um\num\num is sending. I'm going to launch it up.\nis sending. I'm going to launch it up.\nis sending. I'm going to launch it up. So that's for example 200 pixels\nSo that's for example 200 pixels\nSo that's for example 200 pixels maybe negative pixels I believe.\nmaybe negative pixels I believe.\nmaybe negative pixels I believe. No, that went the other way. I need to\nNo, that went the other way. I need to\nNo, that went the other way. I need to do it Y axis like so. Okay. So we've\ndo it Y axis like so. Okay. So we've\ndo it Y axis like so. Okay. So we've launched it up. Uh 200 millconds is\nlaunched it up. Uh 200 millconds is\nlaunched it up. Uh 200 millconds is okay. And I want to change the opacity\nokay. And I want to change the opacity\nokay. And I want to change the opacity as well.\nopacity.\nopacity. Okay.\nIf it's sending set to zero, if it's not\nIf it's sending set to zero, if it's not to one. Okay. And it disappeared. That's\nto one. Okay. And it disappeared. That's\nto one. Okay. And it disappeared. That's correct. I need to revert to sending\ncorrect. I need to revert to sending\ncorrect. I need to revert to sending false when we when we tap. So after some\nfalse when we when we tap. So after some\nfalse when we when we tap. So after some time\nflying send button. Yes. Yes. Flying\nflying send button. Yes. Yes. Flying send button. Exactly.\nsend button. Exactly.\nsend button. Exactly. Because it simulates sending, right?\nBecause it simulates sending, right?\nBecause it simulates sending, right? That's my idea.\nThat's my idea.\nThat's my idea. Set timeouts. Set sending to false.\nSet timeouts. Set sending to false.\nSet timeouts. Set sending to false. That's okay. And we will hide the\nThat's okay. And we will hide the\nThat's okay. And we will hide the keyboard in a second for a good measure.\nOh, it disappeared.\nOh, it disappeared. True.\nOkay, good. Launch it.\nOkay, good. Launch it. Okay. And when I close the keyboard,\nOkay. And when I close the keyboard,\nOkay. And when I close the keyboard, it's going to go back to where it should\nit's going to go back to where it should\nit's going to go back to where it should be. But this this actually looks good.\nAnd again, two lines of code. That's\nAnd again, two lines of code. That's perfect. But I really the keyboard to\nperfect. But I really the keyboard to\nperfect. But I really the keyboard to fulfill\nfulfill\nfulfill um the animation.\num the animation.\num the animation. So here I have a text input. I'm going\nSo here I have a text input. I'm going\nSo here I have a text input. I'm going to add a ref for it.\nto add a ref for it.\nto add a ref for it. Ref.\nRef.\nRef. Yep.\nUse ref.\nUse ref. That's correct. Import it from React.\nThat's correct. Import it from React.\nThat's correct. Import it from React. Attach it to the text input.\nAttach it to the text input.\nAttach it to the text input. Is it attached? It is already attached.\nIs it attached? It is already attached.\nIs it attached? It is already attached. Perfect. And when we send, I want to\nPerfect. And when we send, I want to\nPerfect. And when we send, I want to close it. So, ref.curren.b blur.\nclose it. So, ref.curren.b blur.\nclose it. So, ref.curren.b blur. Exactly. And I can clear whatever I had\nExactly. And I can clear whatever I had\nExactly. And I can clear whatever I had back there.\nback there.\nback there. Okay. Send.\nOkay. Send.\nOkay. Send. Uh, okay. It's not perfect\nThis is literally use animated style and\nThis is literally use animated style and shared values interplayable on steroids.\nshared values interplayable on steroids.\nshared values interplayable on steroids. It's much easier for many case for many\nIt's much easier for many case for many\nIt's much easier for many case for many cases and it does not use shared values.\ncases and it does not use shared values.\ncases and it does not use shared values. You could use shared values. Um you can\nYou could use shared values. Um you can\nYou could use shared values. Um you can mix and match CSS animation CSS\nmix and match CSS animation CSS\nmix and match CSS animation CSS transition with shared values and layout\ntransition with shared values and layout\ntransition with shared values and layout animations.\nanimations.\nanimations. Um but it does not rely on shared\nUm but it does not rely on shared\nUm but it does not rely on shared values. But yeah, it's way easier in\nvalues. But yeah, it's way easier in\nvalues. But yeah, it's way easier in just a couple lines of code.\njust a couple lines of code.\njust a couple lines of code. Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah. So I want to I want to close it nearly\nSo I want to I want to close it nearly\nSo I want to I want to close it nearly immediately and then set sending to\nimmediately and then set sending to\nimmediately and then set sending to false.\nfalse.\nfalse. Set time out again.\nSet time out again.\nSet time out again. Why not?\nWhy not?\nWhy not? 100 maybe 600.\nOkay. So that opens. It shows the\nOkay. So that opens. It shows the button. It has the scale.\nbutton. It has the scale.\nbutton. It has the scale. Yeah, that's what I wanted to have. It's\nYeah, that's what I wanted to have. It's\nYeah, that's what I wanted to have. It's perfect.\nYeah, nice.\nYeah, nice. Okay, that's cool. We have a little bit\nOkay, that's cool. We have a little bit\nOkay, that's cool. We have a little bit more time. So, I can go and show you a\nmore time. So, I can go and show you a\nmore time. So, I can go and show you a trick with uh layout animations maybe\ntrick with uh layout animations maybe\ntrick with uh layout animations maybe because I've I fell in love recently\nbecause I've I fell in love recently\nbecause I've I fell in love recently with layout animations. Uh not recently,\nwith layout animations. Uh not recently,\nwith layout animations. Uh not recently, but that's basically CSS animation CSS\nbut that's basically CSS animation CSS\nbut that's basically CSS animation CSS transitions. So, let me show you just\ntransitions. So, let me show you just\ntransitions. So, let me show you just one more trick with CSS. uh not with CSS\none more trick with CSS. uh not with CSS\none more trick with CSS. uh not with CSS with layout animations.\nwith layout animations.\nwith layout animations. So I want to when the screen first\nSo I want to when the screen first\nSo I want to when the screen first appears I want to jiggle the letters of\nappears I want to jiggle the letters of\nappears I want to jiggle the letters of Hello Casper a little bit with layout\nHello Casper a little bit with layout\nHello Casper a little bit with layout animations.\nanimations.\nanimations. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going to put Hello Casper as a string and then\nput Hello Casper as a string and then\nput Hello Casper as a string and then split it into letters. Okay?\nlike so without the space. Okay, I'm\nlike so without the space. Okay, I'm going to map over this.\nOkay, that's nearly what I wanted.\nOkay, that's nearly what I wanted. What's the mask view?

So currently\nLet's get back to this. So currently nothing has happened. Oh, it broke my\nnothing has happened. Oh, it broke my\nnothing has happened. Oh, it broke my styles, but that's okay. I'm going to\nstyles, but that's okay. I'm going to\nstyles, but that's okay. I'm going to put it as flex direction\nput it as flex direction\nput it as flex direction row\nrow\nrow and is like it was perfect.\nand is like it was perfect.\nand is like it was perfect. But now I'm going to add layout entering\nBut now I'm going to add layout entering\nBut now I'm going to add layout entering layout animation\nwith fading down.\nwith fading down. Okay,\nOkay,\nOkay, but it needs to be an animated text.\nSo layout okay nice layout animations\nSo layout okay nice layout animations animate stuff when they are added or\nanimate stuff when they are added or\nanimate stuff when they are added or removed from the react view hierarchy.\nremoved from the react view hierarchy.\nremoved from the react view hierarchy. So this is perfect use case when I want\nSo this is perfect use case when I want\nSo this is perfect use case when I want to when users first see my screen they\nto when users first see my screen they\nto when users first see my screen they have animation but let me add one more\nhave animation but let me add one more\nhave animation but let me add one more thing for this I want to delay each of\nthing for this I want to delay each of\nthing for this I want to delay each of the letter by some time. Okay. Index\nthe letter by some time. Okay. Index\nthe letter by some time. Okay. Index times\ntimes\ntimes 33 milliseconds.\nThere you go. Nice. Okay. I'm going to\nThere you go. Nice. Okay. I'm going to make a Springify\nmake a Springify\nmake a Springify and add\nand add\nand add Let's see. Let's see how it works now\nLet's see. Let's see how it works now\nLet's see. Let's see how it works now with a spring. That's a bit nicer. Yeah.\nwith a spring. That's a bit nicer. Yeah.\nwith a spring. That's a bit nicer. Yeah. And make it\nAnd make it\nAnd make it stiff. No, dumping ratio\nstiff. No, dumping ratio\nstiff. No, dumping ratio a little bit less than 10.\nOkay, that's too much. Um, 10 was okay.\nOkay, that's too much. Um, 10 was okay. No,\nmaybe mass\nmaybe mass two.\ntwo.\ntwo. Okay, that's nice.\nThat's That's nice. And we still have\nThat's That's nice. And we still have that CSS animation that's rotating the\nthat CSS animation that's rotating the\nthat CSS animation that's rotating the gradient.\nOkay, when you open the screen, you're\nOkay, when you open the screen, you're greeted with a layout animation. We have\ngreeted with a layout animation. We have\ngreeted with a layout animation. We have a text input with a CSS transition right\na text input with a CSS transition right\na text input with a CSS transition right here that's animating when you press.\nhere that's animating when you press.\nhere that's animating when you press.

We had like four different\nIt's nice. We had like four different\nIt's nice. We had like four different delay by index. Yep.\ndelay by index. Yep.\ndelay by index. Yep. We have like four different animations\nWe have like four different animations\nWe have like four different animations with like I don't know 100 lines of\nwith like I don't know 100 lines of\nwith like I don't know 100 lines of code. That's the power of reanimated 4.\ncode. That's the power of reanimated 4.\ncode. That's the power of reanimated 4. It's cool.\nWhat's the time? It's exactly an hour.\nWhat's the time? It's exactly an hour. So I think we can wrap at this. I can\nSo I think we can wrap at this. I can\nSo I think we can wrap at this. I can explain a little bit. CSS animation, CSS\nexplain a little bit. CSS animation, CSS\nexplain a little bit. CSS animation, CSS transitions.\ntransitions.\ntransitions. So you don't use CSS animations and CSS\nSo you don't use CSS animations and CSS\nSo you don't use CSS animations and CSS transitions for everything\ntransitions for everything\ntransitions for everything because there are some parts of\nbecause there are some parts of\nbecause there are some parts of animations like gestures that rely on\nanimations like gestures that rely on\nanimations like gestures that rely on shared values. So for gesture handler\nshared values. So for gesture handler\nshared values. So for gesture handler gesture handler driven animations you\ngesture handler driven animations you\ngesture handler driven animations you need to use shared values with use\nneed to use shared values with use\nneed to use shared values with use animated style to drive your animations.\nanimated style to drive your animations.\nanimated style to drive your animations. for layout animations. So like animating\nfor layout animations. So like animating\nfor layout animations. So like animating flex direction or justify content you\nflex direction or justify content you\nflex direction or justify content you need to use layout animations. And for\nneed to use layout animations. And for\nneed to use layout animations. And for animating elements between the screens\nanimating elements between the screens\nanimating elements between the screens in the future you will use shadow\nin the future you will use shadow\nin the future you will use shadow element transitions. But for many many\nelement transitions. But for many many\nelement transitions. But for many many cases that are very easy to add,\ncases that are very easy to add,\ncases that are very easy to add, very easy to maintenance because this is\nvery easy to maintenance because this is\nvery easy to maintenance because this is just two three lines of code, you can\njust two three lines of code, you can\njust two three lines of code, you can use CSS animations and CSS transitions.\nSo yeah, I will show you uh I will send\nSo yeah, I will show you uh I will send you the code on Twitter and I think we\nyou the code on Twitter and I think we\nyou the code on Twitter and I think we can Okay, let me show my face. I think\ncan Okay, let me show my face. I think\ncan Okay, let me show my face. I think we can\nwe can\nwe can uh wrap at this and there's a there's\nuh wrap at this and there's a there's\nuh wrap at this and there's a there's another actually chat app where send\nanother actually chat app where send\nanother actually chat app where send button disappears after message would\nbutton disappears after message would\nbutton disappears after message would help people that write messages one line\nhelp people that write messages one line\nhelp people that write messages one line by one. Yeah, that might be the case.\nby one. Yeah, that might be the case.\nby one. Yeah, that might be the case.

So this is like does it start faster and\nSo this is like does it start faster and\nSo this is like does it start faster and then become slower in the end or does it\nthen become slower in the end or does it\nthen become slower in the end or does it start slow and then go faster or\nstart slow and then go faster or\nstart slow and then go faster or something like this. And then we also\nsomething like this. And then we also\nsomething like this. And then we also have a transition behavior if you want\nhave a transition behavior if you want\nhave a transition behavior if you want to but that's not very commonly used and\nto but that's not very commonly used and\nto but that's not very commonly used and you don't really have to set that value.\nyou don't really have to set that value.\nyou don't really have to set that value. As a result, if we now look at this new\nAs a result, if we now look at this new\nAs a result, if we now look at this new way, it kind of looks the same. The good\nway, it kind of looks the same. The good\nway, it kind of looks the same. The good eye should already notice that there's a\neye should already notice that there's a\neye should already notice that there's a difference between this animation here\ndifference between this animation here\ndifference between this animation here and the animation we see here. That is\nand the animation we see here. That is\nand the animation we see here. That is because in the old animation with shared\nbecause in the old animation with shared\nbecause in the old animation with shared values, we were also able to use\nvalues, we were also able to use\nvalues, we were also able to use something like damping, stiffness. You\nsomething like damping, stiffness. You\nsomething like damping, stiffness. You can use values like how heavy something\ncan use values like how heavy something\ncan use values like how heavy something is that changes how things animate on\nis that changes how things animate on\nis that changes how things animate on the screen. So, it's a kind of more\nthe screen. So, it's a kind of more\nthe screen. So, it's a kind of more granular way to create animation.\ngranular way to create animation.\ngranular way to create animation. However, in many cases, that's not\nHowever, in many cases, that's not\nHowever, in many cases, that's not really required. Maybe this one is a bit\nreally required. Maybe this one is a bit\nreally required. Maybe this one is a bit boring, but overall, it gets the job\nboring, but overall, it gets the job\nboring, but overall, it gets the job done and it does so in a lot less code.\ndone and it does so in a lot less code.\ndone and it does so in a lot less code. You don't have to learn like the shared\nYou don't have to learn like the shared\nYou don't have to learn like the shared values, the hooks, and all of that. And\nvalues, the hooks, and all of that. And\nvalues, the hooks, and all of that. And web developers coming to React Native\nweb developers coming to React Native\nweb developers coming to React Native will feel familiar with this stuff. So,\nwill feel familiar with this stuff. So,\nwill feel familiar with this stuff. So, these are CSS transitions. You can now\nthese are CSS transitions. You can now\nthese are CSS transitions. You can now also use CSS animations. So, if we're\nalso use CSS animations. So, if we're\nalso use CSS animations. So, if we're going to check out a little example\ngoing to check out a little example\ngoing to check out a little example here, just something that rotates and\nhere, just something that rotates and\nhere, just something that rotates and rotates back. Okay, not too crazy, but\nrotates back. Okay, not too crazy, but\nrotates back. Okay, not too crazy, but we can create all of this with an\nwe can create all of this with an\nwe can create all of this with an animation like this. So, here again, we\nanimation like this. So, here again, we\nanimation like this. So, here again, we have an animated view and if it is\nhave an animated view and if it is\nhave an animated view and if it is rotating, we apply the CSS style rotate.\nrotating, we apply the CSS style rotate.\nrotating, we apply the CSS style rotate. Now, why is this special? For a couple\nNow, why is this special? For a couple\nNow, why is this special? For a couple of reasons. So, first we can create our\nof reasons. So, first we can create our\nof reasons. So, first we can create our animation. So, this is the animation\nanimation. So, this is the animation\nanimation. So, this is the animation name rotate. Um, this is actually the\nname rotate. Um, this is actually the\nname rotate. Um, this is actually the one up here. And you might notice that I\none up here. And you might notice that I\none up here. And you might notice that I have a CSS.create here which is coming\nhave a CSS.create here which is coming\nhave a CSS.create here which is coming from React Native Reanimated. Uh, word\nfrom React Native Reanimated. Uh, word\nfrom React Native Reanimated. Uh, word on the modularization coming in a\non the modularization coming in a\non the modularization coming in a second. For the moment, you could also\nsecond. For the moment, you could also\nsecond. For the moment, you could also do this with stylesheet and generate\ndo this with stylesheet and generate\ndo this with stylesheet and generate this. However, I think if you use um the\nthis. However, I think if you use um the\nthis. However, I think if you use um the CSS from reanimated here, you're going\nCSS from reanimated here, you're going\nCSS from reanimated here, you're going to have a safer time because uh the\nto have a safer time because uh the\nto have a safer time because uh the stylesheet might not support the\nstylesheet might not support the\nstylesheet might not support the properties in the way they should be\nproperties in the way they should be\nproperties in the way they should be supported. At least that was my initial\nsupported. At least that was my initial\nsupported. At least that was my initial feeling. So, with this code again, we\nfeeling. So, with this code again, we\nfeeling. So, with this code again, we can see that this simply does an\ncan see that this simply does an\ncan see that this simply does an animation. Uh it takes about 2 seconds.\nanimation. Uh it takes about 2 seconds.\nanimation. Uh it takes about 2 seconds. It has a 200 milliseconds delay. Uh we\nIt has a 200 milliseconds delay. Uh we\nIt has a 200 milliseconds delay. Uh we use once again a timing function ease in\nuse once again a timing function ease in\nuse once again a timing function ease in out. So you see it becomes faster and\nout. So you see it becomes faster and\nout. So you see it becomes faster and then goes slower to the end again. And\nthen goes slower to the end again. And\nthen goes slower to the end again. And we also have alternate so it rotates\nwe also have alternate so it rotates\nwe also have alternate so it rotates right and then left and it does so\nright and then left and it does so\nright and then left and it does so infinite. Now additionally we can also\ninfinite. Now additionally we can also\ninfinite. Now additionally we can also midway uh let's do this. Can we do uh we\nmidway uh let's do this. Can we do uh we\nmidway uh let's do this. Can we do uh we haven't applied this. So you could in\nhaven't applied this. So you could in\nhaven't applied this. So you could in theory also pause this uh with another\ntheory also pause this uh with another\ntheory also pause this uh with another value. So if you check out the\nvalue. So if you check out the\nvalue. So if you check out the documentation on CS animations you see\ndocumentation on CS animations you see\ndocumentation on CS animations you see uh we got all of this included. We got\nuh we got all of this included. We got\nuh we got all of this included. We got the name. We got the duration, we got\nthe name. We got the duration, we got\nthe name. We got the duration, we got the delay, we got the timing function,\nthe delay, we got the timing function,\nthe delay, we got the timing function, direction. Um, and you can now also\ndirection. Um, and you can now also\ndirection. Um, and you can now also could set the animation play state. So\ncould set the animation play state. So\ncould set the animation play state. So if we wanted to, we could probably do\nif we wanted to, we could probably do\nif we wanted to, we could probably do this in here. Uh, so if we pause, the\nthis in here. Uh, so if we pause, the\nthis in here. Uh, so if we pause, the play state will be set to pause. Let's\nplay state will be set to pause. Let's\nplay state will be set to pause. Let's see. Let's try this again.\nsee. Let's try this again.\nsee. Let's try this again. Animation start. And then I pause. So\nAnimation start. And then I pause. So\nAnimation start. And then I pause. So when I press pause, my paused value here\nwhen I press pause, my paused value here\nwhen I press pause, my paused value here will be set and the animation play state\nwill be set and the animation play state\nwill be set and the animation play state will be paused. And I can just resume\nwill be paused. And I can just resume\nwill be paused. And I can just resume this if I want to. I don't know if this\nthis if I want to. I don't know if this\nthis if I want to. I don't know if this is super helpful, but um just wanted to\nis super helpful, but um just wanted to\nis super helpful, but um just wanted to mention that it's in there because\nmention that it's in there because\nmention that it's in there because normally CSS transitions are for like\nnormally CSS transitions are for like\nnormally CSS transitions are for like regular transitions. The they're tied to\nregular transitions. The they're tied to\nregular transitions. The they're tied to state. You do them once and they're\nstate. You do them once and they're\nstate. You do them once and they're done. Animations are more like what do\ndone. Animations are more like what do\ndone. Animations are more like what do they say like fire and forget. You can't\nthey say like fire and forget. You can't\nthey say like fire and forget. You can't really control what's going on. But with\nreally control what's going on. But with\nreally control what's going on. But with the animation play state, you can kind\nthe animation play state, you can kind\nthe animation play state, you can kind of control it by at least saying, \"Hey,\nof control it by at least saying, \"Hey,\nof control it by at least saying, \"Hey, please pause here or please keep going.\"\nplease pause here or please keep going.\"\nplease pause here or please keep going.\" Now, this is really the essential part\nNow, this is really the essential part\nNow, this is really the essential part of this release. So, um this makes up\nof this release. So, um this makes up\nof this release. So, um this makes up also a big chunk of the release notes\nalso a big chunk of the release notes\nalso a big chunk of the release notes here. Looks like my animation on this\nhere. Looks like my animation on this\nhere. Looks like my animation on this page isn't even working anymore. What is\npage isn't even working anymore. What is\npage isn't even working anymore. What is going on? I can't scroll that page\ngoing on? I can't scroll that page\ngoing on? I can't scroll that page anymore. Medium, what are you built\nanymore. Medium, what are you built\nanymore. Medium, what are you built with? I don't know. Um so, start using\nwith? I don't know. Um so, start using\nwith? I don't know. Um so, start using CSS animations and transitions. There\nCSS animations and transitions. There\nCSS animations and transitions. There are many more powerful examples in the\nare many more powerful examples in the\nare many more powerful examples in the reanimated uh docs and the GitHub\nreanimated uh docs and the GitHub\nreanimated uh docs and the GitHub repository. Now, what about workloads?\nrepository. Now, what about workloads?\nrepository. Now, what about workloads? If you've used reanimated in the past,\nIf you've used reanimated in the past,\nIf you've used reanimated in the past, you know that um these things\nyou know that um these things\nyou know that um these things automatically get workletized under the\nautomatically get workletized under the\nautomatically get workletized under the hood. So that basically means um these\nhood. So that basically means um these\nhood. So that basically means um these parts of your code that change the UI\nparts of your code that change the UI\nparts of your code that change the UI run on the UI thread, not the main\nrun on the UI thread, not the main\nrun on the UI thread, not the main JavaScript thread. That makes or that is\nJavaScript thread. That makes or that is\nJavaScript thread. That makes or that is the whole logic of reanimated that these\nthe whole logic of reanimated that these\nthe whole logic of reanimated that these animations are performant running on the\nanimations are performant running on the\nanimations are performant running on the native level. Like um if you open up\nnative level. Like um if you open up\nnative level. Like um if you open up Xcode, we did this in the previous video\nXcode, we did this in the previous video\nXcode, we did this in the previous video as well. Uh so you can look under the\nas well. Uh so you can look under the\nas well. Uh so you can look under the hood of these animations and you're\nhood of these animations and you're\nhood of these animations and you're going to see that even if you use CSS\ngoing to see that even if you use CSS\ngoing to see that even if you use CSS animations that stuff will run on the\nanimations that stuff will run on the\nanimations that stuff will run on the native views in the native UI here uh in\nnative views in the native UI here uh in\nnative views in the native UI here uh in the UI layer. So worklets are now in\nthe UI layer. So worklets are now in\nthe UI layer. So worklets are now in their own package which is quite\ntheir own package which is quite\ntheir own package which is quite interesting for a couple of reason.\ninteresting for a couple of reason.\ninteresting for a couple of reason. First you now have to install this\nFirst you now have to install this\nFirst you now have to install this package additionally. If you go into the\npackage additionally. If you go into the\npackage additionally. If you go into the package JSON here, you're going to see I\npackage JSON here, you're going to see I\npackage JSON here, you're going to see I have React Native Reanimated 4 and React\nhave React Native Reanimated 4 and React\nhave React Native Reanimated 4 and React Native worklets at the latest version.\nNative worklets at the latest version.\nNative worklets at the latest version. And React Native workloads is now\nAnd React Native workloads is now\nAnd React Native workloads is now actually a standalone package. So you\nactually a standalone package. So you\nactually a standalone package. So you can see this uh from software mention\ncan see this uh from software mention\ncan see this uh from software mention you can use re react native workloads or\nyou can use re react native workloads or\nyou can use re react native workloads or you need to use them and install them\nyou need to use them and install them\nyou need to use them and install them with reanimated but you can also use\nwith reanimated but you can also use\nwith reanimated but you can also use them for many other things because if\nthem for many other things because if\nthem for many other things because if you check out the documentation uh\nyou check out the documentation uh\nyou check out the documentation uh you're going to see all these uh\nyou're going to see all these uh\nyou're going to see all these uh elements here and you can just put\nelements here and you can just put\nelements here and you can just put pretty much everything that you want on\npretty much everything that you want on\npretty much everything that you want on that UI thread and have some some more\nthat UI thread and have some some more\nthat UI thread and have some some more threading in your JavaScript application\nthreading in your JavaScript application\nthreading in your JavaScript application in your React Native application. Uh I\nin your React Native application. Uh I\nin your React Native application. Uh I think this is pretty cool and I\nthink this is pretty cool and I\nthink this is pretty cool and I definitely want to make a new video on\ndefinitely want to make a new video on\ndefinitely want to make a new video on worklets and how you could use them in\nworklets and how you could use them in\nworklets and how you could use them in the future. They're already used in apps\nthe future. They're already used in apps\nthe future. They're already used in apps like or in the uh from Micros native\nlike or in the uh from Micros native\nlike or in the uh from Micros native vision camera where you have to process\nvision camera where you have to process\nvision camera where you have to process like hundreds of frames. So you have to\nlike hundreds of frames. So you have to\nlike hundreds of frames. So you have to do this on the UI thread and process\ndo this on the UI thread and process\ndo this on the UI thread and process them with a worklet. Pretty cool stuff.\nthem with a worklet. Pretty cool stuff.\nthem with a worklet. Pretty cool stuff. And now it's a standalone package. It's\nAnd now it's a standalone package. It's\nAnd now it's a standalone package. It's extracted from the core of Reanimator\nextracted from the core of Reanimator\nextracted from the core of Reanimator which totally makes sense. Coming back\nwhich totally makes sense. Coming back\nwhich totally makes sense. Coming back to that in a second. Just uh final word\nto that in a second. Just uh final word\nto that in a second. Just uh final word on this on the worklets. Um yeah, I\non this on the worklets. Um yeah, I\non this on the worklets. Um yeah, I think we got this right. We got this.\nthink we got this right. We got this.\nthink we got this right. We got this. You can check it out on its own page. Um\nYou can check it out on its own page. Um\nYou can check it out on its own page. Um now speaking of some other things,\nnow speaking of some other things,\nnow speaking of some other things, compatibility. I already mentioned this\ncompatibility. I already mentioned this\ncompatibility. I already mentioned this in the beginning. If you want to use\nin the beginning. If you want to use\nin the beginning. If you want to use reanimated for this is new architecture\nreanimated for this is new architecture\nreanimated for this is new architecture only. That means your React Native\nonly. That means your React Native\nonly. That means your React Native application has to use the new\napplication has to use the new\napplication has to use the new architecture. If it's not using, then\narchitecture. If it's not using, then\narchitecture. If it's not using, then you still have to rely on the latest uh\nyou still have to rely on the latest uh\nyou still have to rely on the latest uh version 3 release of reanimated. But I\nversion 3 release of reanimated. But I\nversion 3 release of reanimated. But I think it's definitely worth and\nthink it's definitely worth and\nthink it's definitely worth and everyone's uh showing you these days\neveryone's uh showing you these days\neveryone's uh showing you these days that the legacy architecture is going\nthat the legacy architecture is going\nthat the legacy architecture is going away. So it's definitely time to migrate\naway. So it's definitely time to migrate\naway. So it's definitely time to migrate to the new architecture if you haven't\nto the new architecture if you haven't\nto the new architecture if you haven't done so. Additionally, there are also\ndone so. Additionally, there are also\ndone so. Additionally, there are also only a handful of versions. So\nonly a handful of versions. So\nonly a handful of versions. So reanimated 4h only works with new\nreanimated 4h only works with new\nreanimated 4h only works with new architecture and you can use uh like the\narchitecture and you can use uh like the\narchitecture and you can use uh like the last couple of versions. So from 078 to\nlast couple of versions. So from 078 to\nlast couple of versions. So from 078 to 81 these are the supported react native\n81 these are the supported react native\n81 these are the supported react native versions for reanimated. So if your app\nversions for reanimated. So if your app\nversions for reanimated. So if your app is on 075 or anything in here you can't\nis on 075 or anything in here you can't\nis on 075 or anything in here you can't use reanimated 4. You can also not\nuse reanimated 4. You can also not\nuse reanimated 4. You can also not really use the latest stuff of version\nreally use the latest stuff of version\nreally use the latest stuff of version 3. So you see the cut off here. So be\n3. So you see the cut off here. So be\n3. So you see the cut off here. So be aware of these things. Uh if you want to\naware of these things. Uh if you want to\naware of these things. Uh if you want to try the new reanimated version, probably\ntry the new reanimated version, probably\ntry the new reanimated version, probably migrate your application to a recent\nmigrate your application to a recent\nmigrate your application to a recent React Native version and the new\nReact Native version and the new\nReact Native version and the new architecture first. Then uh some other\narchitecture first. Then uh some other\narchitecture first. Then uh some other breaking changes here. We have the\nbreaking changes here. We have the\nbreaking changes here. We have the dependency on React Native work. Let's\ndependency on React Native work. Let's\ndependency on React Native work. Let's talked about this and uh you don't\ntalked about this and uh you don't\ntalked about this and uh you don't really have to do anything to your Babel\nreally have to do anything to your Babel\nreally have to do anything to your Babel plug-in if you're using Expo. They\nplug-in if you're using Expo. They\nplug-in if you're using Expo. They automatically have they changed the\nautomatically have they changed the\nautomatically have they changed the default behavior of the width spring\ndefault behavior of the width spring\ndefault behavior of the width spring animation. But if you have a custom\nanimation. But if you have a custom\nanimation. But if you have a custom animation, that's not a problem. Uh they\nanimation, that's not a problem. Uh they\nanimation, that's not a problem. Uh they removed use worklet callback because it\nremoved use worklet callback because it\nremoved use worklet callback because it was rarely used. And they also renamed I\nwas rarely used. And they also renamed I\nwas rarely used. And they also renamed I think this was a bigger one right here.\nthink this was a bigger one right here.\nthink this was a bigger one right here. They renamed use scroll view offset to\nThey renamed use scroll view offset to\nThey renamed use scroll view offset to use scroll offset. So you see some red\nuse scroll offset. So you see some red\nuse scroll offset. So you see some red lines in your application. You know why?\nlines in your application. You know why?\nlines in your application. You know why? Um besides that, nothing really else in\nUm besides that, nothing really else in\nUm besides that, nothing really else in here. Uh as I already said, they're\nhere. Uh as I already said, they're\nhere. Uh as I already said, they're working on making this more modular. So,\nworking on making this more modular. So,\nworking on making this more modular. So, in the future, I actually had a hard\nin the future, I actually had a hard\nin the future, I actually had a hard time importing this correctly. Um, I\ntime importing this correctly. Um, I\ntime importing this correctly. Um, I wanted to import the uh CSS from its own\nwanted to import the uh CSS from its own\nwanted to import the uh CSS from its own package. So, it should be add\npackage. So, it should be add\npackage. So, it should be add reanimated/css.\nreanimated/css.\nreanimated/css. I couldn't really do this yet. Maybe I\nI couldn't really do this yet. Maybe I\nI couldn't really do this yet. Maybe I have to install it separately. But if\nhave to install it separately. But if\nhave to install it separately. But if you just install the main package of\nyou just install the main package of\nyou just install the main package of reanimated like this, you're going to\nreanimated like this, you're going to\nreanimated like this, you're going to have access to everything anyway. At\nhave access to everything anyway. At\nhave access to everything anyway. At least for the moment. Maybe these\nleast for the moment. Maybe these\nleast for the moment. Maybe these changes in the future. I'm not entirely\nchanges in the future. I'm not entirely\nchanges in the future. I'm not entirely sure about this. Also, one thing for the\nsure about this. Also, one thing for the\nsure about this. Also, one thing for the future that's not included in this\nfuture that's not included in this\nfuture that's not included in this release is uh shared element\nrelease is uh shared element\nrelease is uh shared element transitions. They had a release video\ntransitions. They had a release video\ntransitions. They had a release video and they said they're working on shared\nand they said they're working on shared\nand they said they're working on shared element transitions. This will work also\nelement transitions. This will work also\nelement transitions. This will work also only with a new architecture and I've\nonly with a new architecture and I've\nonly with a new architecture and I've seen already code that works. So, be\nseen already code that works. So, be\nseen already code that works. So, be aware of that in the future. Um then\naware of that in the future. Um then\naware of that in the future. Um then regarding the animations, uh as I said\nregarding the animations, uh as I said\nregarding the animations, uh as I said before, if you include it in a\nbefore, if you include it in a\nbefore, if you include it in a stylesheet, you sometimes might\nstylesheet, you sometimes might\nstylesheet, you sometimes might encounter a problem that you're using or\nencounter a problem that you're using or\nencounter a problem that you're using or trying to use something that you\ntrying to use something that you\ntrying to use something that you remember from the web that won't work in\nremember from the web that won't work in\nremember from the web that won't work in your application. So there is in the\nyour application. So there is in the\nyour application. So there is in the documentation a table about supported\ndocumentation a table about supported\ndocumentation a table about supported style properties. Most of this, as you\nstyle properties. Most of this, as you\nstyle properties. Most of this, as you can see, is gray. Let me scroll zoom out\ncan see, is gray. Let me scroll zoom out\ncan see, is gray. Let me scroll zoom out a bit. Uh is green. Just a handful of\na bit. Uh is green. Just a handful of\na bit. Uh is green. Just a handful of red elements in there. So check this out\nred elements in there. So check this out\nred elements in there. So check this out if you want to understand why your\nif you want to understand why your\nif you want to understand why your transition or animation isn't doing what\ntransition or animation isn't doing what\ntransition or animation isn't doing what you thought it would do. But overall,\nyou thought it would do. But overall,\nyou thought it would do. But overall, there are pretty cool things possible\nthere are pretty cool things possible\nthere are pretty cool things possible with this. I actually also used exactly\nwith this. I actually also used exactly\nwith this. I actually also used exactly the same code here uh for mobile and for\nthe same code here uh for mobile and for\nthe same code here uh for mobile and for web. And I took this example from uh one\nweb. And I took this example from uh one\nweb. And I took this example from uh one of the demos I had in the previous video\nof the demos I had in the previous video\nof the demos I had in the previous video for a little campfire. So just to show\nfor a little campfire. So just to show\nfor a little campfire. So just to show you a bit bigger example. Here we go.\nyou a bit bigger example. Here we go.\nyou a bit bigger example. Here we go. our campfire running smoothly on the\nour campfire running smoothly on the\nour campfire running smoothly on the native platform as well as on the web\nnative platform as well as on the web\nnative platform as well as on the web without any code changes. So, this is\nwithout any code changes. So, this is\nwithout any code changes. So, this is pretty cool. I really love it. Um, uh,\npretty cool. I really love it. Um, uh,\npretty cool. I really love it. Um, uh, it's definitely also great to see these\nit's definitely also great to see these\nit's definitely also great to see these things here in action like CSS key\nthings here in action like CSS key\nthings here in action like CSS key frames. So, we got a couple of examples\nframes. So, we got a couple of examples\nframes. So, we got a couple of examples included that we can take a look at to\nincluded that we can take a look at to\nincluded that we can take a look at to structure our own animations and this\nstructure our own animations and this\nstructure our own animations and this will hopefully make the life for you\nwill hopefully make the life for you\nwill hopefully make the life for you easier as you transition to reanimated.\neasier as you transition to reanimated.\neasier as you transition to reanimated. All right, so Reanimated 4 looks exactly\nAll right, so Reanimated 4 looks exactly\nAll right, so Reanimated 4 looks exactly like the update to our favorite\nlike the update to our favorite\nlike the update to our favorite animation library that we needed. As\nanimation library that we needed. As\nanimation library that we needed.

Today in this tutorial I'm going to show you how we can implement\ngoing to show you how we can implement\ngoing to show you how we can implement parallax image header in React Native.\nparallax image header in React Native.\nparallax image header in React Native. So here you can see this is a detail\nSo here you can see this is a detail\nSo here you can see this is a detail screen of a product or a service. So\nscreen of a product or a service. So\nscreen of a product or a service. So here at the top we can see the image and\nhere at the top we can see the image and\nhere at the top we can see the image and with the image we can see the header\nwith the image we can see the header\nwith the image we can see the header area which is transparent and here we\narea which is transparent and here we\narea which is transparent and here we have the back button, the header title\nhave the back button, the header title\nhave the back button, the header title and the other icon which is the bookmark\nand the other icon which is the bookmark\nand the other icon which is the bookmark icon and after the image we have this\nicon and after the image we have this\nicon and after the image we have this content, the screen content. Now if I\ncontent, the screen content. Now if I\ncontent, the screen content. Now if I scroll then here you can see this is the\nscroll then here you can see this is the\nscroll then here you can see this is the parallax scrolling effect where the\nparallax scrolling effect where the\nparallax scrolling effect where the image is scrolling little bit slower and\nimage is scrolling little bit slower and\nimage is scrolling little bit slower and the content is scrolling normally and\nthe content is scrolling normally and\nthe content is scrolling normally and with the scroll here at the header we\nwith the scroll here at the header we\nwith the scroll here at the header we can see the header is becoming the solid\ncan see the header is becoming the solid\ncan see the header is becoming the solid and now it is completely visible\nand now it is completely visible\nand now it is completely visible completely solid. So this kind of\ncompletely solid. So this kind of\ncompletely solid. So this kind of parallax image header we are going to\nparallax image header we are going to\nparallax image header we are going to implement in this tutorial and we are\nimplement in this tutorial and we are\nimplement in this tutorial and we are going to do it with react native\ngoing to do it with react native\ngoing to do it with react native reanimated version 4 which is the latest\nreanimated version 4 which is the latest\nreanimated version 4 which is the latest version.

So\na new tutorial on this channel. So\na new tutorial on this channel. So without wasting any more time let's get\nwithout wasting any more time let's get\nwithout wasting any more time let's get started. Okay. So here I have created a\nstarted. Okay. So here I have created a\nstarted. Okay. So here I have created a new expo project with create expo app\nnew expo project with create expo app\nnew expo project with create expo app command and after that I have run npm\ncommand and after that I have run npm\ncommand and after that I have run npm run reset project command. So by that I\nrun reset project command. So by that I\nrun reset project command. So by that I have just this index tsx file and layout\nhave just this index tsx file and layout\nhave just this index tsx file and layout tsx file. So this is a single screen\ntsx file. So this is a single screen\ntsx file. So this is a single screen right now and this is perfectly fine for\nright now and this is perfectly fine for\nright now and this is perfectly fine for this tutorial. And here in the asset I\nthis tutorial. And here in the asset I\nthis tutorial. And here in the asset I have added this nature jpg file. Okay.\nhave added this nature jpg file. Okay.\nhave added this nature jpg file. Okay. So this is the image which I'm going to\nSo this is the image which I'm going to\nSo this is the image which I'm going to use as the header image. And with that I\nuse as the header image. And with that I\nuse as the header image. And with that I have also added another package which is\nhave also added another package which is\nhave also added another package which is expolinear gradient. So this is the\nexpolinear gradient. So this is the\nexpolinear gradient. So this is the setup. And now let's start creating the\nsetup. And now let's start creating the\nsetup. And now let's start creating the UI first. Then I'm going to implement\nUI first. Then I'm going to implement\nUI first. Then I'm going to implement the parallax effect with react native\nthe parallax effect with react native\nthe parallax effect with react native reanimated version 4. So here you can\nreanimated version 4. So here you can\nreanimated version 4. So here you can see this is version 4 and I didn't need\nsee this is version 4 and I didn't need\nsee this is version 4 and I didn't need to install it because this package comes\nto install it because this package comes\nto install it because this package comes with expo by default. But if you are\nwith expo by default. But if you are\nwith expo by default. But if you are using React Native CLI then you need to\nusing React Native CLI then you need to\nusing React Native CLI then you need to install this React Native reanimated\ninstall this React Native reanimated\ninstall this React Native reanimated package and with that also you need to\npackage and with that also you need to\npackage and with that also you need to install React Native worklets because\ninstall React Native worklets because\ninstall React Native worklets because the animations which I'm going to use\nthe animations which I'm going to use\nthe animations which I'm going to use this will work with this package. So\nthis will work with this package. So\nthis will work with this package. So this is part of the React Native\nthis is part of the React Native\nthis is part of the React Native reanimated with version 4 they have\nreanimated with version 4 they have\nreanimated with version 4 they have separated it. So you have to keep this\nseparated it. So you have to keep this\nseparated it. So you have to keep this in mind if you are using React Native\nin mind if you are using React Native\nin mind if you are using React Native CLI otherwise with Expo you don't need\nCLI otherwise with Expo you don't need\nCLI otherwise with Expo you don't need to do anything extra. This is the\nto do anything extra. This is the\nto do anything extra. This is the plug-in which is Expo linear gradient I\nplug-in which is Expo linear gradient I\nplug-in which is Expo linear gradient I have installed. Other than that I\nhave installed. Other than that I\nhave installed. Other than that I haven't installed anything for this\nhaven't installed anything for this\nhaven't installed anything for this tutorial. So now let's start creating\ntutorial. So now let's start creating\ntutorial. So now let's start creating the UI. So here first I'm going to get\nthe UI. So here first I'm going to get\nthe UI. So here first I'm going to get rid of this center and then within it\nrid of this center and then within it\nrid of this center and then within it I'm going to create a scroll view and\nI'm going to create a scroll view and\nI'm going to create a scroll view and this scroll view needs to be imported\nthis scroll view needs to be imported\nthis scroll view needs to be imported from React Native. So it have been\nfrom React Native. So it have been\nfrom React Native. So it have been imported. Now within it I'm going to\nimported. Now within it I'm going to\nimported. Now within it I'm going to provide the image and I'm going to\nprovide the image and I'm going to\nprovide the image and I'm going to provide the image with this image\nprovide the image with this image\nprovide the image with this image background component. This is also part\nbackground component. This is also part\nbackground component. This is also part of React Native. So we have imported it\nof React Native. So we have imported it\nof React Native. So we have imported it from React Native. And now let's use\nfrom React Native. And now let's use\nfrom React Native. And now let's use that. For this image background, we need\nthat. For this image background, we need\nthat. For this image background, we need to provide the image source. So here as\nto provide the image source. So here as\nto provide the image source. So here as this is the local image, we need to\nthis is the local image, we need to\nthis is the local image, we need to provide the require and within it we\nprovide the require and within it we\nprovide the require and within it we need to provide the path. So assets\nneed to provide the path. So assets\nneed to provide the path. So assets images and then we have nature.jpeg.\nimages and then we have nature.jpeg.\nimages and then we have nature.jpeg. So here we have assets images then\nSo here we have assets images then\nSo here we have assets images then within that we have nature.jpeg\nwithin that we have nature.jpeg\nwithin that we have nature.jpeg right. So that is what I have provided\nright. So that is what I have provided\nright. So that is what I have provided and after that we need to provide the\nand after that we need to provide the\nand after that we need to provide the style and for the style let's provide\nstyle and for the style let's provide\nstyle and for the style let's provide height. I will provide 300 and for the\nheight. I will provide 300 and for the\nheight. I will provide 300 and for the width I will provide 100%. Now save it.\nwidth I will provide 100%. Now save it.\nwidth I will provide 100%. Now save it. So here we can see the image right here\nSo here we can see the image right here\nSo here we can see the image right here I will create image height constant and\nI will create image height constant and\nI will create image height constant and it will be 300. So here I can provide\nit will be 300. So here I can provide\nit will be 300. So here I can provide that like this. Now after that let's\nthat like this. Now after that let's\nthat like this. Now after that let's provide a gradient effect on top of it.\nprovide a gradient effect on top of it.\nprovide a gradient effect on top of it. So that's why I have used image\nSo that's why I have used image\nSo that's why I have used image background otherwise we could have used\nbackground otherwise we could have used\nbackground otherwise we could have used image right. So here let's close it like\nimage right. So here let's close it like\nimage right. So here let's close it like this. And within it I need to provide\nthis. And within it I need to provide\nthis. And within it I need to provide the gradient. So let's import something\nthe gradient. So let's import something\nthe gradient. So let's import something from expo linear gradient and that\nfrom expo linear gradient and that\nfrom expo linear gradient and that something will be linear gradient right\nsomething will be linear gradient right\nsomething will be linear gradient right so that I can use here linear gradient\nso that I can use here linear gradient\nso that I can use here linear gradient and for the linear gradient color we can\nand for the linear gradient color we can\nand for the linear gradient color we can provide multiple colors like this and\nprovide multiple colors like this and\nprovide multiple colors like this and let's provide this style and here for\nlet's provide this style and here for\nlet's provide this style and here for this style I will provide this style I\nthis style I will provide this style I\nthis style I will provide this style I don't need this children and here I\ndon't need this children and here I\ndon't need this children and here I don't need this height instead I will\ndon't need this height instead I will\ndon't need this height instead I will use bottom become zero. Okay. Now let's\nuse bottom become zero. Okay. Now let's\nuse bottom become zero. Okay. Now let's save it. So after saving here you can\nsave it. So after saving here you can\nsave it. So after saving here you can see we have this gradient effect. Right.\nsee we have this gradient effect. Right.\nsee we have this gradient effect. Right. But I don't need this gradient effect\nBut I don't need this gradient effect\nBut I don't need this gradient effect like this. I want this black to be at\nlike this. I want this black to be at\nlike this. I want this black to be at the top. And I want to control it in a\nthe top. And I want to control it in a\nthe top. And I want to control it in a bit. So let me show it to you. If I\nbit. So let me show it to you. If I\nbit. So let me show it to you. If I change it from here to here then it will\nchange it from here to here then it will\nchange it from here to here then it will be like this. But I don't want it like\nbe like this. But I don't want it like\nbe like this. But I don't want it like this. I want to customize it a bit. So\nthis. I want to customize it a bit. So\nthis. I want to customize it a bit. So we can control it like this. So I can\nwe can control it like this. So I can\nwe can control it like this. So I can provide another color here and here the\nprovide another color here and here the\nprovide another color here and here the transparency I will provide 0.3. Now\ntransparency I will provide 0.3. Now\ntransparency I will provide 0.3. Now save it. So this is how I want it. So\nsave it. So this is how I want it. So\nsave it. So this is how I want it. So without it it is like this. Okay. And\nwithout it it is like this. Okay. And\nwithout it it is like this. Okay. And with it it is like this. So there is a\nwith it it is like this. So there is a\nwith it it is like this. So there is a slight change and we can customize it as\nslight change and we can customize it as\nslight change and we can customize it as per our requirement. Okay. So this is\nper our requirement. Okay. So this is\nper our requirement. Okay. So this is how we can provide the linear gradient\nhow we can provide the linear gradient\nhow we can provide the linear gradient here. And then after the image\nhere. And then after the image\nhere. And then after the image background let's create a view. And\nbackground let's create a view. And\nbackground let's create a view. And within the view, let's create the title.\nwithin the view, let's create the title.\nwithin the view, let's create the title. And here, let's import the text from\nAnd here, let's import the text from\nAnd here, let's import the text from React Native. So here is the item title.\nReact Native. So here is the item title.\nReact Native. So here is the item title. And then let's provide item description\nAnd then let's provide item description\nAnd then let's provide item description like this. And here for this view style,\nlike this. And here for this view style,\nlike this. And here for this view style, let's provide some padding. And let's\nlet's provide some padding. And let's\nlet's provide some padding. And let's provide some height here. So random\nprovide some height here. So random\nprovide some height here. So random height, let's provide 500. Okay? So that\nheight, let's provide 500. Okay? So that\nheight, let's provide 500. Okay? So that we can scroll it properly, right? And\nwe can scroll it properly, right? And\nwe can scroll it properly, right? And let me increase the font size of it like\nlet me increase the font size of it like\nlet me increase the font size of it like this. Yeah. And for this style, let's\nthis. Yeah. And for this style, let's\nthis. Yeah. And for this style, let's provide. Okay. So now it's looking good.\nprovide. Okay. So now it's looking good.\nprovide. Okay. So now it's looking good. And instead of item description, let's\nAnd instead of item description, let's\nAnd instead of item description, let's provide some dummy text. Okay. So yeah,\nprovide some dummy text. Okay. So yeah,\nprovide some dummy text. Okay. So yeah, it's looking good. Now let's customize\nit's looking good. Now let's customize\nit's looking good. Now let's customize the header. And to do that, we can use\nthe header. And to do that, we can use\nthe header. And to do that, we can use stack from export router. So first we\nstack from export router. So first we\nstack from export router. So first we need to wrap it with React fragment. And\nneed to wrap it with React fragment. And\nneed to wrap it with React fragment. And then we can import stack from export\nthen we can import stack from export\nthen we can import stack from export router. So here it have been changed but\nrouter. So here it have been changed but\nrouter. So here it have been changed but we don't want it. We want to provide\nwe don't want it. We want to provide\nwe don't want it. We want to provide header transparent as true. So with that\nheader transparent as true. So with that\nheader transparent as true. So with that you can see that the header is literally\nyou can see that the header is literally\nyou can see that the header is literally gone but you can see the text right. So\ngone but you can see the text right. So\ngone but you can see the text right. So header is not actually gone. It it\nheader is not actually gone. It it\nheader is not actually gone. It it becomes transparent and whatever the\nbecomes transparent and whatever the\nbecomes transparent and whatever the content we have on the screen that\ncontent we have on the screen that\ncontent we have on the screen that pushed to the top. So now we can\npushed to the top. So now we can\npushed to the top. So now we can customize the header. So here let's\ncustomize the header. So here let's\ncustomize the header. So here let's provide header left and here I will\nprovide header left and here I will\nprovide header left and here I will provide icon first. Let's provide the\nprovide icon first. Let's provide the\nprovide icon first. Let's provide the touchable opacity because it will be a\ntouchable opacity because it will be a\ntouchable opacity because it will be a button which is not functional here but\nbutton which is not functional here but\nbutton which is not functional here but this is how the button should be. So\nthis is how the button should be. So\nthis is how the button should be. So that's why I have created it. Now I need\nthat's why I have created it. Now I need\nthat's why I have created it. Now I need to provide the icon and that's why I\nto provide the icon and that's why I\nto provide the icon and that's why I need to import ionicon from vector\nneed to import ionicon from vector\nneed to import ionicon from vector icons. So I don't need ions. I needons.\nicons. So I don't need ions. I needons.\nicons. So I don't need ions. I needons. And for the name of it, I will provide\nAnd for the name of it, I will provide\nAnd for the name of it, I will provide arrow back. And for the size, let's\narrow back. And for the size, let's\narrow back. And for the size, let's provide this. So yeah, that's how it is.\nprovide this. So yeah, that's how it is.\nprovide this. So yeah, that's how it is. Let's change it to 30 to make it little\nLet's change it to 30 to make it little\nLet's change it to 30 to make it little bigger. Now after that, let's copy it\nbigger. Now after that, let's copy it\nbigger. Now after that, let's copy it again. And this time it will be header.\nagain. And this time it will be header.\nagain. And this time it will be header. Right? And here let's provide another\nRight? And here let's provide another\nRight? And here let's provide another icon which is bookmark outline. Okay. So\nicon which is bookmark outline. Okay. So\nicon which is bookmark outline. Okay. So now it's looking good. And here for the\nnow it's looking good. And here for the\nnow it's looking good. And here for the text also I have provided white color.\ntext also I have provided white color.\ntext also I have provided white color. So that's how it is. So the design is\nSo that's how it is. So the design is\nSo that's how it is. So the design is complete. Now let's implement the\ncomplete. Now let's implement the\ncomplete. Now let's implement the parallax effect. So now to implement the\nparallax effect. So now to implement the\nparallax effect. So now to implement the parallax effect we need to first convert\nparallax effect we need to first convert\nparallax effect we need to first convert this scroll view to animated scroll\nthis scroll view to animated scroll\nthis scroll view to animated scroll view. And for that we need to use\nview. And for that we need to use\nview. And for that we need to use animated from react native reanimated.\nanimated from react native reanimated.\nanimated from react native reanimated. So we need to import it. Import animated\nSo we need to import it. Import animated\nSo we need to import it. Import animated from react native reanimated. Okay. So\nfrom react native reanimated. Okay. So\nfrom react native reanimated. Okay. So it is animated scroll view and it is\nit is animated scroll view and it is\nit is animated scroll view and it is closed over here right and here we can\nclosed over here right and here we can\nclosed over here right and here we can see that animated then we have these\nsee that animated then we have these\nsee that animated then we have these components available we have image\ncomponents available we have image\ncomponents available we have image scroll view text view flat list right\nscroll view text view flat list right\nscroll view text view flat list right but here for this image we have used\nbut here for this image we have used\nbut here for this image we have used image background but with animated we\nimage background but with animated we\nimage background but with animated we can use image but not the image\ncan use image but not the image\ncan use image but not the image background so that's why I need to\nbackground so that's why I need to\nbackground so that's why I need to create another view which would be the\ncreate another view which would be the\ncreate another view which would be the animated view and within this I will\nanimated view and within this I will\nanimated view and within this I will provide this image background. Okay. So\nprovide this image background. Okay. So\nprovide this image background. Okay. So here let's provide the style for this.\nhere let's provide the style for this.\nhere let's provide the style for this. Here I will provide the height image\nHere I will provide the height image\nHere I will provide the height image height and here for this height I will\nheight and here for this height I will\nheight and here for this height I will provide 100%. Now let's save it. So\nprovide 100%. Now let's save it. So\nprovide 100%. Now let's save it. So nothing changes. Now we need to create a\nnothing changes. Now we need to create a\nnothing changes. Now we need to create a reference. So here let's create scroll\nreference. So here let's create scroll\nreference. So here let's create scroll ref and we can create it by use animated\nref and we can create it by use animated\nref and we can create it by use animated ref. And this use animated ref is also\nref. And this use animated ref is also\nref. And this use animated ref is also imported from react native reanimated.\nimported from react native reanimated.\nimported from react native reanimated. And here let's provide type. So it would\nAnd here let's provide type. So it would\nAnd here let's provide type. So it would be animated scroll view. This is the\nbe animated scroll view. This is the\nbe animated scroll view. This is the type of it. And we need to provide this\ntype of it. And we need to provide this\ntype of it. And we need to provide this reference here for this scroll view. So\nreference here for this scroll view. So\nreference here for this scroll view. So I have provided it. Now after that let's\nI have provided it. Now after that let's\nI have provided it. Now after that let's create scroll offset. And we can get the\ncreate scroll offset. And we can get the\ncreate scroll offset. And we can get the scroll offset by use scroll offset hook\nscroll offset by use scroll offset hook\nscroll offset by use scroll offset hook from React Native reanimated. And here\nfrom React Native reanimated. And here\nfrom React Native reanimated. And here we need to provide the reference. Okay.\nwe need to provide the reference. Okay.\nwe need to provide the reference. Okay. So by this whenever we scroll we would\nSo by this whenever we scroll we would\nSo by this whenever we scroll we would get that offset value over here. Now we\nget that offset value over here. Now we\nget that offset value over here. Now we need to provide some style and that\nneed to provide some style and that\nneed to provide some style and that style we need to create by using use\nstyle we need to create by using use\nstyle we need to create by using use animated style hook from React Native\nanimated style hook from React Native\nanimated style hook from React Native reanimated. So here let's create con\nreanimated. So here let's create con\nreanimated. So here let's create con image animation style. And here it would\nimage animation style. And here it would\nimage animation style. And here it would be use animated style. This needs to be\nbe use animated style. This needs to be\nbe use animated style. This needs to be imported from react native reanimated.\nimported from react native reanimated.\nimported from react native reanimated. And here we need to return transform\nAnd here we need to return transform\nAnd here we need to return transform translate y. That is correct. But here\ntranslate y. That is correct. But here\ntranslate y. That is correct. But here we need to provide interpolate. And this\nwe need to provide interpolate. And this\nwe need to provide interpolate. And this interpolate is also imported from react\ninterpolate is also imported from react\ninterpolate is also imported from react native reanimated. And here we can\nnative reanimated. And here we can\nnative reanimated. And here we can provide the value. So here we can\nprovide the value. So here we can\nprovide the value. So here we can provide the value which is the scroll\nprovide the value which is the scroll\nprovide the value which is the scroll offset value. Then we need to provide\noffset value. Then we need to provide\noffset value. Then we need to provide input range output range. So let's\ninput range output range. So let's\ninput range output range. So let's provide scroll offset value. Then for\nprovide scroll offset value. Then for\nprovide scroll offset value. Then for the input range I will provide minus\nthe input range I will provide minus\nthe input range I will provide minus image height zero then image height and\nimage height zero then image height and\nimage height zero then image height and for the output range I will provide\nfor the output range I will provide\nfor the output range I will provide image height by 2 0 it will be minus\nimage height by 2 0 it will be minus\nimage height by 2 0 it will be minus image height by 2 0 and then image\nimage height by 2 0 and then image\nimage height by 2 0 and then image height multiplied by 0.75. So now let's\nheight multiplied by 0.75. So now let's\nheight multiplied by 0.75. So now let's provide that image animation style for\nprovide that image animation style for\nprovide that image animation style for the image and here the image is not\nthe image and here the image is not\nthe image and here the image is not animated this view is. So here we can\nanimated this view is. So here we can\nanimated this view is. So here we can provide that. Let's provide it like this\nprovide that. Let's provide it like this\nprovide that. Let's provide it like this image animation style. Now save it. Now\nimage animation style. Now save it. Now\nimage animation style. Now save it. Now after that let's see. So this is how it\nafter that let's see. So this is how it\nafter that let's see. So this is how it is working right. So here we need to\nis working right. So here we need to\nis working right. So here we need to provide the background for this view. So\nprovide the background for this view. So\nprovide the background for this view. So here let's provide the background color\nhere let's provide the background color\nhere let's provide the background color white. Okay. So now we have this\nwhite. Okay. So now we have this\nwhite. Okay. So now we have this parallax effect which is the image is\nparallax effect which is the image is\nparallax effect which is the image is scrolling little bit slower and the\nscrolling little bit slower and the\nscrolling little bit slower and the bottom section the content section is\nbottom section the content section is\nbottom section the content section is scrolling at higher speed. Right now\nscrolling at higher speed. Right now\nscrolling at higher speed. Right now here when we are scrolling down\nhere when we are scrolling down\nhere when we are scrolling down especially for iOS it is like this\nespecially for iOS it is like this\nespecially for iOS it is like this rubber band effect over here and for\nrubber band effect over here and for\nrubber band effect over here and for this effect I don't want this blank area\nthis effect I don't want this blank area\nthis effect I don't want this blank area to be present like this. So that we need\nto be present like this. So that we need\nto be present like this. So that we need to provide something and for that I can\nto provide something and for that I can\nto provide something and for that I can provide scaling. For this scale here\nprovide scaling. For this scale here\nprovide scaling. For this scale here also I have provided interpolate\nalso I have provided interpolate\nalso I have provided interpolate function and here the value is scroll\nfunction and here the value is scroll\nfunction and here the value is scroll offset and for the input range I have\noffset and for the input range I have\noffset and for the input range I have provided minus image height zero then\nprovided minus image height zero then\nprovided minus image height zero then plus image height image height and then\nplus image height image height and then\nplus image height image height and then this this would be two times of the\nthis this would be two times of the\nthis this would be two times of the image size then one then one. So let me\nimage size then one then one. So let me\nimage size then one then one. So let me save it and show it to you. So when we\nsave it and show it to you. So when we\nsave it and show it to you. So when we are scrolling down that time the image\nare scrolling down that time the image\nare scrolling down that time the image is getting bigger. So that is the two\nis getting bigger. So that is the two\nis getting bigger. So that is the two times of the image. Okay. When it is\ntimes of the image. Okay. When it is\ntimes of the image. Okay. When it is normal then one and when we are\nnormal then one and when we are\nnormal then one and when we are scrolling up then also it is normal\nscrolling up then also it is normal\nscrolling up then also it is normal which is one. Right? So that is the\nwhich is one. Right? So that is the\nwhich is one. Right? So that is the scrolling effect what we have done.\nscrolling effect what we have done.\nscrolling effect what we have done. Right? Now let me increase the height\nRight? Now let me increase the height\nRight? Now let me increase the height little bit.\nOkay. So now here we need to provide\nOkay. So now here we need to provide that header effect. So let's create\nthat header effect. So let's create\nthat header effect. So let's create header animation style and here also it\nheader animation style and here also it\nheader animation style and here also it would be use animated style and here we\nwould be use animated style and here we\nwould be use animated style and here we need to provide the opacity. So right\nneed to provide the opacity. So right\nneed to provide the opacity. So right now it is completely opaque but when we\nnow it is completely opaque but when we\nnow it is completely opaque but when we are going to scroll up that time we want\nare going to scroll up that time we want\nare going to scroll up that time we want it to be visible right. So see how we\nit to be visible right. So see how we\nit to be visible right. So see how we can provide that and here we can provide\ncan provide that and here we can provide\ncan provide that and here we can provide that with header background and here for\nthat with header background and here for\nthat with header background and here for the header background we can provide a\nthe header background we can provide a\nthe header background we can provide a view and for the header height I will\nview and for the header height I will\nview and for the header height I will provide 100. Okay. So here let's close\nprovide 100. Okay. So here let's close\nprovide 100. Okay. So here let's close this for a while. So that's how it will\nthis for a while. So that's how it will\nthis for a while. So that's how it will display when we will scroll up. So that\ndisplay when we will scroll up. So that\ndisplay when we will scroll up. So that is the header background and this needs\nis the header background and this needs\nis the header background and this needs to be animated view so that we can\nto be animated view so that we can\nto be animated view so that we can control. Okay. So here I need that\ncontrol. Okay. So here I need that\ncontrol. Okay. So here I need that header animation style and let me change\nheader animation style and let me change\nheader animation style and let me change this view to animated view so that I can\nthis view to animated view so that I can\nthis view to animated view so that I can provide this header animation style and\nprovide this header animation style and\nprovide this header animation style and here we need to return opacity. So here\nhere we need to return opacity. So here\nhere we need to return opacity. So here for the interpolate we have this scroll\nfor the interpolate we have this scroll\nfor the interpolate we have this scroll offset value and here for the input\noffset value and here for the input\noffset value and here for the input range we will have from zero to image\nrange we will have from zero to image\nrange we will have from zero to image height 0 to 1. Okay. So opacity 0 to 1\nheight 0 to 1. Okay. So opacity 0 to 1\nheight 0 to 1. Okay. So opacity 0 to 1 whenever we scroll image height then it\nwhenever we scroll image height then it\nwhenever we scroll image height then it will zero opacity to one. So let's\nwill zero opacity to one. So let's\nwill zero opacity to one. So let's provide that style here. Now after\nprovide that style here. Now after\nprovide that style here. Now after saving here we can see it is looking as\nsaving here we can see it is looking as\nsaving here we can see it is looking as before. Now let's scroll. So when we are\nbefore. Now let's scroll. So when we are\nbefore. Now let's scroll. So when we are scrolling that time we can see that this\nscrolling that time we can see that this\nscrolling that time we can see that this is how it is getting its opacity back.\nis how it is getting its opacity back.\nis how it is getting its opacity back. This is how it is becoming the complete\nThis is how it is becoming the complete\nThis is how it is becoming the complete header. Right? But here we can see that\nheader. Right? But here we can see that\nheader. Right? But here we can see that it is still visible so that we can\nit is still visible so that we can\nit is still visible so that we can customize here. So here I have provided\ncustomize here. So here I have provided\ncustomize here. So here I have provided the input range zero to image height. So\nthe input range zero to image height. So\nthe input range zero to image height. So whenever we are completing the image\nwhenever we are completing the image\nwhenever we are completing the image height that time it is providing this\nheight that time it is providing this\nheight that time it is providing this one value for the opacity that I don't\none value for the opacity that I don't\none value for the opacity that I don't want. I want it to provide this one\nwant. I want it to provide this one\nwant. I want it to provide this one value for the opacity before when we\nvalue for the opacity before when we\nvalue for the opacity before when we will reach here around this position. So\nwill reach here around this position. So\nwill reach here around this position. So let's provide that. So here let's see.\nlet's provide that. So here let's see.\nlet's provide that. So here let's see. Okay. So now I think it is looking good.\nOkay. So now I think it is looking good.\nOkay. So now I think it is looking good. Yeah. So we are not seeing this. It is\nYeah. So we are not seeing this. It is\nYeah. So we are not seeing this. It is completely the solid color when we reach\ncompletely the solid color when we reach\ncompletely the solid color when we reach at this point. Right. So that's how it\nat this point. Right. So that's how it\nat this point. Right. So that's how it is. And here for this item title let's\nis. And here for this item title let's\nis. And here for this item title let's not provide the home. Let's provide the\nnot provide the home. Let's provide the\nnot provide the home. Let's provide the item title because this would be details\nitem title because this would be details\nitem title because this would be details screen for some product or service. So\nscreen for some product or service. So\nscreen for some product or service. So this is how it would be right and by\nthis is how it would be right and by\nthis is how it would be right and by clicking on this button it would go back\nclicking on this button it would go back\nclicking on this button it would go back to the home screen. So that's how it is.\nto the home screen. So that's how it is.\nto the home screen. So that's how it is. So this is the tutorial. I think you\nSo this is the tutorial.

on\nonstart onactive on end and so on now that we remember the position we\nnow that we remember the position we\nnow that we remember the position we simply added to the translation values\nsimply added to the translation values\nsimply added to the translation values and now our cards should translate\nand now our cards should translate\nand now our cards should translate nicely\nfinally when the gesture ends we need to\nfinally when the gesture ends we need to snap the card either to the left right\nsnap the card either to the left right\nsnap the card either to the left right or back to the middle redash provides us\nor back to the middle redash provides us\nor back to the middle redash provides us with a nice function named snap point to\nwith a nice function named snap point to\nwith a nice function named snap point to tell us where to snap the card when\ntell us where to snap the card when\ntell us where to snap the card when releasing the gesture\nreleasing the gesture\nreleasing the gesture and we can simply spring to that snap\nand we can simply spring to that snap\nand we can simply spring to that snap point destination\npoint destination\npoint destination for the y-axis we can always snap back\nfor the y-axis we can always snap back\nfor the y-axis we can always snap back to zero now let's jump into vs code i\nto zero now let's jump into vs code i\nto zero now let's jump into vs code i have a boilerplate project which you can\nhave a boilerplate project which you can\nhave a boilerplate project which you can download in the video description in\ndownload in the video description in\ndownload in the video description in case you want to code along with me and\ncase you want to code along with me and\ncase you want to code along with me and i think the first thing we're going to\ni think the first thing we're going to\ni think the first thing we're going to do is to wrap\ndo is to wrap\ndo is to wrap the card component to have a\nthe card component to have a\nthe card component to have a pan gesture handler and we're going to\npan gesture handler and we're going to\npan gesture handler and we're going to add a translation on the x and y axis\nadd a translation on the x and y axis\nadd a translation on the x and y axis so here i have the view which i can wrap\nso here i have the view which i can wrap\nso here i have the view which i can wrap with a\nwith a\nwith a pen gesture handler from\npen gesture handler from\npen gesture handler from react native\nreact native\nreact native gesture handler\nand the first and unique child of a\nand the first and unique child of a punjab character needs to be\npunjab character needs to be\npunjab character needs to be an animated\nan animated\nan animated view\nview\nview from reanimated2\nso probably need to import it here\nso probably need to import it here up\nup\nup so i want the one from reanimated\ni appear to have us any\ni appear to have us any view\nview\nview okay\nokay\nokay and we can add\nand we can add\nand we can add our animated gesture handler so on\nour animated gesture handler so on\nour animated gesture handler so on gesture event\ngesture event\ngesture event and we're going to create our\nand we're going to create our\nand we're going to create our animated gesture handler\nanimated gesture handler\nanimated gesture handler so on gesture event use animated\nso on gesture event use animated\nso on gesture event use animated gesture under\nnow i'm going to create two animation\nnow i'm going to create two animation values one\nvalues one\nvalues one for the translation x and one from the\nfor the translation x and one from the\nfor the translation x and one from the translation y\ntranslation y\ntranslation y so i can create x is use\nso i can create x is use\nso i can create x is use shared value\non active\non active we get\nwe get\nwe get the translation\nx and y\nx and y and we can assign it to the x and y\nand we can assign it to the x and y\nand we can assign it to the x and y animation value so x that value equals\nanimation value so x that value equals\nanimation value so x that value equals translation x and\ntranslation x and\ntranslation x and y dot value equals translation y\ny dot value equals translation y\ny dot value equals translation y now we need to apply these values to the\nnow we need to apply these values to the\nnow we need to apply these values to the style so via transform\nstyle so via transform\nstyle so via transform so we're going to create an animated\nso we're going to create an animated\nso we're going to create an animated style\nstyle\nstyle use animated style\nwe're going to return a transform and\nwe're going to return a transform and here for now we're going to add\nhere for now we're going to add\nhere for now we're going to add translate x so equals x dot value\ntranslate x so equals x dot value\ntranslate x so equals x dot value and translate y equals y dot value\nand translate y equals y dot value\nand translate y equals y dot value and i can assign\nso now i can translate the card nicely\nso now i can translate the card nicely but if i see you see if i start the\nbut if i see you see if i start the\nbut if i see you see if i start the gesture again\ngesture again\ngesture again because translation x and translation y\nbecause translation x and translation y\nbecause translation x and translation y always starts at zero it always goes\nalways starts at zero it always goes\nalways starts at zero it always goes back to zero\nback to zero\nback to zero so we need to remember\nso we need to remember\nso we need to remember the position when we start the gesture\nthe position when we start the gesture\nthe position when we start the gesture and this is where we're going to use the\nand this is where we're going to use the\nand this is where we're going to use the context\ncontext\ncontext from the gesture handler where we can\nfrom the gesture handler where we can\nfrom the gesture handler where we can keep states across different state of\nkeep states across different state of\nkeep states across different state of the gesture\nthe gesture\nthe gesture so on start\nand save the x and y value so x equals x\nand save the x and y value so x equals x dot value\nand y equals y dot value\nand y equals y dot value now i can add the type for it here so\nnow i can add the type for it here so\nnow i can add the type for it here so the first\nthe first\nthe first generic parameter here is going to be\ngeneric parameter here is going to be\ngeneric parameter here is going to be which type of gesture it is so here is\nwhich type of gesture it is so here is\nwhich type of gesture it is so here is spanish handler and here in the second\nspanish handler and here in the second\nspanish handler and here in the second generic parameter i can type\ngeneric parameter i can type\ngeneric parameter i can type the context and so my context\nthe context and so my context\nthe context and so my context is very simple i have x and y value\nall right\nall right so here i remember the values\nso here i remember the values\nso here i remember the values i can keep this state\ni can keep this state\ni can keep this state in on active\nin on active\nin on active so across different\nso across different\nso across different state of the gesture i can access the\nstate of the gesture i can access the\nstate of the gesture i can access the object so i'm simply going to add\nobject so i'm simply going to add\nobject so i'm simply going to add this value to translation x and\nthis value to translation x and\nthis value to translation x and translation\ntranslation\ntranslation y here i'm moving the card around i\ny here i'm moving the card around i\ny here i'm moving the card around i release\nrelease\nrelease and when i start against the gesture it\nand when i start against the gesture it\nand when i start against the gesture it remembers where it was\nremembers where it was\nremembers where it was so it moves nicely\nso it moves nicely\nso it moves nicely now when we need to release the gesture\nnow when we need to release the gesture\nnow when we need to release the gesture we need to snap either back to the\nwe need to snap either back to the\nwe need to snap either back to the middle or to the left or to the right\nmiddle or to the left or to the right\nmiddle or to the left or to the right so we're going to create a variable\nso we're going to create a variable\nso we're going to create a variable called destination\ncalled destination\ncalled destination so we need the x dot value we need the\nso we need the x dot value we need the\nso we need the x dot value we need the velocity so i need velocity x and\nvelocity so i need velocity x and\nvelocity so i need velocity x and velocity y\nvelocity y\nvelocity y in here we're going to use velocity x\nin here we're going to use velocity x\nin here we're going to use velocity x and we need the list of snap points\nand we need the list of snap points\nand we need the list of snap points so if we go\nso if we go\nso if we go look at the list of snap points here i\nlook at the list of snap points here i\nlook at the list of snap points here i used\nused\nused the wheel of the screen which is way too\nthe wheel of the screen which is way too\nthe wheel of the screen which is way too big\nbig\nbig it's actually\nit's actually\nit's actually um\num\num let me call it maybe side\nso side we could do\nso side we could do half of the weave maybe i can just\nhalf of the weave maybe i can just\nhalf of the weave maybe i can just rename this one here\nrename this one here\nrename this one here so half\nso half\nso half of the width and half of the weave of\nof the width and half of the weave of\nof the width and half of the weave of the card\nthe card\nthe card because the origin is the center of the\nbecause the origin is the center of the\nbecause the origin is the center of the card so\ncard so\ncard so here i have card weave\nhere i have card weave\nhere i have card weave so i could do card with divided by two i\nso i could do card with divided by two i\nso i could do card with divided by two i would be\nso we go minus plus side r0\nso we go minus plus side r0 that looks\nthat looks\nthat looks good let's have a look\ngood let's have a look\ngood let's have a look so here we have the destination we can\nso here we have the destination we can\nso here we have the destination we can spring to a destination\nspring to a destination\nspring to a destination so with the spring\nto destination and we can use the\nto destination and we can use the velocity in the configuration\nand for y we always go to zero so we've\nand for y we always go to zero so we've spring to zero and we can use velocity y\ni move the card around\ni move the card around so here the snap point is not correct\nso the weave of the screen\nso the weave of the screen may not the weave of the card\nmay not the weave of the card\nmay not the weave of the card no it's plus the width of the card\nno it's plus the width of the card\nno it's plus the width of the card divided by two\ndivided by two\ndivided by two so here i snap back to the center and if\nso here i snap back to the center and if\nso here i snap back to the center and if i go left\ni go left\ni go left so it's\nso it's\nso it's not the\nnot the\nnot the minus the way of the card but plus the\nminus the way of the card but plus the\nminus the way of the card but plus the width of the card divided by two\nso up back to the middle and let's go to\nso up back to the middle and let's go to the side\nthe side\nthe side perfect\nso here we see the\nso here we see the [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] bouncing appear on the left and right\nbouncing appear on the left and right\nbouncing appear on the left and right so i think we're going to add\nso i think we're going to add\nso i think we're going to add some padding to this maybe 50\nsome padding to this maybe 50\nsome padding to this maybe 50 50 points\n50 points\n50 points let's see\nlet's see\nlet's see um\num\num so that actually\nso that actually\nso that actually looks good now what i would like to do\nlooks good now what i would like to do\nlooks good now what i would like to do is to add the rotation\nis to add the rotation\nis to add the rotation on the x and z axis\non the x and z axis\non the x and z axis and we can\nand we can\nand we can add the\nadd the\nadd the [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] x rotation because it's fixed maybe\nx rotation because it's fixed maybe\nx rotation because it's fixed maybe let's say 30 degrees\nlet's say 30 degrees\nlet's say 30 degrees so rotate z equals\nso rotate z equals\nso rotate z equals 30 degrees\nand you see it looks squished\nand you see it looks squished because we didn't add the perspective\nbecause we didn't add the perspective\nbecause we didn't add the perspective so we can add some perspective value\nso we can add some perspective value\nso we can add some perspective value here you can pick look at whatever feels\nhere you can pick look at whatever feels\nhere you can pick look at whatever feels good to you\ngood to you\ngood to you so this this looks good\nso this this looks good\nso this this looks good and what we can do\nand what we can do\nand what we can do so we're going to add the scale\nso we're going to add the scale\nso we're going to add the scale transform but first maybe let me do the\ntransform but first maybe let me do the\ntransform but first maybe let me do the rotate\nrotate\nrotate z\nz\nz so we're going to add a rotate z value\nand we want a random value between\nand we want a random value between let's say minus 10 degrees or between\nlet's say minus 10 degrees or between\nlet's say minus 10 degrees or between minus 10 to 10 degrees\nminus 10 to 10 degrees\nminus 10 to 10 degrees so we have map random\nso we have map random\nso we have map random that goes from zero to one\nthat goes from zero to one\nthat goes from zero to one so we go we want it to go from zero to\nso we go we want it to go from zero to\nso we go we want it to go from zero to 20\n20\n20 so we multiply by 20 and then we remove\nso we multiply by 20 and then we remove\nso we multiply by 20 and then we remove 10\n10\n10 to go from minus 10 to\nto go from minus 10 to\nto go from minus 10 to 10.\n10.\n10. right we go from 0 to 20 and if we\nright we go from 0 to 20 and if we\nright we go from 0 to 20 and if we remove 10 we go from -10 to\nremove 10 we go from -10 to\nremove 10 we go from -10 to 10\nso rotate z\nso rotate z equals rotate z dot value\nequals rotate z dot value\nequals rotate z dot value and these are degrees\nand these are degrees\nand these are degrees looks good\nlooks good\nlooks good and now one thing we can do is when\nand now one thing we can do is when\nand now one thing we can do is when selecting the card scale\nyeah scale the card have the rotate z go\nyeah scale the card have the rotate z go back to zero\nback to zero\nback to zero so i'm gonna add the scale\nso i'm gonna add the scale\nso i'm gonna add the scale transformation\nyou'll notice that here i'm adding the\nyou'll notice that here i'm adding the scale at the end here the order of um of\nscale at the end here the order of um of\nscale at the end here the order of um of the transformation\nthe transformation\nthe transformation is important i will link to a video on\nis important i will link to a video on\nis important i will link to a video on this topic in the video description\nthis topic in the video description\nthis topic in the video description so we're going to create a scale\nso we're going to create a scale\nso we're going to create a scale value\nso you use shared value\nso you use shared value default value is one\ndefault value is one\ndefault value is one when we start the gesture we can put it\nwhen we start the gesture we can put it\nwhen we start the gesture we can put it to\nand rotate z\nand rotate z goes to\ngoes to\ngoes to zero\nzero\nzero and we probably can add maybe some\nand we probably can add maybe some\nand we probably can add maybe some nice easing\nto give it a physical feel\nto give it a physical feel let me import easing from reanimated\nlet me import easing from reanimated\nlet me import easing from reanimated so here i select the card\nso here i select the card\nso here i select the card the rotate z goes to zero\nthe rotate z goes to zero\nthe rotate z goes to zero we scaled nicely\nwe scaled nicely\nwe scaled nicely i need to scale back when we release the\ni need to scale back when we release the\ni need to scale back when we release the gesture\nso on end\nso on end scale.value\nscale.value\nscale.value goes back to one and i i think i should\ngoes back to one and i i think i should\ngoes back to one and i i think i should always do this\nalways do this\nalways do this easing in the animation configuration\nand one thing we could do is also set\nand one thing we could do is also set the rotate x to zero when we select the\nthe rotate x to zero when we select the\nthe rotate x to zero when we select the card\nso that actually looks pretty good\nso that actually looks pretty good and one thing we can do is to animate\nand one thing we can do is to animate\nand one thing we can do is to animate the cards when they appear for the first\nthe cards when they appear for the first\nthe cards when they appear for the first time\ntime\ntime so the default value here for\nso the default value here for\nso the default value here for translate y is going to be let's say\ntranslate y is going to be let's say\ntranslate y is going to be let's say minus the height\nminus the height\nminus the height of the screen so they disappear\nof the screen so they disappear\nof the screen so they disappear and we can as we can add a use effect\nso when we mount the component we want\nso when we mount the component we want the cards to appear\nso let me add the empty dependencies\nso let me add the empty dependencies so\nso\nso we can add\nwe can add\nwe can add so y dot value\nwe can add the timing animation to zero\nwe can add the timing animation to zero again yeah here i have duration and i\nagain yeah here i have duration and i\nagain yeah here i have duration and i want to use some nice easing\nbut of course we want here they all\nbut of course we want here they all appear at the same time we want some\nappear at the same time we want some\nappear at the same time we want some delay which depends on the index of the\ndelay which depends on the index of the\ndelay which depends on the index of the card\ncard\ncard whichever which we have as a property\nwhichever which we have as a property\nwhichever which we have as a property here\nhere\nhere so i'm going to calculate delay simply\nso i'm going to calculate delay simply\nso i'm going to calculate delay simply index time\nindex time\nindex time duration\nso here we can add weave\nso here we can add weave delay\nso what i like in reality 2 is that\nso what i like in reality 2 is that animations are first-class citizens\nanimations are first-class citizens\nanimations are first-class citizens and they can be nicely composed with\nand they can be nicely composed with\nand they can be nicely composed with each other you can add delays timing and\neach other you can add delays timing and\neach other you can add delays timing and you can really actually go pretty crazy\nyou can really actually go pretty crazy\nyou can really actually go pretty crazy with the level of composibility in the\nwith the level of composibility in the\nwith the level of composibility in the the animation you can add pause bouncing\nthe animation you can add pause bouncing\nthe animation you can add pause bouncing uh you name it\nuh you name it\nuh you name it here i can update the array of\nhere i can update the array of\nhere i can update the array of dependencies even though it will never\ndependencies even though it will never\ndependencies even though it will never change\nchange\nchange and one thing\nand one thing\nand one thing we might want to do let's have a look\nwe might want to do let's have a look\nwe might want to do let's have a look so that's\nso that's\nso that's pretty good but also maybe we want to\npretty good but also maybe we want to\npretty good but also maybe we want to set the rotate in the animation\nset the rotate in the animation\nset the rotate in the animation so i'm going to extract it here\num\num [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] so i can\nmaybe i want to add an offset to the\nmaybe i want to add an offset to the delay maybe one second here you can pick\ndelay maybe one second here you can pick\ndelay maybe one second here you can pick any value you would like let's have a\nany value you would like let's have a\nany value you would like let's have a look\nso i think that looks pretty good\nso i think that looks pretty good and i can swipe the cards\nand i can swipe the cards\nand i can swipe the cards and now when all the cards have\nand now when all the cards have\nand now when all the cards have disappeared i would like maybe to\ndisappeared i would like maybe to\ndisappeared i would like maybe to shuffle\nshuffle\nshuffle them back with a nice animation so here\nthem back with a nice animation so here\nthem back with a nice animation so here shuffling back is a state that is across\nshuffling back is a state that is across\nshuffling back is a state that is across all cards so i need to go to the parent\nall cards so i need to go to the parent\nall cards so i need to go to the parent components so here i have all my cards\ncomponents so here i have all my cards\ncomponents so here i have all my cards and i'm going to create a\nand i'm going to create a\nand i'm going to create a shuffle back animation value which is\nshuffle back animation value which is\nshuffle back animation value which is true when we need to shuffle back the\ntrue when we need to shuffle back the\ntrue when we need to shuffle back the cards\ncards\ncards so\nso\nso shuffle back\nshuffle back\nshuffle back default value is false\ndefault value is false\ndefault value is false and i can pass it as a property of each\nand i can pass it as a property of each\nand i can pass it as a property of each card\nso shuffle back is an animated\nso shuffle back is an animated so it's a shared value\nso it's a shared value\nso it's a shared value of boolean\nand\nand when\nwhen\nwhen the gesture ends\nand actually we can look\nand actually we can look when it ends so it means also when it\nwhen it ends so it means also when it\nwhen it ends so it means also when it ends and the animations are over\nends and the animations are over\nends and the animations are over so i can use the callback and with\nso i can use the callback and with\nso i can use the callback and with timing\ntiming\ntiming to see when the animation is over\nto see when the animation is over\nto see when the animation is over so the problem is because spring has\nso the problem is because spring has\nso the problem is because spring has small oscillations\nsmall oscillations\nsmall oscillations even though it looks like the animation\neven though it looks like the animation\neven though it looks like the animation is finished technically it's not done\nis finished technically it's not done\nis finished technically it's not done so with timing will be faster because\nso with timing will be faster because\nso with timing will be faster because it's\nit's\nit's exactly after the default duration it\nexactly after the default duration it\nexactly after the default duration it will be over\nwill be over\nwill be over so we can look if the card is last so\nso we can look if the card is last so\nso we can look if the card is last so here because we have them on top of each\nhere because we have them on top of each\nhere because we have them on top of each other is if index equals zero\nother is if index equals zero\nother is if index equals zero and if the destination\nand if the destination\nand if the destination is left or right so if the destination\nis left or right so if the destination\nis left or right so if the destination was zero we\nwas zero we\nwas zero we we don't need to shuffle back yet so\nwe don't need to shuffle back yet so\nwe don't need to shuffle back yet so if index is zero and destination is\nif index is zero and destination is\nif index is zero and destination is different from zero\nand now for each card component we can\nand now for each card component we can listen to the shuffleback animation\nlisten to the shuffleback animation\nlisten to the shuffleback animation value if it is true we need to animate\nvalue if it is true we need to animate\nvalue if it is true we need to animate and for this we're going to use use\nand for this we're going to use use\nand for this we're going to use use animated reaction\nanimated reaction\nanimated reaction which lets us listen to an anime a\nwhich lets us listen to an anime a\nwhich lets us listen to an anime a change in animation value and react to\nchange in animation value and react to\nchange in animation value and react to it so use animated reaction\nit so use animated reaction\nit so use animated reaction on\non\non shuffleback\nand here i get it as\nand here i get it as parameter of the second but of course we\nparameter of the second but of course we\nparameter of the second but of course we could use shuffleback directly\ncould use shuffleback directly\ncould use shuffleback directly i mean i'm not sure whatever\ni mean i'm not sure whatever\ni mean i'm not sure whatever uh if value\nuh if value\nuh if value no actually let me just i think it's\nno actually let me just i think it's\nno actually let me just i think it's much more explicit i don't know i don't\nmuch more explicit i don't know i don't\nmuch more explicit i don't know i don't know which way is better\nknow which way is better\nknow which way is better so if we need to shuffle back\nso if we need to shuffle back\nso if we need to shuffle back we are going to set\nwe are going to set\nwe are going to set the x value back to zero so x\nthe x value back to zero so x\nthe x value back to zero so x that value equals with\nthat value equals with\nthat value equals with spring\nspring\nspring so to zero\nso to zero\nso to zero and we are we want to add some delay\nand we want also maybe to add rotate z\nand we want also maybe to add rotate z back to the random value so rotate z dot\nback to the random value so rotate z dot\nback to the random value so rotate z dot value is with spring\nso now they will all appear at the same\nso now they will all appear at the same time so again we need some delay value\nhere so here it's a spring\nhere so here it's a spring um\num\num [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] let me put maybe 150 milliseconds so\nlet me put maybe 150 milliseconds so\nlet me put maybe 150 milliseconds so time index\ntime index\ntime index so here we can add with delay\nand when the animation is over\nand when the animation is over so here we can look at any\nso here we can look at any\nso here we can look at any the callback of either animation\nthe callback of either animation\nthe callback of either animation when it's over i simply want to set\nwhen it's over i simply want to set\nwhen it's over i simply want to set shuffle back\nshuffle back\nshuffle back back to false\nback to false\nback to false um sorry i have some yeah so the second\num sorry i have some yeah so the second\num sorry i have some yeah so the second parameter would be the spring config\nparameter would be the spring config\nparameter would be the spring config here i keep the default\nhere i keep the default\nhere i keep the default and then\nand then\nand then we can have the callback for when the\nwe can have the callback for when the\nwe can have the callback for when the animation is over let's have a look\nso the cards appear nicely\nso the cards appear nicely up\nup\nup swiping\nswiping\nswiping and you see\nand you see\nand you see they shuffled back nicely isn't that\nthey shuffled back nicely isn't that\nthey shuffled back nicely
