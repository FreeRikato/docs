To help you understand the terminology we use throughout the documentation, let’s take a look at the example flow below.\n\nNodes\n\nReact Flow has a few default node types out of the box, but customization is where the magic of React Flow truly happens. You can design your nodes to work exactly the way you need them to—whether that’s embedding interactive form elements, displaying dynamic data visualizations, or even incorporating multiple connection handles. React Flow lays the foundation, and your imagination does the rest.\n\nWe have a guide on creating your own Custom Nodes and you can find all the options for customizing your nodes in the Node reference.\n\nHandles\n\nA handle (also known as a “port” in other libraries) is the attachment point where an edge connects to a node. By default, they appear as grey circles on the top, bottom, left, or right sides of a node. But they are just div elements, and can be positioned and styled any way you’d like. When creating a custom node, you can include as many handles as needed. For more information, refer to the Handle page.\n\nEdges\n\nEdges connect nodes. Every edge needs a target and a source node. React Flow comes with four built-in edge types: default (bezier), smoothstep, step, and straight. An edge is a SVG path that can be styled with CSS and is completely customizable. If you are using multiple handles, you can reference them individually to create multiple connections for a node.\n\nLike custom nodes, you can also customize edges. Things that people do with custom edges include:\n\nAdding buttons to remove edges\nCustom routing behavior\nComplex styling or interactions that cannot be solved with just one SVG path\n\nFor more information, refer to the Edges page.\n\nSelection\n\nYou can select an edge or a node by clicking on it. If you want to select multiple nodes/edges via clicking, you can hold the Meta/Control key and click on multiple elements to select them. If you want to change the keyboard key for multiselection to something else, you can use the multiSelectionKeyCode prop.\n\nYou can also select multiple edges/nodes by holding down Shift and dragging the mouse to make a selection box. When you release the mouse, any node or edge that falls within the selection box is selected. If you want to change the keyboard key for this behavior, you can use the selectionKeyCode prop.\n\nSelected nodes and edges are elevated (assigned a higher zIndex than other elements), so that they are shown on top of all the other elements.\n\nFor default edges and nodes, selection is shown by a darker stroke/border than usual. If you are using a custom node/edge, you can use the selected prop to customize selection appearance inside your custom component.\n\nConnection line\n\nReact Flow has built-in functionality that allows you to click and drag from one handle to another to create a new edge. While dragging, the placeholder edge is referred to as a connection line. The connection line comes with the same four built-in types as edges and is customizable. You can find the props for configuring the connection line in the connection props reference.\n\nViewport\n\nAll of React Flow is contained within the viewport. Each node has an x- and y-coordinate, which indicates its position within the viewport. The viewport has x, y, and zoom values. When you drag the pane, you change the x and y coordinates. When you zoom in or out, you alter the zoom level.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nQuick Start\nBuilding a Flow\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

If you just want to have a look around and get an impression of React Flow, check out our interactive no-code Playground .\n\nInstallation\n\nFirst, spin up a new React project however you like — we recommend using Vite \n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm create vite my-react-flow-app --template react\n\nNext cd into your new project folder and add @xyflow/react as a dependency\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add @xyflow/react\n\nLastly, spin up the dev server and you’re good to go!\n\nUsage\n\nWe will render the <ReactFlow /> component from the @xyflow/react package. That and defining a handful of node objects, edge objects and event handlers are all we need to get something going! Get rid of everything inside App.jsx and add the following:\n\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow, applyNodeChanges, applyEdgeChanges, addEdge } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  { id: 'n1', position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: { label: 'Node 1' } },\n  { id: 'n2', position: { x: 0, y: 100 }, data: { label: 'Node 2' } },\n];\nconst initialEdges = [{ id: 'n1-n2', source: 'n1', target: 'n2' }];\n \nexport default function App() {\n  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges] = useState(initialEdges);\n \n  const onNodesChange = useCallback(\n    (changes) => setNodes((nodesSnapshot) => applyNodeChanges(changes, nodesSnapshot)),\n    [],\n  );\n  const onEdgesChange = useCallback(\n    (changes) => setEdges((edgesSnapshot) => applyEdgeChanges(changes, edgesSnapshot)),\n    [],\n  );\n  const onConnect = useCallback(\n    (params) => setEdges((edgesSnapshot) => addEdge(params, edgesSnapshot)),\n    [],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <div style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }}>\n      <ReactFlow\n        nodes={nodes}\n        edges={edges}\n        onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n        onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n        onConnect={onConnect}\n        fitView\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nThere are two things to pay attention to here:\n\n🎨 You must import the css stylesheet for React Flow to work.\n📐 The <ReactFlow /> component must have a parent element with a width and height.\nResult\n\nEt voila.

A flow consists of nodes, edges and the viewport.\n\nTo follow along with this guide you will need to have a React project set up and install the @xyflow/react package:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add @xyflow/react\nCreating the flow\n\nLet’s start by creating an empty flow with viewport <Controls /> and a dotted <Background />.\n\nAdd imports\n\nFirst, we need to import some basic components from the @xyflow/react package and the css stylesheet, which is required for React Flow to work:\n\nimport { ReactFlow, Background, Controls } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\nRender ReactFlow\n\nNow we create a React component, that renders our flow. The width and height on the parent container are required because React Flow uses these dimensions.\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%' }}>\n      <ReactFlow>\n        <Background />\n        <Controls />\n      </ReactFlow>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nEmpty flow\n\nThat’s it! You have created your first empty flow 🎉\n\nAdding nodes\n\nNow that the flow is set up, it’s time to add nodes — each node represents an element in your diagram with a specific position and content.\n\nCreate node objects\n\nOutside of your React component, create an array of node objects. Each node object needs a unique id and a position. Let’s also add a label to them:\n\nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'n1',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    data: { label: 'Node 1' },\n    type: 'input',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'n2',\n    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },\n    data: { label: 'Node 2' },\n  },\n];\nAdd nodes to the flow\n\nNow we can pass our initialNodes array to the <ReactFlow /> component using the nodes prop:\n\n<ReactFlow nodes={initialNodes}>\n  <Background />\n  <Controls />\n</ReactFlow>\nFlow with nodes\n\nThis gives us a flow with two labeled nodes 🎉\n\nWe have several built-in nodes that you can explore in the node reference. However, once you start building your own application, you will want to use custom nodes.\n\nAdding edges\n\nNow that we have two nodes, let’s connect them with an edge.\n\nCreate an edge\n\nTo create an edge, we define an array of edge objects. Each edge object needs to have an id, a source (where the edge begins), and a target (where it ends). In this example, we use the id values of the two nodes we created so far (n1 and n2) to define the edge:\n\nconst initialEdges = [\n  {\n    id: 'n1-n2',\n    source: 'n1',\n    target: 'n2',\n  },\n];\n\nThis edge connects the node with id: 'n1' (the source) to the node with id: 'n2' (the target).\n\nLabel the edge\n\nLet’s give this edge two properties that are built into React Flow, a label and a type: \"step\".\n\nconst initialEdges = [\n  {\n    id: 'n1-n2',\n    source: 'n1',\n    target: 'n2',\n    type: 'step',\n    label: 'connects with',\n  },\n];\nAdd edges to the flow\n\nNow we can pass our initialEdges array to the <ReactFlow /> component using the edges prop:\n\n<ReactFlow nodes={initialNodes} edges={initialEdges}>\n  <Background />\n  <Controls />\n</ReactFlow>\nBasic flow\n\nCongratulations! You have completed a basic flow with nodes and edges! 🎉\n\nFull code example 🏁\n\nYou took your first steps in React Flow! You might have realized that you can’t drag or otherwise interact with nodes. On the next page you’ll learn how to make the flow interactive.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nOverview\nAdding Interactivity\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

You pan by dragging your pointer and zoom by scrolling. You can customize this behavior easily with the interaction and keyboard props on the <ReactFlow /> component.\n\nViewport configurations\n\nHere we will list and explain some configurations that other tools use.\n\nDefault viewport controls\n\nAs mentioned above, the ReactFlow default controls are as follows:\n\npan: pointer drag\nzoom: pinch or scroll\nselect: shift + pointer drag\nDesign tool viewport controls\n\nIf you prefer figma/sketch/design tool controls you can set panOnScroll and selectionOnDrag to true and panOnDrag to false:\n\npan: scroll, middle / right mouse drag, space + pointer drag\nzoom: pinch or cmd + scroll\nselect: pointer drag\n\nIn this example we also set selectionMode=\"partial\" to be able to add nodes to a selection that are only partially selected.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nAdding Interactivity\nBuilt-In Components\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

As you would with an HTML <input /> element you need to pass event handlers to React Flow in order to apply triggered changes to your nodes and edges.\n\nAdd imports\n\nTo manage changes, we’ll be using useState with two helper functions from React Flow: applyNodeChanges and applyEdgeChanges. So let’s import these functions:\n\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow, applyEdgeChanges, applyNodeChanges } from '@xyflow/react';\nDefine nodes and edges\n\nWe need to define initial nodes and edges. These will be the starting point for our flow.\n\nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'n1',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    data: { label: 'Node 1' },\n    type: 'input',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'n2',\n    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },\n    data: { label: 'Node 2' },\n  },\n];\n \nconst initialEdges = [\n  {\n    id: 'n1-n2',\n    source: 'n1',\n    target: 'n2',\n  },\n];\nInitialize state\n\nIn our component, we’ll call the useState hook to manage the state of our nodes and edges:\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges] = useState(initialEdges);\n \n  return (\n    <div style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%' }}>\n      <ReactFlow>\n        <Background />\n        <Controls />\n      </ReactFlow>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nAdd event handlers\n\nWe need to create two event handlers: onNodesChange and onEdgesChange. They will be used to update the state of our nodes and edges when changes occur, such as dragging or deleting an element. Go ahead and add these handlers to your component:\n\nconst onNodesChange = useCallback(\n  (changes) => setNodes((nodesSnapshot) => applyNodeChanges(changes, nodesSnapshot)),\n  [],\n);\nconst onEdgesChange = useCallback(\n  (changes) => setEdges((edgesSnapshot) => applyEdgeChanges(changes, edgesSnapshot)),\n  [],\n);\nPass them to ReactFlow\n\nNow we can pass our nodes, edges, and event handlers to the <ReactFlow /> component:\n\n<ReactFlow\n  nodes={nodes}\n  edges={edges}\n  onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n  onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n  fitView\n>\n  <Background />\n  <Controls />\n</ReactFlow>\nInteractive flow\n\nAnd that’s it! You now have a basic interactive flow 🎉\n\nWhen you drag or select a node, the onNodesChange handler is triggered. The applyNodeChanges function then uses these change events to update the current state of your nodes. Here’s how it all comes together. Try clicking and dragging a node to move it around and watch the UI update in real time.\n\nHandling connections\n\nOne last piece is missing: connecting nodes interactively. For this, we need to implement an onConnect handler.\n\nCreate onConnect handler\n\nThe onConnect handler is called whenever a new connection is made between two nodes. We can use the addEdge utility function to create a new edge and update the edge Array.\n\nconst onConnect = useCallback(\n  (params) => setEdges((edgesSnapshot) => addEdge(params, edgesSnapshot)),\n  [],\n);\nPass it to ReactFlow\n\nNow we can pass the onConnect handler to the <ReactFlow /> component:\n\n<ReactFlow\n  nodes={nodes}\n  edges={edges}\n  onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n  onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n  onConnect={onConnect}\n  fitView\n>\n  <Background />\n  <Controls />\n</ReactFlow>\nConnectable flow\n\nTry to connect the two nodes by dragging from on handle to another one. The onConnect handler will be triggered, and the new edge will be added to the flow. 🥳\n\nFull code example 🏁\n\nWhat is happening here? Whenever React Flow triggers a change (node init, node drag, edge select, etc.), the onNodesChange handler gets called. We export an applyNodeChanges handler so that you don’t need to handle the changes by yourself. The applyNodeChanges handler returns an updated array of nodes that is your new nodes array. You now have an interactive flow with the following capabilities:\n\nselectable nodes and edges\ndraggable nodes\nconnectable nodes by dragging from one node handle to another\nmulti-selection area by pressing shift — the default selectionKeyCode\nmulti-selection by pressing cmd — the default multiSelectionKeyCode\nremoving selected elements by pressing backspace — the default deleteKeyCode\n\nIf you want to jump straight into creating your own application, we recommend checking out the Customization section.

This gives you the flexibility to render anything you want within your nodes. We generally recommend creating your own custom nodes rather than relying on built-in ones. With custom nodes, you can add as many source and target handles as you like—or even embed form inputs, charts, and other interactive elements.\n\nIn this section, we’ll walk through creating a custom node featuring an input field that updates text elsewhere in your application. For further examples, we recommend checking out our Custom Node Example.\n\nImplementing a custom node\n\nTo create a custom node, all you need to do is create a React component. React Flow will automatically wrap it in an interactive container that injects essential props like the node’s id, position, and data, and provides functionality for selection, dragging, and connecting handles. For a full overview on all available node props, see the Node reference.\n\nCreate the component\n\nLet’s dive into an example by creating a custom node called TextUpdaterNode. For this, we’ve added a simple input field with a change handler.\n\nexport function TextUpdaterNode(props) {\n  const onChange = useCallback((evt) => {\n    console.log(evt.target.value);\n  }, []);\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"text-updater-node\">\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"text\">Text:</label>\n        <input id=\"text\" name=\"text\" onChange={onChange} className=\"nodrag\" />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nUsing TypeScript? You can head on over to our TypeScript guide to learn how to set up your custom nodes with the right types. This will make sure you’ll have typed access to your node’s props and data.\n\nInitialize nodeTypes\n\nYou can add a new node type to React Flow by adding it to the nodeTypes prop like below. We define the nodeTypes outside of the component to prevent re-renderings.\n\nconst nodeTypes = {\n  textUpdater: TextUpdaterNode,\n};\nPass nodeTypes to React Flow\n<ReactFlow\n  nodes={nodes}\n  edges={edges}\n  nodeTypes={nodeTypes}\n  onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n  onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n  fitView\n/>\nUpdate node definitions\n\nAfter defining your new node type, you can use it by specifying the type property on your node definition:\n\nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'node-1',\n    type: 'textUpdater',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    data: { value: 123 },\n  },\n];\nFlow with custom node\n\nAfter putting all together and adding some basic styles we get a custom node that prints text to the console:\n\nFull code example 🏁\n\nTo enable your custom node to connect with other nodes, check out the Handles page to learn how to add source and target handles.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nBuilt-In Components\nHandles\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Our built-in nodes include one source and one target handle, but you can customize your nodes with as many different handles as you need.\n\nCreating a node with handles\n\nTo create a custom node with handles, you can use the <Handle /> component provided by React Flow. This component allows you to define source and target handles for your custom nodes. Here’s an example of how to implement a custom node with two handles:\n\nimport { Position, Handle } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport function CustomNode() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"custom-node\">\n      <div>Custom Node Content</div>\n      <Handle type=\"source\" position={Position.Top} />\n      <Handle type=\"target\" position={Position.Bottom} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nUsing multiple handles\n\nIf you want to use multiple source or target handles in your custom node, you need to specify each handle with a unique id. This allows React Flow to differentiate between the handles when connecting edges.\n\n  <Handle type=\"target\" position={Position.Top} />\n  <Handle type=\"source\" position={Position.Right} id=\"a\" />\n  <Handle type=\"source\" position={Position.Bottom} id=\"b\" />\n\nTo connect an edge to a specific handle of a node, use the properties sourceHandle (for the edge’s starting point) and targetHandle (for the edge’s ending point). By defining sourceHandle or targetHandle with the appropriate handle id, you instruct React Flow to attach the edge to that specific handle, ensuring that connections are made where you intend.\n\nconst initialEdges = [\n  { id: 'n1-n2', source: 'n1', sourceHandle: 'a', target: 'n2' },\n  { id: 'n1-n3', source: 'n1', sourceHandle: 'b', target: 'n3' },\n];\n\nIn this case, the source node is n1 for both handles but the handle ids are different. One comes from handle id a and the other one from b. Both edges also have different target nodes:\n\nBy default React Flow positions a handle in the center of the specified side. If you want to display multiple handles on a side, you can adjust the position via inline styles or overwrite the default CSS and position it on your own.\n\nCustom handles\n\nYou can use any custom component as a Handle by wrapping it with the <Handle /> component. Follow these steps to integrate your custom component:\n\nWrap your custom component with <Handle /> component.\nHide the built-in <Handle /> appearance by setting border and background to none.\nSet the widthand height of <Handle /> to match your custom component.\nStyle the child component with pointer-events: none.\nThen, reposition the child custom component using CSS position properties like top, left if necessary to position it perfectly inside the <Handle /> component.\n\nThis example shows a Material UI icon ArrowCircleRightIcon used as a Handle.\n\nimport { Handle, Position } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport ArrowCircleRightIcon from '@mui/icons-material/ArrowCircleRight';\n \nexport function CustomNode() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"react-flow__node-default\">\n      <Handle\n        position={Position.Right}\n        type=\"source\"\n        style={{\n          background: 'none',\n          border: 'none',\n          width: '1em',\n          height: '1em',\n        }}\n      >\n        <ArrowCircleRightIcon\n          style={{\n            pointerEvents: 'none',\n            fontSize: '1em',\n            left: 0,\n            position: 'absolute',\n          }}\n        />\n      </Handle>\n      Custom Node\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nTypeless handles\n\nIf you want to create a handle that does not have a specific type (source or target), you can set connectionMode to Loose in the <ReactFlow /> component. This allows the handle to be used for both incoming and outgoing connections.\n\nDynamic handles\n\nIf you are programmatically changing the position or number of handles in your custom node, you need to update the node internals with the useUpdateNodeInternals hook.\n\nCustom handle styles\n\nSince the handle is a div, you can use CSS to style it or pass a style prop to customize a Handle. You can see this in the Add Node On Edge Drop and Simple Floating Edges examples.\n\nStyling handles when connecting\n\nThe handle receives the additional class names connecting when the connection line is above the handle and valid if the connection is valid. You can find an example which uses these classes here.\n\nHiding handles\n\nIf you need to hide a handle for some reason, you must use visibility: hidden or opacity: 0 instead of display: none. This is important because React Flow needs to calculate the dimensions of the handle to work properly and using display: none will report a width and height of 0!\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nNodes\nEdges\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

In React Flow we call that a custom edge label and unlike the edge path, edge labels can be any React component!\n\nAdding an edge label\n\nTo render a custom edge label we must wrap it in the <EdgeLabelRenderer /> component. This allows us to render the labels outside of the SVG world where the edges life. The edge label renderer is a portal to a single container that all edge labels are rendered into.\n\nLet’s add a button to our custom edge that can be used to delete the edge it’s attached to:\n\nimport {\n  BaseEdge,\n  EdgeLabelRenderer,\n  getStraightPath,\n  useReactFlow,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport default function CustomEdge({ id, sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY }) {\n  const { deleteElements } = useReactFlow();\n  const [edgePath] = getStraightPath({\n    sourceX,\n    sourceY,\n    targetX,\n    targetY,\n  });\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <BaseEdge id={id} path={edgePath} />\n      <EdgeLabelRenderer>\n        <button onClick={() => deleteElements({ edges: [{ id }] })}>delete</button>\n      </EdgeLabelRenderer>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nIf we try to use this edge now, we’ll see that the button is rendered in the centre of the flow (it might be hidden behind “Node A”). Because of the edge label portal, we’ll need to do some extra work to position the button ourselves.\n\nFortunately, the path utils we’ve already seen can help us with this! Along with the SVG path to render, these functions also return the x and y coordinates of the path’s midpoint. We can then use these coordinates to translate our custom edge label’s into the right position!\n\nexport default function CustomEdge({ id, sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY }) {\n  const { deleteElements } = useReactFlow();\n  const [edgePath, labelX, labelY] = getStraightPath({ ... });\n \n  return (\n    ...\n        <button\n          style={{\n            position: 'absolute',\n            transform: `translate(-50%, -50%) translate(${labelX}px, ${labelY}px)`,\n            pointerEvents: 'all',\n          }}\n          className=\"nodrag nopan\"\n          onClick={() => deleteElements({ edges: [{ id }] })}\n        >\n    ...\n  );\n}\n\nTo make sure our edge labels are interactive and not just for presentation, it is important to add pointer-events: all to the label’s style. This will ensure that the label is clickable.\n\nAnd just like with interactive controls in custom nodes, we need to remember to add the nodrag and nopan classes to the label to stop mouse events from controlling the canvas.\n\nHere’s an interactive example with our updated custom edge. Clicking the delete button will remove that edge from the flow. Creating a new edge will use the custom node.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nEdges\nUtility Classes\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

This is particularly useful for elements like buttons or inputs that should not initiate a drag operation when clicked.\n\nNodes have a drag class name in place by default. However, this class name can affect the behaviour of the event listeners inside your custom nodes. To prevent unexpected behaviours, add a nodrag class name to elements with an event listener. This prevents the default drag behavior as well as the default node selection behavior when elements with this class are clicked.\n\nexport default function CustomNode(props: NodeProps) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input className=\"nodrag\" type=\"range\" min={0} max={100} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nnopan\n\nIf an element in the canvas does not stop mouse events from propagating, clicking and dragging that element will pan the viewport. Adding the “nopan” class prevents this behavior and this prop allows you to change the name of that class.\n\nexport default function CustomNode(props: NodeProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"nopan\">\n      <p>fixed content...</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nnowheel\n\nIf your custom element contains scrollable content, you can apply the nowheel class. This disables the canvas’ default pan behavior when you scroll inside your custom node, ensuring that only the content scrolls instead of moving the entire canvas.\n\nexport default function CustomNode(props: NodeProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"nowheel\" style={{ overflow: 'auto' }}>\n      <p>Scrollable content...</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nApplying these utility classes helps you control interaction on a granular level. You can customize these class names inside React Flow’s style props.\n\nWhen creating your own custom nodes, you will also need to remember to style them! Unlike the built-in nodes, custom nodes have no default styles, so feel free to use any styling method you prefer, such as Tailwind CSS.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nEdge Labels\nTheming\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

That means you can render anything you want along an edge! This guide shows you how to implement a custom edge with some additional controls. For a comprehensive reference of props available for custom edges, see the Edge reference.\n\nA basic custom edge\n\nAn edge isn’t much use to us if it doesn’t render a path between two connected nodes. These paths are always SVG-based and are typically rendered using the <BaseEdge /> component. To calculate the actual SVG path to render, React Flow comes with some handy utility functions:\n\ngetBezierPath\ngetSimpleBezierPath\ngetSmoothStepPath\ngetStraightPath\n\nTo kickstart our custom edge, we’ll just render a straight path between the source and target.\n\nCreate the component\n\nWe start by creating a new React component called CustomEdge. Then we render the <BaseEdge /> component with the calculated path. This gives us a straight edge that behaves the same as the built-in default edge version \"straight\".\n\nimport { BaseEdge, getStraightPath } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport function CustomEdge({ id, sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY }) {\n  const [edgePath] = getStraightPath({\n    sourceX,\n    sourceY,\n    targetX,\n    targetY,\n  });\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <BaseEdge id={id} path={edgePath} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nUsing TypeScript? You can head on over to our TypeScript guide to learn how to set up your custom edges with the right types. This will make sure you’ll have typed access to your edge’s props and data.\n\nCreate edgeTypes\n\nOutside of our component, we define an edgeTypes object. We name our new edge type \"custom-edge\" and assign the CustomEdge component we just created to it.\n\nconst edgeTypes = {\n  'custom-edge': CustomEdge,\n};\nPass the edgeTypes prop\n\nTo use it, we also need to update the edgeTypes prop on the <ReactFlow /> component.\n\nexport function Flow() {\n  return <ReactFlow edgeTypes={edgeTypes} />;\n}\nUse the new edge type\n\nAfter defining the edgeTypes object, we can use our new custom edge by setting the type field of an edge to \"custom-edge\".\n\nconst initialEdges = [\n  {\n    id: 'e1',\n    source: 'n1',\n    target: 'n2',\n    type: 'custom-edge',\n  },\n];\nFlow with a custom edge\nCustom SVG edge paths\n\nAs discussed previously, if you want to make a custom edge in React Flow, you have to use either of the four path creation functions discussed above (e.g getBezierPath). However if you want to make some other path shape like a Sinusoidal edge or some other edge type then you will have to make the edge path yourself.\n\nThe edge path we get from functions like getBezierPath is just a path string which we pass into the path prop of the <BaseEdge /> component. It contains the necessary information needed in order to draw that path, like where it should start from, where it should curve, where it should end, etc. A simple straight path string between two points (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) would look like:\n\nM x1 y1 L x2 y2\n\nAn SVG path is a concatenated list of commands like M, L, Q, etc, along with their values. Some of these commands are listed below, along with their supported values.\n\nM x1 y1 is the Move To command which moves the current point to the x1, y1 coordinate.\nL x1 y1 is the Line To command which draws a line from the current point to x1, y1 coordinate.\nQ x1 y1 x2 y2 is the Quadratic Bezier Curve command which draws a bezier curve from the current point to the x2, y2 coordinate. x1, y1 is the control point of the curve which determines the curviness of the curve.\n\nWhenever we want to start a path for our custom edge, we use the M command to move our current point to sourceX, sourceY which we get as props in the custom edge component. Then based on the shape we want, we will use other commands like L(to make lines), Q(to make curves) and then finally end our path at targetX, targetY which we get as props in the custom edge component.\n\nIf you want to learn more about SVG paths, you can check out SVG-Path-Editor . You can paste any SVG path there and analyze individual path commands via an intuitive UI.\n\nHere is an example with two types of custom edge paths, a Step edge and a Sinusoidal edge. You should look at the Step edge first to get your hands dirty with custom SVG paths since it’s simple, and then look at how the Sinusoidal edge is made. After going through this example, you will have the necessary knowledge to make custom SVG paths for your custom edges.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nHandles\nEdge Labels\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

We have renamed the parentNode option to parentId in version 11.11.0. The old property is still supported but will be removed in version 12.\n\nA sub flow is a flow inside a node. It can be a separate flow or a flow that is connected with other nodes outside of its parent. This feature can also be used for grouping nodes. In this part of the docs we are going to build a flow with sub flows and show you the child node specific options.\n\nOrder of Nodes It’s important that your parent nodes appear before their children in the nodes/ defaultNodes array to get processed correctly.\n\nAdding child nodes\n\nIf you want to add a node as a child of another node you need to use the parentId (this was called parentNode in previous versions) option (you can find a list of all options in the node options section). Once we do that, the child node is positioned relative to its parent. A position of { x: 0, y: 0 } is the top left corner of the parent.\n\nIn this example we are setting a fixed width and height of the parent node by passing the style option. Additionally, we set the child extent to 'parent' so that we can’t move the child nodes out of the parent node.\n\nUsing child specific options\n\nWhen you move the parent node you can see that the child nodes move, too. Adding a node to another node with the parentId option, just does one thing: It positions it relatively to its parent. The child node is not really a child markup-wise. You can drag or position the child outside of its parent (when the extent: 'parent' option is not set) but when you move the parent, the child moves with it.\n\nIn the example above we are using the group type for the parent node but you can use any other type as well. The group type is just a convenience node type that has no handles attached.\n\nNow we are going to add some more nodes and edges. As you can see, we can connect nodes within a group and create connections that go from a sub flow to an outer node:\n\nEdge rendering behavior\n\nEdges are rendered below nodes by default, and this behavior applies to both normal nodes and group nodes. However, edges connected to a node with a parent are rendered above nodes.\n\nIf you want to customize the z-index of edges, you can use the zIndex option. For example:\n\nconst defaultEdgeOptions = { zIndex: 1 };\n \n<ReactFlow defaultEdgeOptions={defaultEdgeOptions} />;\n\nThis allows you to render edges above nodes or adjust their stacking order as needed.\n\nUsing a default node type as a parent\n\nLet’s remove the label of node B and add some child nodes. In this example you can see that you can use one of the default node types as parents, too. We also set the child nodes to draggable: false so that they are not draggable anymore.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nOverview\nHooks and Providers\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Contact Us \n\nWhat's new?\n\nReact Flow 12.10.1\nReact Flow 12.10.0\nReact Flow UI Components updated to React 19 and Tailwind CSS 4\n...and more!\nReact Flow Playground\n\nExplore different props, options and layout algorithms in our interactive playground\n\nLaunch\nLearn\nLayouting\nOverview\nCopy page\nOverview\n\nWe regularly get asked how to handle layouting in React Flow. We have not implemented our own layouting solution yet, but will present some viable external libraries on this page. We’ll split things up into resources for layouting nodes and resources for routing edges.\n\nYou can test out some of the layouting options in our playground  or have a look at the examples we’ve put together.\n\nTo start let’s put together a simple example flow that we can use as a base for testing out the different layouting options.\n\nEach of the examples that follow will be built on this empty flow. Where possible we’ve tried to keep the examples confined to just one index.js file so it’s easy for you to compare how they’re set up.\n\nLayouting nodes\n\nFor layouting nodes, there are a few third-party libraries that we think are worth checking out:\n\nLibrary\tDynamic node sizes\tSub-flow layouting\tEdge routing\tBundle size\nDagre \tYes\tYes¹\tNo\t\n\nD3-Hierarchy \tNo\tNo\tNo\t\n\nD3-Force \tYes\tNo\tNo\t\n\nELK \tYes\tYes\tYes\t\n\n¹ Dagre currently has an open issue  that prevents it from laying out sub-flows correctly if any nodes in the sub-flow are connected to nodes outside the sub-flow.\n\nWe’ve loosely ordered these options from simplest to most complex, where dagre is largely a drop-in solution and elkjs is a full-blown highly configurable layouting engine. Below, we’ll take a look at a brief example of how each of these libraries can be used with React Flow. For dagre and elkjs specifically, we have some separate examples you can refer back to here and here.\n\nDagre\nRepo: https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre \nDocs: https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre/wiki#configuring-the-layout \n\nDagre is a simple library for layouting directed graphs. It has minimal configuration options and a focus on speed over choosing the most optimal layout. If you need to organize your flows into a tree, we highly recommend dagre.\n\nWith no effort at all we get a well-organized tree layout! Whenever getLayoutedElements is called, we’ll reset the dagre graph and set the graph’s direction (either left-to-right or top-to-bottom) based on the direction prop. Dagre needs to know the dimensions of each node in order to lay them out, so we iterate over our list of nodes and add them to dagre’s internal graph.\n\nAfter laying out the graph, we’ll return an object with the layouted nodes and edges. We do this by mapping over the original list of nodes and updating each node’s position according to node stored in the dagre graph.\n\nDocumentation for dagre’s configuration options can be found here , including properties to set for spacing and alignment.\n\nD3-Hierarchy\nRepo: https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy \nDocs: https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy \n\nWhen you know your graph is a tree with a single root node, d3-hierarchy can provide a handful of interesting layouting options. While the library can layout a simple tree just fine, it also has layouting algorithms for tree maps, partition layouts, and enclosure diagrams.\n\nD3-hierarchy expects your graphs to have a single root node, so it won’t work in all cases. It’s also important to note that d3-hierarchy assigns the same width and height to all nodes when calculating the layout, so it’s not the best choice if you’re displaying lots of different node types.\n\nD3-Force\nRepo: https://github.com/d3/d3-force \nDocs: https://d3js.org/d3-force \n\nFor something more interesting than a tree, a force-directed layout might be the way to go. D3-Force is a physics-based layouting library that can be used to position nodes by applying different forces to them.\n\nAs a consequence, it’s a little more complicated to configure and use compared to dagre and d3-hierarchy. Importantly, d3-force’s layouting algorithm is iterative, so we need a way to keep computing the layout across multiple renders.\n\nFirst, let’s see what it does:\n\nWe’ve changed our getLayoutedElements to a hook called useLayoutedElements instead. Additionally, instead of passing in the nodes and edges explicitly, we’ll use get getNodes and getEdges functions from the useReactFlow hook. This is important when combined with the store selector in initialized because it will prevent us from reconfiguring the simulation any time the nodes update.\n\nThe simulation is configured with a number of different forces applied so you can see how they interact: play around in your own code to see how you want to configure those forces. You can find the documentation and some different examples of d3-force here .\n\nRectangular collisions D3-Force has a built-in collision force, but it assumes nodes are circles. We’ve thrown together a custom force in collision.js that uses a similar algorithm but accounts for our rectangular nodes instead. Feel free to steal it or let us know if you have any suggestions for improvements!\n\nThe tick function progresses the simulation by one step and then updates React Flow with the new node positions. We’ve also included a demonstration on how to handle node dragging while the simulation is running: if your flow isn’t interactive you can ignore that part!\n\nFor larger graphs, computing the force layout every render forever is going to incur a big performance hit. In this example we have a simple toggle to turn the layouting on and off, but you might want to come up with some other approach to only compute the layout when necessary.\n\nElkjs\nRepo: https://github.com/kieler/elkjs \nDocs: https://eclipse.dev/elk/reference.html  (good luck!)\n\nElkjs is certainly the most configurable option available, but it’s also the most complicated. Elkjs is a Java library that’s been ported to JavaScript, and it provides a huge number of options for configuring the layout of your graph.\n\nAt it’s most basic we can compute layouts similar to dagre, but because the layouting algorithm runs asynchronously we need to create a useLayoutedElements hook similar to the one we created for d3-force.\n\nThe ELK reference is your new best friend We don’t often recommend elkjs because it’s complexity makes it difficult for us to support folks when they need it. If you do decide to use it, you’ll want to keep the original Java API reference  handy.\n\nWe’ve also included a few examples of some of the other layouting algorithms available, including a non-interactive force layout.\n\nHonourable Mentions\n\nOf course, we can’t go through every layouting library out there: we’d never work on anything else! Here are some other libraries we’ve come across that might be worth taking a look at:\n\nIf you want to use dagre or d3-hierarchy but need to support nodes with different dimensions, both d3-flextree  and entitree-flex  look promising.\n\nYou can find an example of how to use entitree-flex with React Flow here.\n\nCola.js  looks like a promising option for so-called “constraint-based” layouts. We haven’t had time to properly investigate it yet, but it looks like you can achieve results similar to d3-force but with a lot more control.\n\nRouting Edges\n\nIf you don’t have any requirements for edge routing, you can use one of the layouting libraries above to position nodes and let the edges fall wherever they may. Otherwise, you’ll want to look into some libraries and techniques for edge routing.\n\nYour options here are more limited than for node layouting, but here are some resources we thought looked promising:\n\nreact-flow-smart-edge \nRouting Orthogonal Diagram Connectors in JavaScript \n\nIf you do explore some custom edge routing options, consider contributing back to the community by writing a blog post or creating a library!\n\nOur editable edge Pro Example could also be used as a starting point for implementing a custom edge that can be routed along a specific path.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nTheming\nSub Flows\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Many of our users fully transform the look and feel of React Flow to match their own brand or design system. This guide will introduce you to the different ways you can customize React Flow’s appearance.\n\nDefault styles\n\nReact Flow’s default styles are enough to get going with the built-in nodes. They provide some sensible defaults for styles like padding, border radius, and animated edges. You can see what they look like below:\n\nApp.tsx\nindex.css\nindex.tsx\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  Background,\n  Controls,\n  MiniMap,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n  addEdge,\n  Position,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \n \nconst nodeDefaults = {\n  sourcePosition: Position.Right,\n  targetPosition: Position.Left,\n};\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 150 },\n    data: { label: 'default style 1' },\n    ...nodeDefaults,\n  },\n  {\n    id: '2',\n    position: { x: 250, y: 0 },\n    data: { label: 'default style 2' },\n    ...nodeDefaults,\n  },\n  {\n    id: '3',\n    position: { x: 250, y: 150 },\n    data: { label: 'default style 3' },\n    ...nodeDefaults,\n  },\n  {\n    id: '4',\n    position: { x: 250, y: 300 },\n    data: { label: 'default style 4' },\n    ...nodeDefaults,\n  },\n];\n \nconst initialEdges = [\n  {\n    id: 'e1-2',\n    source: '1',\n    target: '2',\n    animated: true,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'e1-3',\n    source: '1',\n    target: '3',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'e1-4',\n    source: '1',\n    target: '4',\n  },\n];\n \nconst Flow = () => {\n  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);\n \n  const onConnect = useCallback(\n    (params) => setEdges((els) => addEdge(params, els)),\n    [],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={nodes}\n      edges={edges}\n      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n      onConnect={onConnect}\n      fitView\n    >\n      <Background />\n      <Controls />\n      <MiniMap />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n};\n \nexport default Flow;\n\nYou’ll typically load these default styles by importing them in you App.jsx file or other entry point:\n\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n\nWithout dipping into custom nodes and edges, there are three ways you can style React Flow’s basic look:\n\nPassing inline styles through style props\nOverriding the built-in classes with custom CSS\nOverriding the CSS variables React Flow uses\nBuilt in dark and light mode\n\nYou can choose one of the built-in color modes by using the colorMode prop (‘dark’, ‘light’ or ‘system’) as seen in the dark mode example.\n\nimport ReactFlow from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport default function Flow() {\n  return <ReactFlow colorMode=\"dark\" nodes={[...]} edges={[...]} />\n}\n\nWhen you use the colorMode prop, React Flow adds a class to the root element (.react-flow) that you can use to style your flow based on the color mode:\n\n.dark .react-flow__node {\n  background: #777;\n  color: white;\n}\n \n.light .react-flow__node {\n  background: white;\n  color: #111;\n}\nCustomizing with style props\n\nThe easiest way to start customizing the look and feel of your flows is to use the style prop found on many of React Flow’s components to inline your own CSS.\n\nimport ReactFlow from '@xyflow/react'\n \nconst styles = {\n  background: 'red',\n  width: '100%',\n  height: 300,\n};\n \nexport default function Flow() {\n  return <ReactFlow style={styles} nodes={[...]} edges={[...]} />\n}\nCSS variables\n\nIf you don’t want to replace the default styles entirely but just want to tweak the overall look and feel, you can override some of the CSS variables we use throughout the library. For an example of how to use these CSS variables, check out our Feature Overview example.\n\nThese variables are mostly self-explanatory. Below is a table of all the variables you might want to tweak and their default values for reference:\n\nVariable name\tDefault\n--xy-edge-stroke-default\t#b1b1b7\n--xy-edge-stroke-width-default\t1\n--xy-edge-stroke-selected-default\t#555\n--xy-connectionline-stroke-default\t#b1b1b7\n--xy-connectionline-stroke-width-default\t1\n--xy-attribution-background-color-default\trgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\n--xy-minimap-background-color-default\t#fff\n--xy-background-pattern-dots-color-default\t#91919a\n--xy-background-pattern-line-color-default\t#eee\n--xy-background-pattern-cross-color-default\t#e2e2e2\n--xy-node-color-default\tinherit\n--xy-node-border-default\t1px solid #1a192b\n--xy-node-background-color-default\t#fff\n--xy-node-group-background-color-default\trgba(240, 240, 240, 0.25)\n--xy-node-boxshadow-hover-default\t0 1px 4px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)\n--xy-node-boxshadow-selected-default\t0 0 0 0.5px #1a192b\n--xy-handle-background-color-default\t#1a192b\n--xy-handle-border-color-default\t#fff\n--xy-selection-background-color-default\trgba(0, 89, 220, 0.08)\n--xy-selection-border-default\t1px dotted rgba(0, 89, 220, 0.8)\n--xy-controls-button-background-color-default\t#fefefe\n--xy-controls-button-background-color-hover-default\t#f4f4f4\n--xy-controls-button-color-default\tinherit\n--xy-controls-button-color-hover-default\tinherit\n--xy-controls-button-border-color-default\t#eee\n--xy-controls-box-shadow-default\t0 0 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)\n--xy-resize-background-color-default\t#3367d9\n\nThese variables are used to define the defaults for the various elements of React Flow. This means they can still be overridden by inline styles or custom classes on a per-element basis. If you want to override these variables, you can do so by adding:\n\n.react-flow {\n  --xy-node-background-color-default: #ff5050;\n}\n\nBe aware that these variables are defined under .react-flow and under :root.\n\nOverriding built-in classes\n\nSome consider heavy use of inline styles to be an anti-pattern. In that case, you can override the built-in classes that React Flow uses with your own CSS. There are many classes attached to all sorts of elements in React Flow, but the ones you’ll likely want to override are listed below:\n\nClass name\tDescription\n.react-flow\tThe outermost container\n.react-flow__renderer\tThe inner container\n.react-flow__zoompane\tZoom & pan pane\n.react-flow__selectionpane\tSelection pane\n.react-flow__selection\tUser selection\n.react-flow__edges\tThe element containing all edges in the flow\n.react-flow__edge\tApplied to each Edge in the flow\n.react-flow__edge.selected\tAdded to an Edge when selected\n.react-flow__edge.animated\tAdded to an Edge when its animated prop is true\n.react-flow__edge.updating\tAdded to an Edge while it gets updated via onReconnect\n.react-flow__edge-path\tThe SVG <path /> element of an Edge\n.react-flow__edge-text\tThe SVG <text /> element of an Edge label\n.react-flow__edge-textbg\tThe SVG <text /> element behind an Edge label\n.react-flow__connection\tApplied to the current connection line\n.react-flow__connection-path\tThe SVG <path /> of a connection line\n.react-flow__nodes\tThe element containing all nodes in the flow\n.react-flow__node\tApplied to each Node in the flow\n.react-flow__node.selected\tAdded to a Node when selected.\n.react-flow__node-default\tAdded when Node type is \"default\"\n.react-flow__node-input\tAdded when Node type is \"input\"\n.react-flow__node-output\tAdded when Node type is \"output\"\n.react-flow__nodesselection\tNodes selection\n.react-flow__nodesselection-rect\tNodes selection rect\n.react-flow__handle\tApplied to each <Handle /> component\n.react-flow__handle-top\tApplied when a handle’s Position is set to \"top\"\n.react-flow__handle-right\tApplied when a handle’s Position is set to \"right\"\n.react-flow__handle-bottom\tApplied when a handle’s Position is set to \"bottom\"\n.react-flow__handle-left\tApplied when a handle’s Position is set to \"left\"\n.connectingfrom\tAdded to a Handle when a connection line is above a handle.\n.connectingto\tAdded to a Handle when a connection line is above a handle.\n.valid\tAdded to a Handle when a connection line is above and the connection is valid\n.react-flow__background\tApplied to the <Background /> component\n.react-flow__minimap\tApplied to the <MiniMap /> component\n.react-flow__controls\tApplied to the <Controls /> component\n\nBe careful if you go poking around the source code looking for other classes to override. Some classes are used internally and are required in order for the library to be functional. If you replace them you may end up with unexpected bugs or errors!\n\nThird-party solutions\n\nYou can choose to opt-out of React Flow’s default styling altogether and use a third-party styling solution instead. If you want to do this, you must make sure you still import the base styles.\n\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/base.css';\n\nThese base styles are required for React Flow to function correctly. If you don’t import them or you override them with your own styles, some things might not work as expected!\n\nApp.jsx\nindex.css\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  Background,\n  Controls,\n  MiniMap,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n  addEdge,\n  Position,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/base.css';\n \nconst nodeDefaults = {\n  sourcePosition: Position.Right,\n  targetPosition: Position.Left,\n};\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 150 },\n    data: { label: 'base style 1' },\n    ...nodeDefaults,\n  },\n  {\n    id: '2',\n    position: { x: 250, y: 0 },\n    data: { label: 'base style 2' },\n    ...nodeDefaults,\n  },\n  {\n    id: '3',\n    position: { x: 250, y: 150 },\n    data: { label: 'base style 3' },\n    ...nodeDefaults,\n  },\n  {\n    id: '4',\n    position: { x: 250, y: 300 },\n    data: { label: 'base style 4' },\n    ...nodeDefaults,\n  },\n];\n \nconst initialEdges = [\n  {\n    id: 'e1-2',\n    source: '1',\n    target: '2',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'e1-3',\n    source: '1',\n    target: '3',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'e1-4',\n    source: '1',\n    target: '4',\n  },\n];\n \nconst Flow = () => {\n  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);\n \n  const onConnect = useCallback(\n    (params) => setEdges((els) => addEdge(params, els)),\n    [],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={nodes}\n      edges={edges}\n      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n      onConnect={onConnect}\n      fitView\n    >\n      <Background />\n      <Controls />\n      <MiniMap />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n};\n \nexport default Flow;\nTailwindCSS\n\nCustom nodes and edges are just React components, and you can use any styling solution you’d like to style them. For example, you might want to use Tailwind  to style your nodes:\n\nfunction CustomNode({ data }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"px-4 py-2 shadow-md rounded-md bg-white border-2 border-stone-400\">\n      <div className=\"flex\">\n        <div className=\"rounded-full w-12 h-12 flex justify-center items-center bg-gray-100\">\n          {data.emoji}\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"ml-2\">\n          <div className=\"text-lg font-bold\">{data.name}</div>\n          <div className=\"text-gray-500\">{data.job}</div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n \n      <Handle\n        type=\"target\"\n        position={Position.Top}\n        className=\"w-16 !bg-teal-500\"\n      />\n      <Handle\n        type=\"source\"\n        position={Position.Bottom}\n        className=\"w-16 !bg-teal-500\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nIf you want to overwrite default styles, make sure to import Tailwinds entry point after React Flows base styles.\n\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\nimport 'tailwind.css';\n\nFor a complete example of using Tailwind with React Flow, check out the example!\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nUtility Classes\nOverview\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

If you want to test a React Flow application, we recommend to use Cypress  or Playwright . React Flow needs to measure nodes in order to render edges and for that relies on rendering DOM elements.\n\nUsing Cypress or Playwright\n\nIf you are using Cypress or Playwright no additional setup is needed. You can refer to the getting started guide for Cypress here  and for Playwright here .\n\nUsing Jest\n\nIf you are using Jest , you need to mock some features in order to be able to run your tests. You can do that by adding this file to your project. Calling mockReactFlow() in a setupTests file (or inside a beforeEach) will trigger the necessary overrides.\n\n// To make sure that the tests are working, it's important that you are using\n// this implementation of ResizeObserver and DOMMatrixReadOnly\nclass ResizeObserver {\n  callback: globalThis.ResizeObserverCallback;\n \n  constructor(callback: globalThis.ResizeObserverCallback) {\n    this.callback = callback;\n  }\n \n  observe(target: Element) {\n    this.callback([{ target } as globalThis.ResizeObserverEntry], this);\n  }\n \n  unobserve() {}\n \n  disconnect() {}\n}\n \nclass DOMMatrixReadOnly {\n  m22: number;\n  constructor(transform: string) {\n    const scale = transform?.match(/scale\\(([1-9.])\\)/)?.[1];\n    this.m22 = scale !== undefined ? +scale : 1;\n  }\n}\n \n// Only run the shim once when requested\nlet init = false;\n \nexport const mockReactFlow = () => {\n  if (init) return;\n  init = true;\n \n  global.ResizeObserver = ResizeObserver;\n \n  // @ts-ignore\n  global.DOMMatrixReadOnly = DOMMatrixReadOnly;\n \n  Object.defineProperties(global.HTMLElement.prototype, {\n    offsetHeight: {\n      get() {\n        return parseFloat(this.style.height) || 1;\n      },\n    },\n    offsetWidth: {\n      get() {\n        return parseFloat(this.style.width) || 1;\n      },\n    },\n  });\n \n  (global.SVGElement as any).prototype.getBBox = () => ({\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0,\n    width: 0,\n    height: 0,\n  });\n};\n\nIf you want to test mouse events with jest (for example inside your custom nodes), you need to disable d3-drag as it does not work outside of the browser:\n\n<ReactFlow nodesDraggable={false} panOnDrag={false} {...rest} />\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nAccessibility\nTypeScript\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Contact Us \n\nWhat's new?\n\nReact Flow 12.10.1\nReact Flow 12.10.0\nReact Flow UI Components updated to React 19 and Tailwind CSS 4\n...and more!\nReact Flow Playground\n\nExplore different props, options and layout algorithms in our interactive playground\n\nLaunch\nLearn\nAdvanced Use\nAccessibility\nCopy page\nAccessibility\n\nIf you have suggestions for how we can improve the accessibility of React Flow, please feel free to contact us .\n\nReact Flow provides keyboard and screen-reader support to help meet accessibility standards. By default, all nodes and edges are keyboard-focusable and operable. You can enable or disable these features with props including: nodesFocusable, edgesFocusable, and disableKeyboardA11y which are passed through <ReactFlow /> like this:\n\n<ReactFlow\n  nodesFocusable={true}\n  edgesFocusable={true}\n  disableKeyboardA11y={false}\n  nodes={nodes}\n  edges={edges}\n>\n  {/* ...other components like Controls, MiniMap... */}\n</ReactFlow>\nBuilt-in features\nTab navigation: Pressing Tab moves focus through all focusable nodes and edges. These elements receive tabIndex={0} and, by default, role=\"group\" to handle interactivity.\nSelect/Deselect: Press Enter or Space to select the focused node/edge, and Escape to clear the selection.\nMove nodes with arrow keys: If nodesDraggable and nodesFocusable are both true (default), you can move the selected node with the arrow keys. You can hold Shift to increase movement speed. If you set disableKeyboardA11y={true}, arrow-key movement is disabled (but tab-focus and selection still work).\nAutomatic panning: When a node receives focus, React Flow automatically pans the canvas to bring that node into view. This ensures focused nodes are visible to the user. This behavior can be toggled via the autoPanOnNodeFocus prop.\nARIA descriptions: React Flow automatically adds ARIA descriptions for keyboard guidance. These can be configured by using ariaLabelConfig.\n\nTo enable full keyboard accessibility, ensure both nodesFocusable and edgesFocusable are set to true. If either is false, corresponding elements will not be keyboard-focusable.\n\nARIA roles for nodes and edges\n\nBy default, React Flow uses semantic ARIA roles for interactive elements. You can override a node’s role using the ariaRole prop. For example:\n\nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    data: { label: 'Hello' },\n    ariaRole: 'button',\n  },\n];\n<ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={[]} />;\n\nBy, default, if you don’t set a role, role=\"group\" is applied. Customizing ariaRole lets you match any relevant ARIA role (e.g. \"listitem\", \"region\", etc.), improving semantic information for assistive technology.\n\nNote: The ariaRole is applied to the node wrapper. If a custom node includes interactive elements, avoid setting ariaRole: 'button' on the node itself. Instead, apply the appropriate ARIA role directly to the interactive element.\n\nDOM attributes\n\nTo pass custom ARIA attributes or other DOM-level attributes (e.g., aria-roledescription, data-\\*,tabIndex, etc.), you can use the domAttributes prop. This is available for both nodes and edges:\n\n// Example for a node\n{\n  id: '2',\n  data: { label: 'Accessible Node' },\n  domAttributes: {\n    'aria-roledescription': 'collapsible node',\n    tabIndex: 0,\n    'data-test-id': 'node-2',\n  },\n}\n\nThis gives you full control over accessibility-related attributes while maintaining React Flow’s built-in roles and behaviors.\n\nLocalizing accessibility messages\n\nReact Flow’s built-in accessibility text (such as keyboard instructions and live updates) can be customized or localized via the ariaLabelConfig prop on<ReactFlow>. This prop takes an object mapping message keys to strings or functions. Keys include:\n\nKey\tDefault Value\nnode.a11yDescription.default\tPress enter or space to select a node. Press delete to remove it and escape to cancel.\nnode.a11yDescription.keyboardDisabled\tPress enter or space to select a node. You can then use the arrow keys to move the node around. Press delete to remove it and escape to cancel.\nnode.a11yDescription.ariaLiveMessage\tMoved selected node {direction}. New position, x: {x}, y: {y}\nedge.a11yDescription.default\tPress enter or space to select an edge. You can then press delete to remove it or escape to cancel.\ncontrols.ariaLabel\tControl Panel\ncontrols.zoomIn.ariaLabel\tZoom In\ncontrols.zoomOut.ariaLabel\tZoom Out\ncontrols.fitView.ariaLabel\tFit View\ncontrols.interactive.ariaLabel\tToggle Interactivity\nminimap.ariaLabel\tMini Map\nhandle.ariaLabel\tHandle\n\nFor example, to provide custom or localized text:\n\nconst ariaLabels = {\n  'node.a11yDescription.default': 'Press [Enter] to select this node',\n  'node.a11yDescription.keyboardDisabled': 'Keyboard navigation is disabled',\n};\n<ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={edges} ariaLabelConfig={ariaLabels}>\n  <MiniMap />\n  <Controls />\n</ReactFlow>;\n\nThis tells React Flow to use your text instead of the defaults. By supplying localized strings via ariaLabelConfig, you ensure screen readers announce messages in the user’s language.\n\nWCAG 2.1 AA\n\nReact Flow provides features that can help you meet key WCAG 2.1 AA criteria when properly implemented:\n\nKeyboard: React Flow supports keyboard operability with Tab navigation to nodes and edges, interaction via Enter/Space, and arrow key movement for nodes. These features help satisfy requirements for keyboard accessibility.\nScreen Reader: With semantic ARIA roles and labels (e.g. role=\"group\", aria-label, and aria-roledescription), React Flow enables you to create meaningfully announced graphical nodes/edges. Edge components include a customizable aria-label and nodes can be given appropriate aria-label text.\nARIA Live Regions: Dynamic updates are announced through an aria-live region. The A11yDescriptions component includes an element with aria-live=\"assertive\" that notifies users of node movements, helping you meet requirements for status messages.\nInstructions and Focus Management: React Flow provides contextual help with clear instructions like “Press enter or space to select a node…”. The automatic focus management ensures nodes scroll into view when focused, helping satisfy requirements for input assistance.\n\nThis guide is helpful for learning about ARIA best practices .\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nHooks and Providers\nTesting\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

These tools help you to manage state, access internal methods, and create custom components more effectively.\n\nReactFlowProvider\n\nThe ReactFlowProvider is a context provider that allows you to access the internal state of the flow, such as nodes, edges, and viewport, from anywhere in your component tree even outside the ReactFlow component. It is typically used at the top level of your application.\n\nThere are several cases where you might need to use the ReactFlowProvider component:\n\nMany of the hooks we provide rely on this component to work.\nYou want to access the internal state of the flow outside of the ReactFlow component.\nYou are working with multiple flows on a page.\nYou are using a client-side router.\nApp.jsx\nSidebar.jsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  Background,\n  ReactFlow,\n  ReactFlowProvider,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n  addEdge,\n  Controls,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport Sidebar from './Sidebar';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'provider-1',\n    type: 'input',\n    data: { label: 'Node 1' },\n    position: { x: 250, y: 5 },\n  },\n  { id: 'provider-2', data: { label: 'Node 2' }, position: { x: 100, y: 100 } },\n  { id: 'provider-3', data: { label: 'Node 3' }, position: { x: 400, y: 100 } },\n  { id: 'provider-4', data: { label: 'Node 4' }, position: { x: 400, y: 200 } },\n];\n \nconst initialEdges = [\n  {\n    id: 'provider-e1-2',\n    source: 'provider-1',\n    target: 'provider-2',\n    animated: true,\n  },\n  { id: 'provider-e1-3', source: 'provider-1', target: 'provider-3' },\n];\n \nconst ProviderFlow = () => {\n  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);\n  const onConnect = useCallback(\n    (params) => setEdges((els) => addEdge(params, els)),\n    [],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"providerflow\">\n      <ReactFlowProvider>\n        <div className=\"reactflow-wrapper\">\n          <ReactFlow\n            nodes={nodes}\n            edges={edges}\n            onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n            onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n            onConnect={onConnect}\n            fitView\n          >\n            <Controls />\n            <Background />\n          </ReactFlow>\n        </div>\n        <Sidebar nodes={nodes} setNodes={setNodes} />\n      </ReactFlowProvider>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n \nexport default ProviderFlow;\nuseReactFlow\n\nThe useReactFlow hook provides access to the ReactFlowInstance and its methods.

Controlled means, that you are in control of the state of the nodes and edges. In an uncontrolled flow the state of the nodes and edges is handled by React Flow internally. In this part we will show you how to work with an uncontrolled flow.\n\nAn implementation of an uncontrolled flow is simpler, because you don’t need to pass any handlers:\n\nAs you can see, we are passing defaultEdgeOptions to define that edges are animated. This is helpful, because you can’t use the onConnect handler anymore to pass custom options to a newly created edge. Try to connect “Node B” with “Node C” and you see that the new edge is animated.\n\nUpdating nodes and edges\n\nSince you don’t have nodes and edges in your local state, you can’t update them directly. To do so, you need to use the React Flow instance that comes with functions for updating the internal state. You can receive the instance via the onInit callback or better by using the useReactFlow hook. Let’s create a button that adds a new node at a random position. For this, we are wrapping our flow with the ReactFlowProvider and use the addNodes function.\n\nThe Flow component in this example is wrapped with the ReactFlowProvider to use the useReactFlow hook.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nTypeScript\nPerformance\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

We export all the types you need for correctly typing data structures and functions you pass to the React Flow component. We also provide a way to extend the types of nodes and edges.\n\nBasic usage\n\nLet’s start with the most basic types you need for a simple starting point. Typescript might already infer some of these types, but we will define them explicitly nonetheless.\n\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  addEdge,\n  applyNodeChanges,\n  applyEdgeChanges,\n  type Node,\n  type Edge,\n  type FitViewOptions,\n  type OnConnect,\n  type OnNodesChange,\n  type OnEdgesChange,\n  type OnNodeDrag,\n  type DefaultEdgeOptions,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nconst initialNodes: Node[] = [\n  { id: '1', data: { label: 'Node 1' }, position: { x: 5, y: 5 } },\n  { id: '2', data: { label: 'Node 2' }, position: { x: 5, y: 100 } },\n];\n \nconst initialEdges: Edge[] = [{ id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }];\n \nconst fitViewOptions: FitViewOptions = {\n  padding: 0.2,\n};\n \nconst defaultEdgeOptions: DefaultEdgeOptions = {\n  animated: true,\n};\n \nconst onNodeDrag: OnNodeDrag = (_, node) => {\n  console.log('drag event', node.data);\n};\n \nfunction Flow() {\n  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState<Node[]>(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges] = useState<Edge[]>(initialEdges);\n \n  const onNodesChange: OnNodesChange = useCallback(\n    (changes) => setNodes((nds) => applyNodeChanges(changes, nds)),\n    [setNodes],\n  );\n  const onEdgesChange: OnEdgesChange = useCallback(\n    (changes) => setEdges((eds) => applyEdgeChanges(changes, eds)),\n    [setEdges],\n  );\n  const onConnect: OnConnect = useCallback(\n    (connection) => setEdges((eds) => addEdge(connection, eds)),\n    [setEdges],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={nodes}\n      edges={edges}\n      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n      onConnect={onConnect}\n      onNodeDrag={onNodeDrag}\n      fitView\n      fitViewOptions={fitViewOptions}\n      defaultEdgeOptions={defaultEdgeOptions}\n    />\n  );\n}\nCustom nodes\n\nWhen working with custom nodes you have the possibility to pass a custom Node type (or your Node union) to the NodeProps type. There are basically two ways to work with custom nodes:\n\nIf you have multiple custom nodes, you want to pass a specific Node type as a generic to the NodeProps type:\nNumberNode.tsx\nimport type { Node, NodeProps } from '@xyflow/react';\n \ntype NumberNode = Node<{ number: number }, 'number'>;\n \nexport default function NumberNode({ data }: NodeProps<NumberNode>) {\n  return <div>A special number: {data.number}</div>;\n}\n\n⚠️ If you specify the node data separately, you need to use type (an interface would not work here):\n\ntype NumberNodeData = { number: number };\ntype NumberNode = Node<NumberNodeData, 'number'>;\nIf you have one custom node that renders different content based on the node type, you want to pass your Node union type as a generic to NodeProps:\nCustomNode.tsx\nimport type { Node, NodeProps } from '@xyflow/react';\n \ntype NumberNode = Node<{ number: number }, 'number'>;\ntype TextNode = Node<{ text: string }, 'text'>;\n \ntype AppNode = NumberNode | TextNode;\n \nexport default function CustomNode({ data }: NodeProps<AppNode>) {\n  if (data.type === 'number') {\n    return <div>A special number: {data.number}</div>;\n  }\n \n  return <div>A special text: {data.text}</div>;\n}\nCustom edges\n\nFor custom edges you have the same possibility as for custom nodes.\n\nCustomEdge.tsx\nimport { getStraightPath, BaseEdge, type EdgeProps, type Edge } from '@xyflow/react';\n \ntype CustomEdge = Edge<{ value: number }, 'custom'>;\n \nexport default function CustomEdge({\n  id,\n  sourceX,\n  sourceY,\n  targetX,\n  targetY,\n}: EdgeProps<CustomEdge>) {\n  const [edgePath] = getStraightPath({ sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY });\n \n  return <BaseEdge id={id} path={edgePath} />;\n}\nAdvanced usage\n\nWhen creating complex applications with React Flow, you will have a number of custom nodes & edges, each with different kinds of data attached to them. When we operate on these nodes & edges through built in functions and hooks, we have to make sure that we narrow down  the types of nodes & edges to prevent runtime errors.\n\nNode and Edge type unions\n\nYou will see many functions, callbacks and hooks (even the ReactFlow component itself) that expect a NodeType or EdgeType generic. These generics are unions  of all the different types of nodes & edges you have in your application. As long as you have typed the data objects correctly (see previous section), you can use their exported type.\n\nIf you use any of the built-in nodes (‘input’, ‘output’, ‘default’) or edges (‘straight’, ‘step’, ‘smoothstep’, ‘bezier’), you can add the BuiltInNode and BuiltInEdge types exported from @xyflow/react to your union type.\n\nimport type { BuiltInNode, BuiltInEdge } from '@xyflow/react';\n \n// Custom nodes\nimport NumberNode from './NumberNode';\nimport TextNode from './TextNode';\n \n// Custom edge\nimport EditableEdge from './EditableEdge';\n \nexport type CustomNodeType = BuiltInNode | NumberNode | TextNode;\nexport type CustomEdgeType = BuiltInEdge | EditableEdge;\nFunctions passed to <ReactFlow />\n\nTo receive correct types for callback functions, you can pass your union types to the ReactFlow component. By doing that you will have to type your callback functions explicitly.\n\nimport { type OnNodeDrag } from '@xyflow/react';\n \n// ...\n \n// Pass your union type here ...\nconst onNodeDrag: OnNodeDrag<CustomNodeType> = useCallback((_, node) => {\n  if (node.type === 'number') {\n    // From here on, Typescript knows that node.data\n    // is of type { num: number }\n    console.log('drag event', node.data.number);\n  }\n}, []);\n \nconst onNodesChange: OnNodesChange<CustomNodeType> = useCallback(\n  (changes) => setNodes((nds) => applyNodeChanges(changes, nds)),\n  [setNodes],\n);\nHooks\n\nThe type unions can also be used to type the return values of many hooks.\n\nFlowComponent.tsx\nimport { useReactFlow, useNodeConnections, useNodesData, useStore } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport default function FlowComponent() {\n  // returned nodes and edges are correctly typed now\n  const { getNodes, getEdges } = useReactFlow<CustomNodeType, CustomEdgeType>();\n \n  // You can type useStore by typing the selector function\n  const nodes = useStore((s: ReactFlowState<CustomNodeType>) => s.nodes);\n \n  const connections = useNodeConnections({\n    handleType: 'target',\n  });\n \n  const nodesData = useNodesData<CustomNodeType>(connections?.[0].source);\n \n  nodeData.forEach(({ type, data }) => {\n    if (type === 'number') {\n      // This is type safe because we have narrowed down the type\n      console.log(data.number);\n    }\n  });\n  // ...\n}\nType guards\n\nThere are multiple ways you can define type guards  in Typescript. One way is to define type guard functions like isNumberNode or isTextNode to filter out specific nodes from a list of nodes.\n\nfunction isNumberNode(node: CustomNodeType): node is NumberNode {\n  return node.type === 'number';\n}\n \n// numberNodes is of type NumberNode[]\nconst numberNodes = nodes.filter(isNumberNode);\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nTesting\nUncontrolled Flow\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Here are a few effective strategies to optimize the performance of React Flow.\n\nUse memoization\n\nOne of the main reasons for performance issues in React Flow is unnecessary re-renders. Since node movements trigger frequent state updates, this can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in larger diagrams.\n\nMemoize components\n\nComponents provided as props to the <ReactFlow> component, including custom node and edge components, should either be memoized using React.memo or declared outside the parent component. This ensures that React does not create a new reference for the component on every render, which would otherwise trigger unnecessary re-renders.\n\nconst NodeComponent = memo(() => {\n  return <div>{data.label}</div>;\n});\nMemoize functions\n\nSimilarly, functions passed as props to <ReactFlow> should be memoized using useCallback. This prevents React from creating a new function reference on every render, which could also trigger unnecessary re-renders. Additionally, arrays and objects like defaultEdgeOptions or snapGrid should be memoized using useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react';\n \nconst MyDiagram = () => {\n  const onNodeClick = useCallback((event, node) => {\n    console.log('Node clicked:', node);\n  }, []);\n \n  return <ReactFlow onNodeClick={onNodeClick} />;\n};\n \nexport default MyDiagram;\nAvoid accessing nodes in components\n\nOne of the most common performance pitfalls in React Flow is directly accessing the nodes or edges in the components or the viewport. These objects change frequently during operations like dragging, panning, or zooming, which can cause unnecessary re-renders of components that depend on them.\n\nFor example, if you fetch the entire nodes array from the store and filter it to display selected node IDs, this approach can lead to performance degradation. Every update to the nodes array triggers a re-render of all dependent components, even if the change is unrelated to the selected nodes.\n\nInefficient example\nconst SelectedNodeIds = () => {\n  // ❌ This will cause unnecessary re-renders!\n \n  const nodes = useStore((state) => state.nodes);\n \n  const selectedNodeIds = nodes.filter((node) => node.selected).map((node) => node.id);\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      {selectedNodeIds.map((id) => (\n        <div key={id}>{id}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nIn this example, every update to the nodes array causes the SelectedNodeIds component to re-render, even if the selection hasn’t changed.\n\nOptimized solution\n\nTo avoid unnecessary re-renders, store the selected nodes in a separate field in your state (using Zustand, Redux, or any other state management solution). This ensures that the component only re-renders when the selection changes.\n\nconst SelectedNodeIds = () => {\n  const selectedNodeIds = useStore((state) => state.selectedNodeIds);\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      {selectedNodeIds.map((id) => (\n        <div key={id}>{id}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nBy decoupling the selected nodes from the nodes array, you prevent unnecessary updates and improve performance. For more information, view our State Management guide.\n\nCollapse large node trees\n\nIf your node tree is deeply nested, rendering all nodes at once can be inefficient. Instead, show only a limited number of nodes and allow users to expand them as needed. You can do this by modifying the node’s hidden property dynamically to toggle visibility.\n\nconst handleNodeClick = (targetNode) => {\n  if (targetNode.data.children) {\n    setNodes((prevNodes) =>\n      prevNodes.map((node) =>\n        targetNode.data.children.includes(node.id)\n          ? { ...node, hidden: !node.hidden }\n          : node,\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nBy hiding nodes initially and rendering them only when expanded, we optimize performance while maintaining usability.\n\nSimplify node and edge styles\n\nIf you’ve optimized performance in every other way, and you are still finding performance issues with large numbers of nodes, complex CSS styles, particularly those involving animations, shadows, or gradients, can significantly impact performance. Consider reducing complexity on your node styles in these cases.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nHere are a few helpful resources on performance in React Flow that you can check out:\n\nGuide to Optimize React Flow Project Performance \nTuning Edge Animations ReactFlow Optimal Performance \n5 Ways to Optimize React Flow in 10 minutes \nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nUncontrolled Flow\nState Management\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

You should also be familiar with the concepts of state management libraries and how to use them.\n\nIn this guide, we explain how to use React Flow with the state management library Zustand . We will build a small app where each node features a color chooser that updates its background color. We chose Zustand for this guide because React Flow already uses it internally, but you can easily use other state management libraries such as Redux , Recoil  or Jotai \n\nAs demonstrated in previous guides and examples, React Flow can easily be used with a local component state to manage nodes and edges in your diagram. However, as your application grows and you need to update the state from within individual nodes, managing this state can become more complex. Instead of passing functions through the node’s data field, you can use a React context  or integrate a state management library like Zustand, as outlined in this guide.\n\nInstall Zustand\n\nAs mentioned above we are using Zustand in this example. Zustand is a bit like Redux: you have a central store with actions to alter your state and hooks to access your state. You can install Zustand via:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add zustand\nCreate a store\n\nZustand lets you create a hook for accessing the values and functions of your store. We put the nodes and edges and the onNodesChange, onEdgesChange, onConnect, setNodes and setEdges functions in the store to get the basic interactivity for our graph:\n\nThat’s the basic setup. We now have a store with nodes and edges that can handle the changes (dragging, selecting or removing a node or edge) triggered by React Flow. When you take a look at the App.tsx file, you can see that it’s kept nice and clean. All the data and actions are now part of the store and can be accessed with the useStore hook.\n\nImplement a color change action\n\nWe add a new updateNodeColor action to update the data.color field of a specific node. For this we pass the node id and the new color to the action, iterate over the nodes and update the matching one with the new color:\n\nupdateNodeColor: (nodeId: string, color: string) => {\n  set({\n    nodes: get().nodes.map((node) => {\n      if (node.id === nodeId) {\n        // it's important to create a new object here, to inform React Flow about the changes\n        return { ...node, data: { ...node.data, color } };\n      }\n \n      return node;\n    }),\n  });\n};\n\nThis new action can now be used in a React component like this:\n\nconst updateNodeColor = useStore((s) => s.updateNodeColor);\n...\n<button onClick={() => updateNodeColor(nodeId, color)} />;\nAdd a color chooser node\n\nIn this step we implement the ColorChooserNode component and call the updateNodeColor when the user changes the color. The custom part of the color chooser node is the color input.\n\n<input\n  type=\"color\"\n  defaultValue={data.color}\n  onChange={(evt) => updateNodeColor(id, evt.target.value)}\n  className=\"nodrag\"\n/>\n\nWe add the nodrag class name so that the user doesn’t drag the node by mistake when changing the color and call the updateNodeColor in the onChange event handler.\n\nYou can now click on a color chooser and change the background of a node.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nPerformance\nComputing Flows\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Instead, in this guide we’ll show you how to compute data flows directly inside of React Flow. You can use this for updating a node based on connected data, or for building an app that runs entirely inside the browser.\n\nWhat are we going to build?\n\nBy the end of this guide, you will build an interactive flow graph that generates a color out of three separate number input fields (red, green and blue), and determines whether white or black text would be more readable on that background color.\n\nCreating custom nodes\n\nLet’s start by creating a custom input node (NumberInput.js) and add three instances of it. We will be using a controlled <input type=\"number\" /> and limit it to integer numbers between 0 - 255 inside the onChange event handler.\n\nimport { useCallback, useState } from 'react';\nimport { Handle, Position } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nfunction NumberInput({ id, data }) {\n  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n \n  const onChange = useCallback((evt) => {\n    const cappedNumber = Math.round(\n      Math.min(255, Math.max(0, evt.target.value)),\n    );\n    setNumber(cappedNumber);\n  }, []);\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"number-input\">\n      <div>{data.label}</div>\n      <input\n        id={`number-${id}`}\n        name=\"number\"\n        type=\"number\"\n        min=\"0\"\n        max=\"255\"\n        onChange={onChange}\n        className=\"nodrag\"\n        value={number}\n      />\n      <Handle type=\"source\" position={Position.Right} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default NumberInput;\n\nNext, we’ll add a new custom node (ColorPreview.js) with one target handle for each color channel and a background that displays the resulting color. We can use mix-blend-mode: 'difference'; to make the text color always readable.\n\nWhenever you have multiple handles of the same kind on a single node, don’t forget to give each one a separate id!\n\nLet’s also add edges going from the input nodes to the color node to our initialEdges array while we are at it.\n\nComputing data\n\nHow do we get the data from the input nodes to the color node? This is a two step process that involves two hooks created for this exact purpose:\n\nStore each number input value inside the node’s data object with help of the updateNodeData callback.\nFind out which nodes are connected by using useNodeConnections and then use useNodesData for receiving the data from the connected nodes.\nStep 1: Writing values to the data object\n\nFirst let’s add some initial values for the input nodes inside the data object in our initialNodes array and use them as an initial state for the input nodes. Then we’ll grab the function updateNodeData from the useReactFlow hook and use it to update the data object of the node with a new value whenever the input changes.\n\nBy default, the data you pass to updateNodeData will be merged with the old data object. This makes it easier to do partial updates and saves you in case you forget to add {...data}. You can pass { replace: true } as an option to replace the object instead.\n\nWhen dealing with input fields you don’t want to use a nodes data object as UI state directly.\n\nThere is a delay in updating the data object and the cursor might jump around erratically and lead to unwanted inputs.\n\nStep 2: Getting data from connected nodes\n\nWe start by determining all connections for each node with the useNodeConnections hook and then fetching the data for the first connected node with updateNodeData.\n\nNote that each handle can have multiple nodes connected to it and you might want to restrict the number of connections to a single handle inside your application. Check out the connection limit example to see how to do that.\n\nAnd there you go! Try changing the input values and see the color change in real time.\n\nImproving the code\n\nIt might seem awkward to get the connections first, and then the data separately for each handle. For nodes with multiple handles like these, you should consider creating a custom handle component that isolates connection states and node data binding. We can create one inline.\n\nColorPreview.js\n// {...}\nfunction CustomHandle({ id, label, onChange }) {\n  const connections = useNodeConnections({\n    handleType: 'target',\n    handleId: id,\n  });\n \n  const nodeData = useNodesData(connections?.[0].source);\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    onChange(nodeData?.data ? nodeData.data.value : 0);\n  }, [nodeData]);\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Handle\n        type=\"target\"\n        position={Position.Left}\n        id={id}\n        className=\"handle\"\n      />\n      <label htmlFor=\"red\" className=\"label\">\n        {label}\n      </label>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nWe can promote color to local state and declare each handle like this:\n\nColorPreview.js\n// {...}\nfunction ColorPreview() {\n  const [color, setColor] = useState({ r: 0, g: 0, b: 0 });\n \n  return (\n    <div\n      className=\"node\"\n      style={{\n        background: `rgb(${color.r}, ${color.g}, ${color.b})`,\n      }}\n    >\n      <CustomHandle\n        id=\"red\"\n        label=\"R\"\n        onChange={(value) => setColor((c) => ({ ...c, r: value }))}\n      />\n      <CustomHandle\n        id=\"green\"\n        label=\"G\"\n        onChange={(value) => setColor((c) => ({ ...c, g: value }))}\n      />\n      <CustomHandle\n        id=\"blue\"\n        label=\"B\"\n        onChange={(value) => setColor((c) => ({ ...c, b: value }))}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default ColorPreview;\nGetting more complex\n\nNow we have a simple example of how to pipe data through React Flow. What if we want to do something more complex, like transforming the data along the way? Or even take different paths? We can do that too!\n\nContinuing the flow\n\nLet’s extend our flow. Start by adding an output <Handle type=\"source\" position={Position.Right} /> to the color node and remove the local component state.\n\nBecause there are no inputs fields on this node, we don’t need to keep a local state at all. We can just read and update the node’s data object directly.\n\nNext, we add a new node (Lightness.js) that takes in a color object and determines if it is either a light or dark color. We can use the relative luminance formula  luminance = 0.2126 * color.r + 0.7152 * color.g + 0.0722 * color.b to calculate the perceived brightness of a color (0 being the darkest and 255 being the brightest). We can assume everything >= 128 is a light color.\n\nConditional branching\n\nWhat if we would like to take a different path in our flow based on the perceived lightness? Let’s give our lightness node two source handles light and dark and separate the node data object by source handle IDs. This is needed if you have multiple source handles to distinguish between each source handle’s data.\n\nBut what does it mean to “take a different route”? One solution would be to assume that null or undefined data hooked up to a target handle is considered a “stop”. In our case we can write the incoming color into data.values.light if it’s a light color and into data.values.dark if it’s a dark color and set the respective other value to null.\n\nDon’t forget to add flex-direction: column; and align-items: end; to reposition the handle labels.\n\nCool! Now we only need a last node to see if it actually works… We can create a custom debugging node (Log.js) that displays the hooked up data, and we’re done!\n\nSummary\n\nYou have learned how to move data through the flow and transform it along the way. All you need to do is\n\nstore data inside the node’s data object with help of updateNodeData callback.\nfind out which nodes are connected by using useNodeConnections and then use useNodesData for receiving the data from the connected nodes.\n\nYou can implement branching for example by interpreting incoming data that is undefined as a “stop”. As a side note, most flow graphs that also have a branching usually separate the triggering of nodes from the actual data hooked up to the nodes. Unreal Engines Blueprints are a good example for this.\n\nOne last note before you go: you should find a consistent way of structuring all your node data, instead of mixing ideas like we did just now. This means for example, if you start working with splitting data by handle ID you should do it for all nodes, regardless whether they have multiple handles or not. Being able to make assumptions about the structure of your data throughout your flow will make life a lot easier.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nState Management\nServer Side Rendering\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

While we are working on the actual package, we’d love to hear about your feedback and ideas on Discord  or via mail at info@xyflow.com.\n\nReact Flow can often seem like a magic black box, but in reality you can reveal quite a lot about its internal state if you know where to look. In this guide we will show you three different ways to reveal the internal state of your flow:\n\nA <ViewportLogger /> component that shows the current position and zoom level of the viewport.\nA <NodeInspector /> component that reveals the state of each node.\nA <ChangeLogger /> that wraps your flow’s onNodesChange handler and logs each change as it is dispatched.\n\nWhile we find these tools useful for making sure React Flow is working properly, you might also find them useful for debugging your applications as your flows and their interactions become more complex.\n\nWe encourage you to copy any or all of the components from this example into your own projects and modify them to suit your needs: each component works independently!\n\nNode Inspector\n\nThe <NodeInspector /> component makes use of our useNodes hook to access all the nodes in the flow. Typically we discourage using this hook because it will trigger a re-render any time any of your nodes change, but that’s exactly what makes it so useful for debugging!\n\nThe width and height properties are added to each node by React Flow after it has measured the node’s dimensions. We pass those dimensions, as well as other information like the node’s id and type, to a custom <NodeInfo /> component.\n\nWe make use of the <ViewportPortal /> component to let us render the inspector into React Flow’s viewport. That means it’s content will be positioned and transformed along with the rest of the flow as the user pans and zooms.\n\nChange Logger\n\nAny change to your nodes and edges that originates from React Flow itself is communicated to you through the onNodesChange and onEdgesChange callbacks. If you are working with a controlled flow (that means you’re managing the nodes and edges yourself), you need to apply those changes to your state in order to keep everything in sync.\n\nThe <ChangeLogger /> component wraps your user-provided onNodesChange handler with a custom function that intercepts and logs each change as it is dispatched. We can do this by using the useStore and useStoreApi hooks to access the store and and then update React Flow’s internal state accordingly. These two hooks give you powerful access to React Flow’s internal state and methods.\n\nBeyond debugging, using the <ChangeLogger /> can be a great way to learn more about how React Flow works and get you thinking about the different functionality you can build on top of each change.\n\nYou can find documentation on the NodeChange and EdgeChange types in the API reference.\n\nViewport Logger\n\nThe <ViewportLogger /> is the simplest example of what state you can pull out of React Flow’s store if you know what to look for. The state of the viewport is stored internally under the transform key (a name we inherited from d3-zoom ). This component extracts the x, y, and zoom components of the transform and renders them into a <Panel /> component.\n\nLet us know what you think\n\nAs mentioned above, if you have any feedback or ideas on how to improve the devtools, please let us know on Discord  or via mail at info@xyflow.com. If you build your own devtools using these ideas, we’d love to hear about it!\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nServer Side Rendering\nMultiplayer\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Contact Us \n\nWhat's new?\n\nReact Flow 12.10.1\nReact Flow 12.10.0\nReact Flow UI Components updated to React 19 and Tailwind CSS 4\n...and more!\nReact Flow Playground\n\nExplore different props, options and layout algorithms in our interactive playground\n\nLaunch\nLearn\nAdvanced Use\nServer Side Rendering\nCopy page\nServer side rendering, server side generation\nServer side rendering is supported since React Flow 12\n\nThis is an advanced use case and assumes you are already familiar with React Flow. If you’re new to React Flow, check out our getting started guide.\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to configure React Flow to render a flow on the server, which will allow you to\n\nDisplay static HTML diagrams in documentation\nRender React Flow diagrams in non-js environments\nDynamically generate open graph images that appear as embeds when sharing a link to your flow\n\n(If you want to download an image of your flow, there’s an easier way to do that on the client-side in our download image example.)\n\nNode dimensions\n\nYou need to configure a few things to make React Flow work on the server, the most important being the node dimensions. React Flow only renders nodes if they have a width and height. Usually you pass nodes without a specific width and height, they are then measured and the dimensions get written to measured.width and measured.height. Since we can’t measure the dimensions on the server, we need to pass them explicitly. This can be done with the width and height or the initialWidth and initialHeight node properties.\n\nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    type: 'default',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    data: { label: 'Node 1' },\n    width: 100,\n    height: 50,\n  },\n];\n\nReact Flow now knows the dimensions of the node and can render it on the server. The width and height properties are used as an inline style for the node. If you expect nodes to have different dimensions on the client or if the dimensions should by dynamic based on the content, you can use the initialWidth and initialHeight properties. They are only used for the first render (on the server or on the client) as long as the nodes are not measured and measured.width and measured.height are not set.\n\nThere are two ways to specify node dimensions for server side rendering:\n\nwidth and height for static dimensions that are known in advance and don’t change.\ninitialWidth and initialHeight for dynamic dimensions that are not known in advance or change.\nHandle positions\n\nYou probably also want to render the edges on the server. On the client, React Flow checks the positions of the handles and stores that information to draw the edges. Since we can’t measure the handle positions on the server, we need to pass this information, too. This can be done with the handles property of a node.\n\nconst nodes: Node[] = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    type: 'default',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    data: { label: 'Node 1' },\n    width: 100,\n    height: 50,\n    handles: [\n      {\n        type: 'target',\n        position: Position.Top,\n        x: 100 / 2,\n        y: 0,\n      },\n      {\n        type: 'source',\n        position: Position.Bottom,\n        x: 100 / 2,\n        y: 50,\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n\nWith this additional information, React Flow knows enough about the handles to render the edges on the server. If you are fine with just rendering the nodes, you can skip this step.\n\nUsing fitView on the server\n\nIf you know the dimensions of the React Flow container itself, you can even use fitView on the server. For this, you need to pass the width and height of the container to the ReactFlow component.\n\n<ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={edges} fitView width={1000} height={500} />\n\nThis will calculate the viewport and set the transform on the server in order to include all nodes in the viewport.\n\nUsage with the <ReactFlowProvider>\n\nIf you are using the ReactFlowProvider, you can pass initialNodes, initialEdges and optional wrapper dimensions (initialWidth and initialHeight) and fitView to the provider.\n\n<ReactFlowProvider\n  initialNodes={nodes}\n  initialEdges={edges}\n  initialWidth={1000}\n  initialHeight={500}\n  fitView\n>\n  <App />\n</ReactFlowProvider>\n\nThe initial- prefix means that these values are only used for the first render. After that, the provider will use the nodes and edges from the context.\n\nCreating static HTML\n\nIf you want to create static HTML, you can use the renderToStaticMarkup function from React. This will render the React Flow component to a string of HTML. You can then use this string to create a static HTML file or send it as a response to an HTTP request.\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server';\nimport { ReactFlow, Background } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nfunction toHTML({ nodes, edges, width, height }) {\n  const html = renderToStaticMarkup(\n    React.createElement(\n      ReactFlow,\n      {\n        nodes,\n        edges,\n        width,\n        height,\n        minZoom: 0.2,\n        fitView: true,\n      },\n      React.createElement(Background, null),\n    ),\n  );\n \n  return html;\n}\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nComputing Flows\nDevtools\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

For collaborative features, this usually means that there is no satisfying “middle-ground” solution like sparsely synchronising the state between users, because it would break visual consistency or make collaborative exploration more complicated. Often, a full live multiplayer system needs to be put in place.\n\nIn our Collaborative Flow Pro Example, we show a realtime multiplayer collaboration flow using React Flow and Yjs . In this guide, we will explore some best practices for integrating multiplayer collaboration in your React Flow application.\n\nWhat are multiplayer applications?\n\nAlthough realtime collaboration would be the correct term here, we refer to it as multiplayer, which was most likely popularized in this context by Figma. Besides being more intuitive for marketing purposes, it also does a better job of communicating the commitment to creating something truly realtime by putting it in the same category as competitive video games.\n\nTo figure out what degree of collaboration your application supports, you just need to look at how closely it resembles a multiplayer game. These features likely include:\n\nNo manual saving is required; all users share a world where actions are persisted.\nAny changes made by other users are immediately visible to you.\nNot only completed actions, but transitive states are synced too (e.g. dragging a node, not only when the node is dropped).\nYou can see other users (e.g. their cursors or viewport positions)\nA word of caution\n\nMaking multiplayer applications is hard! When users are collaboratively editing shared objects, conflicts, delays, connection drops and concurrent operations are expected. The hardest challenge in multiplayer apps is conflict-resolution: you always need some kind of sync engine that is able to merge any changes coming from the server (or other clients) into the (often optimistic) client state. You need to gracefully handle conflicts and disconnects. You need to build a reliable network layer.\n\nThe simplest sync engine for multiplayer would be a “first-come-first-served” approach, and failed requests and messages sent being ignored. If you try to manually handle this, you will see a quite vast variety of edge cases emerge. Networks are slow, clients disconnect, and the order of actions matters.\n\nLocal-first and CRDTs\n\nDepending on how far you want to take handling conflicts and disconnects, you very quickly land in local-first territory. When your sync engine allows a user to be disconnected for an indefinite amount of time, you have a local-first application. If you would like a good primer on this topic we recommend Ink & Switch’s essay  that coined the term.\n\nA CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) is a data structure that lets multiple users edit the same data simultaneously on different devices, then automatically merges all changes without conflicts—no central server needed. Instead of just storing the current value of the data, CRDTs keep operation history on every connected client, so any replica can merge changes into the same final state, regardless of the order updates arrive. They are thus solving the conflicts and disconnects by being multi-replica synced data structures that can work completely offline, and automatically upload, fetch, and reconcile their state on reconnection.\n\nA couple of popular solutions are Yjs , Automerge  and Loro .\n\nWhat React Flow state should I sync?\n\nAmong your first considerations should be how you want to sync what parts of the local state of your app.\n\nEphemeral vs Durable\n\nWhile there are many ways to sync state between clients, we can categorize them into two groups: ephemeral and durable (aka atomic) changes. Ephemeral changes are not persisted and neither its consistency nor its correctness is very important for the functionality of the application. These are things like cursor or viewport positions or any transient interaction state. Missing some of these updates will not break anything and in case of a connection loss, a client can just listen for the newest changes and restore any lost functionality.\n\nOn the other hand, updates to the nodes & edges should be persistent and consistent! Imagine if Alice deletes a node and Bob misses this update. Now if Bob subsequently moves the node, we would have an inconsistent application state. For this kind of data we have to use a solution that handles disconnects more aggressively and is able to discard impossible actions like moving a deleted node.\n\nAt the core of a multiplayer React Flow application is syncing the nodes and edges. However not all parts of the state should be synced. For instance, what nodes and edges are selected should be different for each client. Also there are some fields that are relevant for the certain library functions like dragging, resizing or measured.\n\nThis is an overview of what parts are recommended to sync and what not.\n\nNodes\nField\tDurable\tEphemeral\tExplanation\nid\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\ntype\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\ndata\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\nposition\t✅\t✳️\tImportant, includes transient state\nwidth, height\t✅\t✳️\tImportant, includes transient state\ndragging\t❌\t✅\tTransient interaction state\nresizing\t❌\t✅\tTransient interaction state\nselected\t❌\t❌\tPer-user UI state\nmeasured\t❌\t❌\tComputed from DOM\nEdges\nField\tDurable\tEphemeral\tExplanation\nid\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\ntype\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\ndata\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\nsource\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\ntarget\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\nsourceHandle\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\ntargetHandle\t✅\t❌\tImportant, always needs to be in-sync\nselected\t❌\t❌\tPer-user UI state\nConnections and Cursors\n\nGood examples of ephemeral data are connections (the transient part of edges being created) and cursors.\n\nSharing each user’s connections status improves visual consistency across clients, but losing this state on disconnect doesn’t affect the correctness of the shared data: it’s purely presentational.\n\nThe same applies to cursors. They help create the immersion of a shared workspace, but they’re not essential to the application’s integrity. As long as the nodes and edges remain in sync, cursor state can be safely discarded.\n\nBoth can be shared as purely ephemeral state. If you want to reduce the frequency of live updates, you can debounce the updates and smooth the movements of other users’ cursors. You can use a library like perfect-cursors  to smooth the movements of other users’ cursors.\n\nThird Party Libraries and Services\n\nWe experimented with different multiplayer backend solutions to understand their best use cases for React Flow apps. What we found out, is that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. The choice between CRDT-based local-first libraries (like Yjs  and Jazz ) and server-authoritative approaches (like Supabase  and Convex ) will change the way you approach building multiplayer React Flow applications:\n\nCRDT libraries will make your life easier around offline-first multiplayer support, giving you for-free automatic conflict resolution, but in the case where your application is also structured around a database, you will need to implement your own adapters between the CRDT library and the database.\nServer-authoritative solutions are easier to use with a database and classical application logic, but will complicate your life around offline-first multiplayer support, conflict resolution, and development complexity.\nName\tArchitecture\tOffline Support\tConflict Resolution\tNotes\nYjs\tCRDT (Local-first)\t✅ Full offline support\tAutomatic (CRDT)\tCollaborative editing, offline-first CRDT for local-first apps, with a React Flow Pro Example\nJazz\tCRDT (Local-first)\t✅ Full offline support\tAutomatic (CRDT)\tA full, offline-first database solution that handles multiplayer natively.\nSupabase\tServer-authoritative\t❌ Requires connection\tManual/RLS policies\tClassic SQL-based database solution, with realtime support, but no CRDT (conflict resolution must be implemented manually).\nConvex\tServer-authoritative\t❌ Requires connection\tOptimistic \tTypeScript-first, database solution with real-time queries and a sync-engine with some conflict resolution capabilities.

There were lots of useful bits built into this slideshow app, so we wanted to share how we built it!\n\nOur 2023 end of year survey app was made up of many static nodes and buttons to navigate between them.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have built a presentation app with\n\nSupport for markdown slides\nKeyboard navigation around the viewport\nAutomatic layouting\nClick-drag panning navigation (à la Prezi)\n\nAlong the way, you’ll learn a bit about the basics of layouting algorithms, creating static flows, and custom nodes.\n\nOnce you’re done, the app will look like this!\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of React  and React Flow, but if you get stuck on the way feel free to reach out to us on Discord !\n\nHere’s the repo with the final code  if you’d like to skip ahead or refer to it as we go.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nSetting up the project\n\nWe like to recommend using Vite  when starting new React Flow projects, and this time we’ll use TypeScript too. You can scaffold a new project with the following command:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nnpm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts\n# couldn't auto-convert command\n\nIf you’d prefer to follow along with JavaScript feel free to use the react template instead. You can also follow along in your browser by using our Codesandbox templates:\n\nJS\nnew.reactflow.dev/js\nTS\nnew.reactflow.dev/ts\n\nBesides React Flow we only need to pull in one dependency, react-remark, to help us render markdown in our slides.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add @xyflow/react react-remark\n\nWe’ll modify the generated main.tsx to include React Flow’s styles, as well as wrap the app in a <ReactFlowProvider /> to make sure we can access the React Flow instance inside our components;\n\nmain.tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';\nimport { ReactFlowProvider } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport App from './App';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\nimport './index.css';\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <ReactFlowProvider>\n      {/* The parent element of the React Flow component needs a width and a height\n          to work properly. If you're styling your app as you follow along, you\n          can remove this div and apply styles to the #root element in your CSS.\n       */}\n      <div style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }}>\n        <App />\n      </div>\n    </ReactFlowProvider>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n);\n\nThis tutorial is going to gloss over the styling of the app, so feel free to use any CSS framework or styling solution you’re familiar with. If you’re going to style your app differently from just writing CSS, Tailwind CSS, you can skip the import to index.css.\n\nHow you style your app is up to you, but you must always include React Flow’s styles! If you don’t need the default styles, at a minimum you should include the base styles from @xyflow/react/dist/base.css.\n\nEach slide of our presentation will be a node on the canvas, so let’s create a new file Slide.tsx that will be our custom node used to render each slide.\n\nSlide.tsx\nimport { type Node, type NodeProps } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport const SLIDE_WIDTH = 1920;\nexport const SLIDE_HEIGHT = 1080;\n \nexport type SlideNode = Node<SlideData, 'slide'>;\n \nexport type SlideData = {};\n \nconst style = {\n  width: `${SLIDE_WIDTH}px`,\n  height: `${SLIDE_HEIGHT}px`,\n} satisfies React.CSSProperties;\n \nexport function Slide({ data }: NodeProps<SlideNode>) {\n  return (\n    <article className=\"slide nodrag\" style={style}>\n      <div>Hello, React Flow!</div>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\nWe’re setting the slide width and height as constants here (rather than styling the node in CSS) because we’ll want access to those dimensions later on. We’ve also stubbed out the SlideData type so we can properly type the component’s props.\n\nThe last thing to do is to register our new custom node and show something on the screen.\n\nApp.tsx\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { Slide } from './Slide.tsx';\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  slide: Slide,\n};\n \nexport default function App() {\n  const nodes = [{ id: '0', type: 'slide', position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: {} }];\n \n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} nodeTypes={nodeTypes} fitView />;\n}\n\nIt’s important to remember to define your nodeTypes object outside of the component (or to use React’s useMemo hook)! When the nodeTypes object changes, the entire flow is re-rendered.\n\nWith the basics put together, you can start the development server by running npm run dev and see the following:\n\nNot super exciting yet, but let’s add markdown rendering and create a few slides side by side!\n\nRendering markdown\n\nWe want to make it easy to add content to our slides, so we’d like the ability to write Markdown  in our slides. If you’re not familiar, Markdown is a simple markup language for creating formatted text documents. If you’ve ever written a README on GitHub, you’ve used Markdown!\n\nThanks to the react-remark package we installed earlier, this step is a simple one. We can use the <Remark /> component to render a string of markdown content into our slides.\n\nSlide.tsx\nimport { type Node, type NodeProps } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { Remark } from 'react-remark';\n \nexport const SLIDE_WIDTH = 1920;\nexport const SLIDE_HEIGHT = 1080;\n \nexport type SlideNode = Node<SlideData, 'slide'>;\n \nexport type SlideData = {\n  source: string;\n};\n \nconst style = {\n  width: `${SLIDE_WIDTH}px`,\n  height: `${SLIDE_HEIGHT}px`,\n} satisfies React.CSSProperties;\n \nexport function Slide({ data }: NodeProps<SlideNode>) {\n  return (\n    <article className=\"slide nodrag\" style={style}>\n      <Remark>{data.source}</Remark>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\nIn React Flow, nodes can have data stored on them that can be used during rendering. In this case we’re storing the markdown content to display by adding a source property to the SlideData type and passing that to the <Remark /> component. We can update our hardcoded nodes with some markdown content to see it in action:\n\nApp.tsx\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { Slide, SLIDE_WIDTH } from './Slide';\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  slide: Slide,\n};\n \nexport default function App() {\n  const nodes = [\n    {\n      id: '0',\n      type: 'slide',\n      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n      data: { source: '# Hello, React Flow!' },\n    },\n    {\n      id: '1',\n      type: 'slide',\n      position: { x: SLIDE_WIDTH, y: 0 },\n      data: { source: '...' },\n    },\n    {\n      id: '2',\n      type: 'slide',\n      position: { x: SLIDE_WIDTH * 2, y: 0 },\n      data: { source: '...' },\n    },\n  ];\n \n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} nodeTypes={nodeTypes} fitView minZoom={0.1} />;\n}\n\nNote that we’ve added the minZoom prop to the <ReactFlow /> component. Our slides are quite large, and the default minimum zoom level is not enough to zoom out and see multiple slides at once.\n\nIn the nodes array above, we’ve made sure to space the slides out by doing some manual math with the SLIDE_WIDTH constant. In the next section we’ll come up with an algorithm to automatically lay out the slides in a grid.\n\nLaying out the nodes\n\nWe often get asked how to automatically lay out nodes in a flow, and we have some documentation on how to use common layouting libraries like dagre and d3-hierarchy in our layouting guide. Here you’ll be writing your own super-simple layouting algorithm, which gets a bit nerdy, but stick with us!\n\nFor our presentation app we’ll construct a simple grid layout by starting from 0,0 and updating the x or y coordinates any time we have a new slide to the left, right, up, or down.\n\nFirst, we need to update our SlideData type to include optional ids for the slides to the left, right, up, and down of the current slide.\n\nSlide.tsx\nexport type SlideData = {\n  source: string;\n  left?: string;\n  up?: string;\n  down?: string;\n  right?: string;\n};\n\nStoring this information on the node data directly gives us some useful benefits:\n\nWe can write fully declarative slides without worrying about the concept of nodes and edges\n\nWe can compute the layout of the presentation by visiting connecting slides\n\nWe can add navigation buttons to each slide to navigate between them automatically. We’ll handle that in a later step.\n\nThe magic happens in a function we’re going to define called slidesToElements. This function will take an object containing all our slides addressed by their id, and an id for the slide to start at. Then it will work through each connecting slide to build an array of nodes and edges that we can pass to the <ReactFlow /> component.\n\nThe algorithm will go something like this:\n\nPush the initial slide’s id and the position { x: 0, y: 0 } onto a stack.\nWhile that stack is not empty…\n\nPop the current position and slide id off the stack.\n\nLook up the slide data by id.\n\nPush a new node onto the nodes array with the current id, position, and slide data.\n\nAdd the slide’s id to a set of visited slides.\n\nFor every direction (left, right, up, down)…\n\nMake sure the slide has not already been visited.\n\nTake the current position and update the x or y coordinate by adding or subtracting SLIDE_WIDTH or SLIDE_HEIGHT depending on the direction.\n\nPush the new position and the new slide’s id onto a stack.\n\nPush a new edge onto the edges array connecting the current slide to the new slide.\n\nRepeat for the remaining directions…\n\nIf all goes to plan, we should be able to take a stack of slides shown below and turn them into a neatly laid out grid!\n\nLet’s see the code. In a file called slides.ts add the following:\n\nslides.ts\nimport { SlideData, SLIDE_WIDTH, SLIDE_HEIGHT } from './Slide';\n \nexport const slidesToElements = (initial: string, slides: Record<string, SlideData>) => {\n  // Push the initial slide's id and the position `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` onto a stack.\n  const stack = [{ id: initial, position: { x: 0, y: 0 } }];\n  const visited = new Set();\n  const nodes = [];\n  const edges = [];\n \n  // While that stack is not empty...\n  while (stack.length) {\n    // Pop the current position and slide id off the stack.\n    const { id, position } = stack.pop();\n    // Look up the slide data by id.\n    const data = slides[id];\n    const node = { id, type: 'slide', position, data };\n \n    // Push a new node onto the nodes array with the current id, position, and slide\n    // data.\n    nodes.push(node);\n    // add the slide's id to a set of visited slides.\n    visited.add(id);\n \n    // For every direction (left, right, up, down)...\n    // Make sure the slide has not already been visited.\n    if (data.left && !visited.has(data.left)) {\n      // Take the current position and update the x or y coordinate by adding or\n      // subtracting `SLIDE_WIDTH` or `SLIDE_HEIGHT` depending on the direction.\n      const nextPosition = {\n        x: position.x - SLIDE_WIDTH,\n        y: position.y,\n      };\n \n      // Push the new position and the new slide's id onto a stack.\n      stack.push({ id: data.left, position: nextPosition });\n      // Push a new edge onto the edges array connecting the current slide to the\n      // new slide.\n      edges.push({ id: `${id}->${data.left}`, source: id, target: data.left });\n    }\n \n    // Repeat for the remaining directions...\n  }\n \n  return { nodes, edges };\n};\n\nWe’ve left out the code for the right, up, and down directions for brevity, but the logic is the same for each direction. We’ve also included the same breakdown of the algorithm as comments, to help you navigate the code.\n\nBelow is a demo app of the layouting algorithm, you can edit the slides object to see how adding slides to different directions affects the layout. For example, try extending 4’s data to include down: '5' and see how the layout updates.\n\nIf you spend a little time playing with this demo, you’ll likely run across two limitations of this algorithm:\n\nIt is possible to construct a layout that overlaps two slides in the same position.\n\nThe algorithm will ignore nodes that cannot be reached from the initial slide.\n\nAddressing these shortcomings is totally possible, but a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you give a shot, be sure to share your solution with us on the discord server !\n\nWith our layouting algorithm written, we can hop back to App.tsx and remove the hardcoded nodes array in favor of the new slidesToElements function.\n\nApp.tsx\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { slidesToElements } from './slides';\nimport { Slide, SlideData, SLIDE_WIDTH } from './Slide';\n \nconst slides: Record<string, SlideData> = {\n  '0': { source: '# Hello, React Flow!', right: '1' },\n  '1': { source: '...', left: '0', right: '2' },\n  '2': { source: '...', left: '1' },\n};\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  slide: Slide,\n};\n \nconst initialSlide = '0';\nconst { nodes, edges } = slidesToElements(initialSlide, slides);\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={nodes}\n      nodeTypes={nodeTypes}\n      fitView\n      fitViewOptions={{ nodes: [{ id: initialSlide }] }}\n      minZoom={0.1}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nThe slides in our flow are static, so we can move the slidesToElements call outside the component to make sure we’re not recalculating the layout if the component re-renders. Alternatively, you could use React’s useMemo hook to define things inside the component but only calculate them once.\n\nBecause we have the idea of an “initial” slide now, we’re also using the fitViewOptions to ensure the initial slide is the one that is focused when the canvas is first loaded.\n\nNavigating between slides\n\nSo far we have our presentation laid out in a grid but we have to manually pan the canvas to see each slide, which isn’t very practical for a presentation! We’re going to add three different ways to navigate between slides:\n\nClick-to-focus on nodes for jumping to different slides by clicking on them.\n\nNavigation buttons on each slide for moving sequentially between slides in any valid direction.\n\nKeyboard navigation using the arrow keys for moving around the presentation without using the mouse or interacting with a slide directly.\n\nFocus on click\n\nThe <ReactFlow /> element can receive an onNodeClick callback that fires when any node is clicked. Along with the mouse event itself, we also receive a reference to the node that was clicked on, and we can use that to pan the canvas thanks to the fitView method.\n\nfitView is a method on the React Flow instance, and we can get access to it by using the useReactFlow hook.\n\nApp.tsx\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow, useReactFlow, type NodeMouseHandler } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { Slide, SlideData, SLIDE_WIDTH } from './Slide';\n \nconst slides: Record<string, SlideData> = {\n  ...\n}\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  slide: Slide,\n};\n \nconst initialSlide = '0';\nconst { nodes, edges } = slidesToElements(initialSlide, slides);\n \nexport default function App() {\n  const { fitView } = useReactFlow();\n  const handleNodeClick = useCallback<NodeMouseHandler>(\n    (_, node) => {\n      fitView({ nodes: [node], duration: 150 });\n    },\n    [fitView],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      ...\n      fitViewOptions={{ nodes: [{ id: initialSlide }] }}\n      onNodeClick={handleNodeClick}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nIt’s important to remember to include fitView as in the dependency array of our handleNodeClick callback. That’s because the fitView function is replaced once React Flow has initialized the viewport. If you forget this step you’ll likely find out that handleNodeClick does nothing at all (and yes, we also forget this ourselves sometimes too 🫠 ).\n\nCalling fitView with no arguments would attempt to fit every node in the graph into view, but we only want to focus on the node that was clicked! The FitViewOptions object lets us provide an array of just the nodes we want to focus on: in this case, that’s just the node that was clicked.\n\nSlide controls\n\nClicking to focus a node is handy for zooming out to see the big picture before focusing back in on a specific slide, but it’s not a very practical way for navigating around a presentation. In this step we’ll add some controls to each slide that allow us to move to a connected slide in any direction.\n\nLet’s add a <footer> to each slide that conditionally renders a button in any direction with a connected slide. We’ll also preemptively create a moveToNextSlide callback that we’ll use in a moment.\n\nSlide.tsx\nimport { type NodeProps, fitView } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { Remark } from 'react-remark';\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\n \n...\n \nexport function Slide({ data }: NodeProps<SlideNide>) {\n  const moveToNextSlide = useCallback((id: string) => {}, []);\n \n  return (\n    <article className=\"slide nodrag\" style={style}>\n      <Remark>{data.source}</Remark>\n      <footer className=\"slide__controls nopan\">\n        {data.left && (<button onClick={() => moveToNextSlide(data.left)}>←</button>)}\n        {data.up && (<button onClick={() => moveToNextSlide(data.up)}>↑</button>)}\n        {data.down && (<button onClick={() => moveToNextSlide(data.down)}>↓</button>)}\n        {data.right && (<button onClick={() => moveToNextSlide(data.right)}>→</button>)}\n      </footer>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\nYou can style the footer however you like, but it’s important to add the \"nopan\" class to prevent prevent the canvas from panning as you interact with any of the buttons.\n\nTo implement moveToSlide, we’ll make use of fitView again. Previously we had a reference to the actual node that was clicked on to pass to fitView, but this time we only have a node’s id. You might be tempted to look up the target node by its id, but actually that’s not necessary! If we look at the type of FitViewOptions we can see that the array of nodes we pass in only needs to have an id property:\n\nhttps://reactflow.dev/api-reference/types/fit-view-options\nexport type FitViewOptions = {\n  padding?: number;\n  includeHiddenNodes?: boolean;\n  minZoom?: number;\n  maxZoom?: number;\n  duration?: number;\n  nodes?: (Partial<Node> & { id: Node['id'] })[];\n};\n\nPartial<Node> means that all of the fields of the Node object type get marked as optional, and then we intersect that with { id: Node['id'] } to ensure that the id field is always required. This means we can just pass in an object with an id property and nothing else, and fitView will know what to do with it!\n\nSlide.tsx\nimport { type NodeProps, useReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport function Slide({ data }: NodeProps<SlideNide>) {\n  const { fitView } = useReactFlow();\n \n  const moveToNextSlide = useCallback(\n    (id: string) => fitView({ nodes: [{ id }] }),\n    [fitView],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <article className=\"slide\" style={style}>\n      ...\n    </article>\n  );\n}\nKeyboard navigation\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to add keyboard navigation to our presentation. It’s not very convenient to have to always click on a slide to move to the next one, so we’ll add some keyboard shortcuts to make it easier. React Flow lets us listen to keyboard events on the <ReactFlow /> component through handlers like onKeyDown.\n\nUp until now the slide currently focused is implied by the position of the canvas, but if we want to handle key presses on the entire canvas we need to explicitly track the current slide. We need to this because we need to know which slide to navigate to when an arrow key is pressed!\n\nApp.tsx\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow, useReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { Slide, SlideData, SLIDE_WIDTH } from './Slide';\n \nconst slides: Record<string, SlideData> = {\n  ...\n}\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  slide: Slide,\n};\n \nconst initialSlide = '0';\nconst { nodes, edges } = slidesToElements(initialSlide, slides)\n \nexport default function App() {\n  const [currentSlide, setCurrentSlide] = useState(initialSlide);\n  const { fitView } = useReactFlow();\n \n  const handleNodeClick = useCallback<NodeMouseHandler>(\n    (_, node) => {\n      fitView({ nodes: [node] });\n      setCurrentSlide(node.id);\n    },\n    [fitView],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      ...\n      onNodeClick={handleNodeClick}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nHere we’ve added a bit of state, currentSlide, to our flow component and we’re making sure to update it whenever a node is clicked. Next, we’ll write a callback to handle keyboard events on the canvas:\n\nApp.tsx\nexport default function App() {\n  const [currentSlide, setCurrentSlide] = useState(initialSlide);\n  const { fitView } = useReactFlow();\n \n  ...\n \n  const handleKeyPress = useCallback<KeyboardEventHandler>(\n    (event) => {\n      const slide = slides[currentSlide];\n \n      switch (event.key) {\n        case 'ArrowLeft':\n        case 'ArrowUp':\n        case 'ArrowDown':\n        case 'ArrowRight':\n          const direction = event.key.slice(5).toLowerCase();\n          const target = slide[direction];\n \n          if (target) {\n            event.preventDefault();\n            setCurrentSlide(target);\n            fitView({ nodes: [{ id: target }] });\n          }\n      }\n    },\n    [currentSlide, fitView],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      ...\n      onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nTo save some typing we’re extracting the direction from the key pressed - if the user pressed 'ArrowLeft' we’ll get 'left' and so on. Then, if there is actually a slide connected in that direction we’ll update the current slide and call fitView to navigate to it!\n\nWe’re also preventing the default behavior of the arrow keys to prevent the window from scrolling up and down. This is necessary for this tutorial because the canvas is only one part of the page, but for an app where the canvas is the entire viewport you might not need to do this.\n\nAnd that’s everything! To recap let’s look at the final result and talk about what we’ve learned.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nEven if you’re not planning on making the next Prezi , we’ve still looked at a few useful features of React Flow in this tutorial:\n\nThe useReactFlow hook to access the fitView method.\n\nThe onNodeClick event handler to listen to clicks on every node in a flow.\n\nThe onKeyPress event handler to listen to keyboard events on the entire canvas.\n\nWe’ve also looked at how to implement a simple layouting algorithm ourselves. Layouting is a really common question we get asked about, but if your needs aren’t that complex you can get quite far rolling your own solution!\n\nIf you’re looking for ideas on how to extend this project, you could try addressing the issues we pointed out with the layouting algorithm, coming up with a more sophisticated Slide component with different layouts, or something else entirely.\n\nYou can use the completed source code  as a starting point, or you can just keep building on top of what we’ve made today. We’d love to see what you build so please share it with us over on our Discord server  or Twitter .\n\nGet Pro examples, prioritized bug reports, 1:1 support from the maintainers, and more with React Flow Pro\nReact Flow Pro\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nWhiteboard Features\nWeb Audio API\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

We’ll start from scratch, first learning about the Web Audio API before looking at how to handle many common scenarios in React Flow: state management, implementing custom nodes, and adding interactivity.\n\nThis is bleep.cafe. We're going to learn everything we need to know to build something just like it!\n\nA while back I shared a project I was working on to the React Flow discord server . It’s called bleep.cafe  and it’s a little web app for learning digital synthesis all inside the browser. A lot of folks were interested to see how something like that was put together: most people don’t even know their browser has a whole synth engine built in!\n\nThis tutorial will take us step-by-step to build something similar. We may skip over some bits here and there, but for the most part if you’re new to React Flow or the Web Audio API you should be able to follow along and have something working by the end.\n\nIf you’re already a React Flow wizard you might want to read the first section covering the Web Audio API and then jump to the third to see how things are tied together!\n\nBut first…\n\nA demo!\n\nThis and other examples in this tutorial make sound. To avoid creating an avant-garde masterpiece, remember to mute each example before moving on!\n\nThe Web Audio API\n\nBefore we get stuck in to React Flow and interactive node editor goodness, we need to take a crash course on the Web Audio API . Here are the highlights you need to know:\n\nThe Web Audio API provides a variety of different audio nodes, including sources (e.g. OscillatorNode , MediaElementAudioSourceNode ), effects (e.g. GainNode , DelayNode , ConvolverNode ), and outputs (e.g. AudioDestinationNode ).\nAudio nodes can be connected together to form a (potentially cyclic) graph. We tend to call this the audio-processing graph, signal graph, or signal chain.\nAudio processing is handled in a separate thread by native code. This means we can keep generating sounds even when the main UI thread is busy or blocked.\nAn AudioContext  acts as the brain of an audio-processing graph. We can use it to create new audio nodes and suspend or resume audio processing entirely.\nHello, sound!\n\nLet’s see some of this stuff in action and build our first Web Audio app! We won’t be doing anything too wild: we’ll make a simple mouse theremin . We’ll use React for these examples and everything else moving forward (we’re called React Flow after all!) and vite to handle bundling and hot reloading.\n\nIf you prefer another bundler like parcel or Create React App that’s cool too, they all do largely the same thing. You could also choose to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript. To keep things simple we won’t use it today, but React Flow is fully typed (and written entirely in TypeScript) so it’s a breeze to use!\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nnpm create vite@latest -- --template react\n# couldn't auto-convert command\n\nVite will scaffold out a simple React application for us, but can delete the assets and jump right into App.jsx. Remove the demo component generated for us and start by creating a new AudioContext and putting together the nodes we need. We want an OscillatorNode to generate some tones and a GainNode to control the volume.\n\n./src/App.jsx\n// Create the brain of our audio-processing graph\nconst context = new AudioContext();\n \n// Create an oscillator node to generate tones\nconst osc = context.createOscillator();\n \n// Create a gain node to control the volume\nconst amp = context.createGain();\n \n// Pass the oscillator's output through the gain node and to our speakers\nosc.connect(amp);\namp.connect(context.destination);\n \n// Start generating those tones!\nosc.start();\n\nOscillator nodes need to be started.\n\nDon’t forget that call to osc.start. The oscillator won’t start generating tones without it!\n\nFor our app, we’ll track the mouse’s position on the screen and use that to set the pitch of the oscillator node and the volume of the gain node.\n\n./src/App.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n \nconst context = new AudioContext();\nconst osc = context.createOscillator();\nconst amp = context.createGain();\n \nosc.connect(amp);\namp.connect(context.destination);\n \nosc.start();\n \nconst updateValues = (e) => {\n  const freq = (e.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 1000;\n  const gain = e.clientY / window.innerHeight;\n \n  osc.frequency.value = freq;\n  amp.gain.value = gain;\n};\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <div style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }} onMouseMove={updateValues} />;\n}\n\nosc.frequency.value, amp.gain.value…\n\nThe Web Audio API makes a distinction between simple object properties and audio node parameters. That distinction appears in the form of an AudioParam. You can read up on them in the MDN docs  but for now it’s enough to know that you need to use .value to set the value of an AudioParam rather than just assigning a value to the property directly.\n\nIf you try this example as it is, you’ll probably find that nothing happens. An AudioContext often starts in a suspended state in an attempt to avoid ads hijacking our speakers. We can fix that easily by adding a click handler on the <div /> to resume the context if it’s suspended.\n\n./src/App.jsx\nconst toggleAudio = () => {\n  if (context.state === 'suspended') {\n    context.resume();\n  } else {\n    context.suspend();\n  }\n};\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div ...\n      onClick={toggleAudio}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nAnd that’s everything we need to start making some sounds with the Web Audio API! Here’s what we put together, in case you weren’t following along at home:\n\nNow let’s put this knowledge to one side and take a look at how to build a React Flow project from scratch.\n\nAlready a React Flow pro? If you’re already familiar with React Flow, you can comfortably skip over the next section and head straight on over to making some sounds. For everyone else, let’s take a look at how to build a React Flow project from scratch.\n\nScaffolding a React Flow project\n\nLater on we’ll take what we’ve learned about the Web Audio API, oscillators, and gain nodes and use React Flow to interactively build audio-processing graphs. For now though, we need to put together an empty React Flow app.\n\nWe already have a React app set up with Vite, so we’ll keep using that. If you skipped over the last section, we ran npm create vite@latest -- --template react to get started. You can use whatever bundler and/or dev server you like, though. Nothing here is vite specific.\n\nWe only need three additional dependencies for this project: @xyflow/react for our UI (obviously!), zustand as our simple state management library (that’s what we use under the hood at React Flow) and nanoid as a lightweight id generator.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add @xyflow/react zustand nanoid\n\nWe’re going to remove everything from our Web Audio crash course and start from scratch. Start by modifying main.jsx to match the following:\n\n./src/main.jsx\nimport App from './App';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';\nimport { ReactFlowProvider } from '@xyflow/react';\n \n// 👇 Don't forget to import the styles!\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\nimport './index.css';\n \nconst root = document.querySelector('#root');\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    {/* React flow needs to be inside an element with a known height and width to work */}\n    <div style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }}>\n      <ReactFlowProvider>\n        <App />\n      </ReactFlowProvider>\n    </div>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n);\n\nThere are three important things to pay attention to here:\n\nYou need to remember to import the React Flow CSS styles to make sure everything works correctly.\nThe React Flow renderer needs to be inside an element with a known height and width, so we’ve set the containing <div /> to take up the entire screen.\nTo use some of the hooks React Flow provides, your components need to be inside a <ReactFlowProvider /> or inside the <ReactFlow /> component itself, so we’ve wrapped the entire app in the provider to be sure.\n\nNext, hop into App.jsx and create an empty flow:\n\n./src/App.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow, Background } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <ReactFlow>\n      <Background />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n\nWe’ll expand and add on to this component over time. For now, we’ve added one of React Flow’s built-in components - <Background /> - to check if everything is setup correctly. Go ahead and run npm run dev (or whatever you need to do to spin up a dev server if you didn’t choose vite) and check out your browser. You should see an empty flow:\n\nLeave the dev server running. We can keep checking back on our progress as we add new bits and bobs.\n\n1. State management with Zustand\n\nA Zustand store will hold all the UI state for our application. In practical terms that means it’ll hold the nodes and edges of our React Flow graph, a few other pieces of state, and a handful of actions to update that state.\n\nTo get a basic interactive React Flow graph going we need three actions:\n\nonNodesChange to handle nodes being moved around or deleted.\nonEdgesChange to handle edges being moved around or deleted.\naddEdge to connect two nodes in the graph.\n\nGo ahead and create a new file, store.js, and add the following:\n\n./src/store.js\nimport { applyNodeChanges, applyEdgeChanges } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { nanoid } from 'nanoid';\nimport { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional';\n \nexport const useStore = createWithEqualityFn((set, get) => ({\n  nodes: [],\n  edges: [],\n \n  onNodesChange(changes) {\n    set({\n      nodes: applyNodeChanges(changes, get().nodes),\n    });\n  },\n \n  onEdgesChange(changes) {\n    set({\n      edges: applyEdgeChanges(changes, get().edges),\n    });\n  },\n \n  addEdge(data) {\n    const id = nanoid(6);\n    const edge = { id, ...data };\n \n    set({ edges: [edge, ...get().edges] });\n  },\n}));\n\nZustand is dead simple to use. We create a function that receives both a set and a get function and returns an object with our initial state along with the actions we can use to update that state. Updates happen immutably and we can use the set function for that. The get function is how we read the current state. And… that’s it for zustand.\n\nThe changes argument in both onNodesChange and onEdgesChange represents events like a node or edge being moved or deleted. Fortunately, React Flow provides some helper functions to apply those changes for us. We just need to update the store with the new array of nodes.\n\naddEdge will be called whenever two nodes get connected. The data argument is almost a valid edge, it’s just missing an id. Here we’re getting nanoid to generate a 6 character random id and then adding the edge to our graph, nothing exciting.\n\nIf we hop back over to our <App /> component we can hook React Flow up to our actions and get something working.\n\n./src/App.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow, Background } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow';\n \nimport { useStore } from './store';\n \nconst selector = (store) => ({\n  nodes: store.nodes,\n  edges: store.edges,\n  onNodesChange: store.onNodesChange,\n  onEdgesChange: store.onEdgesChange,\n  addEdge: store.addEdge,\n});\n \nexport default function App() {\n  const store = useStore(selector, shallow);\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={store.nodes}\n      edges={store.edges}\n      onNodesChange={store.onNodesChange}\n      onEdgesChange={store.onEdgesChange}\n      onConnect={store.addEdge}\n    >\n      <Background />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n\nSo what’s this selector thing all about? Zustand let’s us supply a selector function to pluck out the exact bits of state we need from the store. Combined with the shallow equality function, this means we typically don’t have re-renders when state we don’t care about changes.\n\nRight now, our store is small and we actually want everything from it to help render our React Flow graph, but as we expand on it this selector will make sure we’re not re-rendering everything all the time.\n\nThis is everything we need to have an interactive graph: we can move nodes around, connect them together, and remove them. To demonstrate, temporarily add some dummy nodes to your store:\n\n./store.jsx\nconst useStore = createWithEqualityFn((set, get) => ({\n  nodes: [\n    { id: 'a', data: { label: 'oscillator' }, position: { x: 0, y: 0 } },\n    { id: 'b', data: { label: 'gain' }, position: { x: 50, y: 50 } },\n    { id: 'c', data: { label: 'output' }, position: { x: -50, y: 100 } }\n  ],\n  ...\n}));\n2. Custom nodes\n\nOK great, we have an interactive React Flow instance we can start playing with. We added some dummy nodes but they’re just the default unstyled ones right now. In this step we’ll add three custom nodes with interactive controls:\n\nAn oscillator node and controls for the pitch and waveform type.\nA gain node and a control for the volume\nAn output node and a button to toggle audio processing on and off.\n\nLet’s create a new folder, nodes/, and create a file for each custom node we want to create. Starting with the oscillator we need two controls and a source handle to connect the output of the oscillator to other nodes.\n\n./src/nodes/Osc.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Handle } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport { useStore } from '../store';\n \nexport default function Osc({ id, data }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <p>Oscillator Node</p>\n \n        <label>\n          <span>Frequency</span>\n          <input\n            className=\"nodrag\"\n            type=\"range\"\n            min=\"10\"\n            max=\"1000\"\n            value={data.frequency} />\n          <span>{data.frequency}Hz</span>\n        </label>\n \n        <label>\n          <span>Waveform</span>\n          <select className=\"nodrag\" value={data.type}>\n            <option value=\"sine\">sine</option>\n            <option value=\"triangle\">triangle</option>\n            <option value=\"sawtooth\">sawtooth</option>\n            <option value=\"square\">square</option>\n          </select>\n      </div>\n \n      <Handle type=\"source\" position=\"bottom\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\n“nodrag” is important.\n\nPay attention to the \"nodrag\" class being added to both the <input /> and <select /> elements. It’s super important that you remember to add this class otherwise you’ll find that React Flow intercepts the mouse events and you’ll be stuck dragging the node around forever!\n\nIf we try rendering this custom node we’ll find that the inputs don’t do anything. That’s because the input values are fixed by data.frequency and data.type but we have no event handlers listening to changes and no mechanism to update a node’s data!\n\nTo fix the situation we need to jump back to our store and add an updateNode action:\n\n./src/store.js\nexport const useStore = createWithEqualityFn((set, get) => ({\n  ...\n \n  updateNode(id, data) {\n    set({\n      nodes: get().nodes.map(node =>\n        node.id === id\n          ? { ...node, data: { ...node.data, ...data } }\n          : node\n      )\n    });\n  },\n \n  ...\n}));\n\nThis action will handle partial data updates, such that if we only want to update a node’s frequency, for example, we could just call updateNode(id, { frequency: 220 }. Now we just need to bring the action into our <Osc /> component and call it whenever an input changes.\n\n./src/nodes/Osc.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Handle } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow';\n \nimport { useStore } from '../store';\n \nconst selector = (id) => (store) => ({\n  setFrequency: (e) => store.updateNode(id, { frequency: +e.target.value }),\n  setType: (e) => store.updateNode(id, { type: e.target.value }),\n});\n \nexport default function Osc({ id, data }) {\n  const { setFrequency, setType } = useStore(selector(id), shallow);\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <p>Oscillator Node</p>\n \n        <label>\n          <span>Frequency:</span>\n          <input\n            className=\"nodrag\"\n            type=\"range\"\n            min=\"10\"\n            max=\"1000\"\n            value={data.frequency}\n            onChange={setFrequency}\n          />\n          <span>{data.frequency}Hz</span>\n        </label>\n \n        <label>\n          <span>Waveform:</span>\n          <select className=\"nodrag\" value={data.type} onChange={setType}>\n            <option value=\"sine\">sine</option>\n            <option value=\"triangle\">triangle</option>\n            <option value=\"sawtooth\">sawtooth</option>\n            <option value=\"square\">square</option>\n          </select>\n        </label>\n      </div>\n \n      <Handle type=\"source\" position=\"bottom\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nHey, that selector is back! Notice how this time we’re using it to derive two event handlers, setFrequency and setType, from the general updateNode action.\n\nThe last piece of the puzzle is to tell React Flow how to render our custom node. For that we need to create a nodeTypes object: the keys should correspond to a node’s type and the value will be the React component to render.\n\n./src/App.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow';\n \nimport { useStore } from './store';\nimport Osc from './nodes/Osc';\n \nconst selector = (store) => ({\n  nodes: store.nodes,\n  edges: store.edges,\n  onNodesChange: store.onNodesChange,\n  onEdgesChange: store.onEdgesChange,\n  addEdge: store.addEdge,\n});\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  osc: Osc,\n};\n \nexport default function App() {\n  const store = useStore(selector, shallow);\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={store.nodes}\n      nodeTypes={nodeTypes}\n      edges={store.edges}\n      onNodesChange={store.onNodesChange}\n      onEdgesChange={store.onEdgesChange}\n      onConnect={store.addEdge}\n    >\n      <Background />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n\nAvoid unnecessary renders.\n\nIt’s important to define nodeTypes outside of the <App /> component (or use React’s useMemo) to avoid recomputing it every render.\n\nIf you’ve got the dev server running, don’t panic if things haven’t changed yet! None of our temporary nodes have been given the right type yet, so React Flow just falls back to rendering the default node. If we change one of those nodes to be an osc with some initial values for frequency and type we should see our custom node being rendered.\n\nconst useStore = createWithEqualityFn((set, get) => ({\n  nodes: [\n    { type: 'osc',\n      id: 'a',\n      data: { frequency: 220, type: 'square' },\n      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  ...\n}));\n\nStuck on styling?\n\nIf you’re just implementing the code from this post as you go along, you’ll see that your custom node doesn’t look like the one in the preview above. To keep things easy to digest, we’ve left out styling in the code snippets.\n\nTo learn how to style your custom nodes, check out our docs on theming or our example using Tailwind.\n\nImplementing a gain node is pretty much the same process, so we’ll leave that one to you. Instead, we’ll turn our attention to the output node. This node will have no parameters control, but we do want to toggle signal processing on and off. That’s a bit difficult right now when we haven’t implemented any audio code yet, so in the meantime we’ll add just a flag to our store and an action to toggle it.\n\n./src/store.js\nconst useStore = createWithEqualityFn((set, get) => ({\n  ...\n \n  isRunning: false,\n \n  toggleAudio() {\n    set({ isRunning: !get().isRunning });\n  },\n \n  ...\n}));\n\nThe custom node itself is then pretty simple:\n\n./src/nodes/Out.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Handle } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow';\nimport { useStore } from '../store';\n \nconst selector = (store) => ({\n  isRunning: store.isRunning,\n  toggleAudio: store.toggleAudio,\n});\n \nexport default function Out({ id, data }) {\n  const { isRunning, toggleAudio } = useStore(selector, shallow);\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Handle type=\"target\" position=\"top\" />\n \n      <div>\n        <p>Output Node</p>\n \n        <button onClick={toggleAudio}>\n          {isRunning ? (\n            <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"mute\">\n              🔇\n            </span>\n          ) : (\n            <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"unmute\">\n              🔈\n            </span>\n          )}\n        </button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nThings are starting to shape up quite nicely!\n\nThe next step, then, is to…\n\nDo sound to it\n\nWe have an interactive graph and we’re able to update node data, now let’s add in what we know about the Web Audio API. Start by creating a new file, audio.js, and create a new audio context and an empty Map.\n\n./src/audio.js\nconst context = new AudioContext();\nconst nodes = new Map();\n\nThe way we’ll manage our audio graph is by hooking into the different actions in our store. So we might connect two audio nodes when the addEdge action is called, or update an audio node’s properties when updateNode is called, and so on.\n\nHardcoded nodes\n\nWe hardcoded a couple of nodes in our store earlier on in this post but our audio graph doesn’t know anything about them! For the finished project we can do away with all these hardcoded bits, but for now it’s really important that we also hardcode some audio nodes.\n\nHere’s how we did it:\n\n./src/audio.js\nconst context = new AudioContext();\nconst nodes = new Map();\n \nconst osc = context.createOscillator();\nosc.frequency.value = 220;\nosc.type = 'square';\nosc.start();\n \nconst amp = context.createGain();\namp.gain.value = 0.5;\n \nconst out = context.destination;\n \nnodes.set('a', osc);\nnodes.set('b', amp);\nnodes.set('c', out);\n1. Node changes\n\nRight now, there are two types of node changes that can happen in our graph and that we need to respond to: updating a node’s data, and removing a node from the graph. We already have an action for the former, so let’s handle that first.\n\nIn audio.js we’ll define a function, updateAudioNode, that we’ll call with a node’s id and a partial data object and use it to update an existing node in the Map:\n\n./src/audio.js\nexport function updateAudioNode(id, data) {\n  const node = nodes.get(id);\n \n  for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(data)) {\n    if (node[key] instanceof AudioParam) {\n      node[key].value = val;\n    } else {\n      node[key] = val;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nRemember that properties on an audio node may be special AudioParams that must be updated differently to regular object properties.\n\nNow we’ll want to update our updateNode action in the store to call this function as part of the update:\n\n./src/store.js\nimport { updateAudioNode } from './audio';\n \nexport const useStore = createWithEqualityFn((set, get) => ({\n  ...\n \n  updateNode(id, data) {\n    updateAudioNode(id, data);\n    set({ nodes: ... });\n  },\n \n  ...\n}));\n \n\nThe next change we need to handle is removing a node from the graph. If you select a node in the graph and hit backspace, React Flow will remove it. This is implicitly handled for us by the onNodesChange action we hooked up, but now we want some additional handling we’ll need to wire up a new action to React Flow’s onNodesDelete event.\n\nThis is actually pretty simple, so I’ll save you some reading and present the next three snippets of code without comment.\n\n./src/audio.js\n./src/store.js\n./src/App.jsx\nexport function removeAudioNode(id) {\n  const node = nodes.get(id);\n \n  node.disconnect();\n  node.stop?.();\n \n  nodes.delete(id);\n}\n\nThe only thing to note is that onNodesDelete calls the provided callback with an array of deleted nodes, because it is possible to delete more than one node at once!\n\n2. Edge changes\n\nWe’re getting super close to actually making some sounds! All that’s left is to handle changes to our graph’s edges. Like with node changes, we already have an action to handle creating new edges and we’re also implicitly handling removed edges in onEdgesChange.\n\nTo handle new connections, we just need the source and target ids from the edge created in our addEdge action. Then we can just look up the two nodes in our Map and connect them up.\n\n./src/audio.js\n./src/store.js\nexport function connect(sourceId, targetId) {\n  const source = nodes.get(sourceId);\n  const target = nodes.get(targetId);\n \n  source.connect(target);\n}\n\nWe saw React Flow accepted an onNodesDelete handler and wouldn’t you know it, there’s an onEdgesDelete handler too! The approach we’d take to implement disconnect and hook it up to our store and React Flow instance is pretty much the same as before, so we’ll leave that one down to you as well!\n\n3. Switching the speakers on\n\nYou’ll remember that our AudioContext probably begins in a suspended state to prevent potentially annoying autoplay issues. We already faked the data and actions we need for our <Out /> component in the store, now we just need to replace them with the real context’s state and resume/suspend methods.\n\n./src/audio.js\nexport function isRunning() {\n  return context.state === 'running';\n}\n \nexport function toggleAudio() {\n  return isRunning() ? context.suspend() : context.resume();\n}\n\nAlthough we haven’t been returning anything from our audio functions up until now, we need to return from toggleAudio because those methods are asynchronous and we don’t want to update the store prematurely!\n\n./src/store.js\nimport { ..., isRunning, toggleAudio } from './audio'\n \nexport const useStore = createWithEqualityFn((set, get) => ({\n  ...\n \n  isRunning: isRunning(),\n \n  toggleAudio() {\n    toggleAudio().then(() => {\n      set({ isRunning: isRunning() });\n    });\n  }\n}));\n\nEt voilà, we did it! We’ve now put enough together to actually make sounds! Let’s see what we have in action.\n\n4. Creating new nodes\n\nUp until now we have been dealing with a hard-coded set of nodes in our graph. This has been fine for prototyping but for it to actually be useful we’ll want a way to add new nodes to the graph dynamically. Our final task will be adding this functionality: we’ll work backwards starting with the audio code and ending by creating a basic toolbar.\n\nImplementing a createAudioNode function will be simple enough. All we need is an id for the new node, the type of node to create, and its initial data:\n\n./src/audio.js\nexport function createAudioNode(id, type, data) {\n  switch (type) {\n    case 'osc': {\n      const node = context.createOscillator();\n      node.frequency.value = data.frequency;\n      node.type = data.type;\n      node.start();\n \n      nodes.set(id, node);\n      break;\n    }\n \n    case 'amp': {\n      const node = context.createGain();\n      node.gain.value = data.gain;\n \n      nodes.set(id, node);\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNext we’ll need a createNode function in our store. The node id will be generated by nanoid and we’ll hardcode some initial data for each of the node types, so the only thing we need to pass in is the type of node to create:\n\n./src/store.js\nimport { ..., createAudioNode } from './audio';\n \nexport const useStore = createWithEqualityFn((set, get) => ({\n  ...\n \n  createNode(type) {\n    const id = nanoid();\n \n    switch(type) {\n      case 'osc': {\n        const data = { frequency: 440, type: 'sine' };\n        const position = { x: 0, y: 0 };\n \n        createAudioNode(id, type, data);\n        set({ nodes: [...get().nodes, { id, type, data, position }] });\n \n        break;\n      }\n \n      case 'amp': {\n        const data = { gain: 0.5 };\n        const position = { x: 0, y: 0 };\n \n        createAudioNode(id, type, data);\n        set({ nodes: [...get().nodes, { id, type, data, position }] });\n \n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}));\n\nWe could be a bit smarter about calculating the position of the new node, but to keep things simple we’ll just hardcode it to { x: 0, y: 0 } for now.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to create a toolbar component that can trigger the new createNode action. To do that we’ll jump back to App.jsx and make use of the <Panel /> built-in component.\n\n./src/App.jsx\n...\nimport { ReactFlow,  Panel } from '@xyflow/react';\n...\n \nconst selector = (store) => ({\n  ...,\n  createNode: store.createNode,\n});\n \nexport default function App() {\n  const store = useStore(selector, shallow);\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow>\n      <Panel position=\"top-right\">\n        ...\n      </Panel>\n      <Background />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n};\n\nWe don’t need anything fancy here, just a couple of buttons that trigger the createNode action with the appropriate type:\n\n./src/App.jsx\n<Panel position=\"top-right\">\n  <button onClick={() => store.createNode('osc')}>osc</button>\n  <button onClick={() => store.createNode('amp')}>amp</button>\n</Panel>\n\nAnd that’s… everything! We’ve now got a fully functional audio graph editor that can:\n\nCreate new audio nodes\nUpdate node data with some UI controls\nConnect nodes together\nDelete nodes and connections\nStart and stop audio processing\n\nHere’s the demo from the beginning, but this time you can see the source code to make sure you haven’t missed anything.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhew that was a long one, but we made it! For our efforts we’ve come out the other side with a fun little interactive audio playground, learned a little bit about the Web Audio API along the way, and have a better idea of one approach to “running” a React Flow graph.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far and are thinking “Hayleigh, I’m never going to write a Web Audio app. Did I learn anything useful?” Then you’re in luck, because you did! You could take our approach to connecting to the Web Audio API and apply it to some other graph-based computation engine like behave-graph . In fact, some has done just that and created behave-flow !\n\nThere are still plenty of ways to expand on this project. If you’d like to keep working on it, here are some ideas:\n\nAdd more node types.\nAllow nodes to connect to AudioParams on other nodes.\nUse the AnalyserNode to visualize the output of a node or signal.\nAnything else you can think of!\n\nAnd if you’re looking for inspiration, there are quite a few projects out in the wild that are using node-based UIs for audio things. Some of my favorites are Max/MSP , Reaktor , and Pure Data . Max and Reaktor are closed-source commercial software, but you can still steal some ideas from them 🕵️.\n\nYou can use the completed source code  as a starting point, or you can just keep building on top of what we’ve made today.

To build this app, we’ll be using state management, custom nodes and edges, and more.\n\n🎬 It’s Demo Time!\n\nBefore we get our hands dirty, I want to show you the mind-mapping tool we’ll have by the end of this tutorial:\n\nIf you’d like to live dangerously and dive right into the code, you can find the source code on Github .\n\n👩🏻‍💻 Getting started\n\nTo do this tutorial you will need some knowledge of React  and React Flow (hi, that’s us! 😁 it’s an open source library for building node-based UIs like workflow tools, ETL pipelines, and more.)\n\nWe’ll be using Vite  to develop our app, but you can also use Create React App  or any other tool you like. To scaffold a new React app with Vite you need to do:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nnpm create vite@latest reactflow-mind-map -- --template react\n# couldn't auto-convert command\n\nif you would like to use Typescript:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nnpm create vite@latest reactflow-mind-map -- --template react-ts\n# couldn't auto-convert command\n\nAfter the initial setup, you need to install some packages:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add reactflow zustand classcat nanoid\n\nWe are using Zustand  for managing the state of our application. It’s a bit like Redux but way smaller and there’s less boilerplate code to write. React Flow also uses Zustand, so the installation comes with no additional cost. (For this tutorial we are using Typescript but you can also use plain Javascript.)\n\nTo keep it simple we are putting all of our code in the src/App folder. For this you need to create the src/App folder and add an index file with the following content:\n\nsrc/App/index.tsx\nimport { ReactFlow, Controls, Panel } from '@xyflow/react';\n \n// we have to import the React Flow styles for it to work\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nfunction Flow() {\n  return (\n    <ReactFlow>\n      <Controls showInteractive={false} />\n      <Panel position=\"top-left\">React Flow Mind Map</Panel>\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default Flow;\n\nThis will be our main component for rendering the mind map. There are no nodes or edges yet, but we added the React Flow Controls component and a Panel to display the title of our app.\n\nTo be able to use React Flow hooks, we need to wrap the application with the ReactFlowProvider component in our main.tsx (entry file for vite). We are also importing the newly created App/index.tsx and render it inside the ReactFlowProvider. Your main file should look like this:\n\nsrc/main.tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';\nimport { ReactFlowProvider } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport App from './App';\n \nimport './index.css';\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <ReactFlowProvider>\n      <App />\n    </ReactFlowProvider>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n);\n\nThe parent container of the React Flow component needs a width and a height to work properly. Our app is a fullscreen app, so we add these rules to the index.css file:\n\nsrc/index.css\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n \nhtml,\nbody,\n#root {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\nWe are adding all styles of our app to the index.css file (you could also use Tailwind). Now you can start the development server with npm run dev and you should see the following:\n\n🏪 A store for nodes and edges\n\nAs mentioned above, we are using Zustand for state management. For this, we create a new file in our src/App folder called store.ts:\n\nsrc/App/store.ts\nimport {\n  Edge,\n  EdgeChange,\n  Node,\n  NodeChange,\n  OnNodesChange,\n  OnEdgesChange,\n  applyNodeChanges,\n  applyEdgeChanges,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { createWithEqualityFn } from 'zustand/traditional';\n \nexport type RFState = {\n  nodes: Node[];\n  edges: Edge[];\n  onNodesChange: OnNodesChange;\n  onEdgesChange: OnEdgesChange;\n};\n \nconst useStore = createWithEqualityFn<RFState>((set, get) => ({\n  nodes: [\n    {\n      id: 'root',\n      type: 'mindmap',\n      data: { label: 'React Flow Mind Map' },\n      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    },\n  ],\n  edges: [],\n  onNodesChange: (changes: NodeChange[]) => {\n    set({\n      nodes: applyNodeChanges(changes, get().nodes),\n    });\n  },\n  onEdgesChange: (changes: EdgeChange[]) => {\n    set({\n      edges: applyEdgeChanges(changes, get().edges),\n    });\n  },\n}));\n \nexport default useStore;\n\nIt seems like a lot of code, but it’s mostly types 😇 The store keeps track of the nodes and edges and handles the change events. When a user drags a node, React Flow fires a change event, the store then applies the changes and the updated nodes get rendered. (You can read more about this in our state management library guide.)\n\nAs you can see we start with one initial node placed at { x: 0, y: 0 } of type ‘mindmap’. To connect the store with our app, we use the useStore hook:\n\nsrc/App/index.tsx\nimport { ReactFlow, Controls, Panel, NodeOrigin } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow';\n \nimport useStore, { RFState } from './store';\n \n// we have to import the React Flow styles for it to work\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nconst selector = (state: RFState) => ({\n  nodes: state.nodes,\n  edges: state.edges,\n  onNodesChange: state.onNodesChange,\n  onEdgesChange: state.onEdgesChange,\n});\n \n// this places the node origin in the center of a node\nconst nodeOrigin: NodeOrigin = [0.5, 0.5];\n \nfunction Flow() {\n  // whenever you use multiple values, you should use shallow to make sure the component only re-renders when one of the values changes\n  const { nodes, edges, onNodesChange, onEdgesChange } = useStore(selector, shallow);\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={nodes}\n      edges={edges}\n      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n      nodeOrigin={nodeOrigin}\n      fitView\n    >\n      <Controls showInteractive={false} />\n      <Panel position=\"top-left\">React Flow Mind Map</Panel>\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default Flow;\n\nWe access the nodes, edges and change handlers from the store and pass them to the React Flow component. We also use the fitView prop to make sure that the initial node is centered in the view and set the node origin to [0.5, 0.5] to set the origin to the center of a node. After this, your app should look like this:\n\nYou can move the node around and zoom in and out, we are getting somewhere 🚀 Now let’s add some more functionality.\n\n✨ Custom nodes and edges\n\nWe want to use a custom type called ‘mindmap’ for our nodes. We need to add a new component for this. Let’s create a new folder called MindMapNode with an index file under src/App with the following content:\n\nsrc/App/MindMapNode/index.tsx\nimport { Handle, NodeProps, Position } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport type NodeData = {\n  label: string;\n};\n \nfunction MindMapNode({ id, data }: NodeProps<NodeData>) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input defaultValue={data.label} />\n \n      <Handle type=\"target\" position={Position.Top} />\n      <Handle type=\"source\" position={Position.Bottom} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default MindMapNode;\n\nWe are using an input for displaying and editing the labels of our mind map nodes, and two handles for connecting them. This is necessary for React Flow to work; the handles are used as the start and end position of the edges.\n\nWe also add some CSS to the index.css file to make the nodes look a bit prettier:\n\nsrc/index.css\n.react-flow__node-mindmap {\n  background: white;\n  border-radius: 2px;\n  border: 1px solid transparent;\n  padding: 2px 5px;\n  font-weight: 700;\n}\n\n(For more on this, you can read the guide to custom nodes in our docs.)\n\nLet’s do the same for the custom edge. Create a new folder called MindMapEdge with an index file under src/App:\n\nsrc/App/MindMapEdge/index.tsx\nimport { BaseEdge, EdgeProps, getStraightPath } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nfunction MindMapEdge(props: EdgeProps) {\n  const { sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY } = props;\n \n  const [edgePath] = getStraightPath({\n    sourceX,\n    sourceY,\n    targetX,\n    targetY,\n  });\n \n  return <BaseEdge path={edgePath} {...props} />;\n}\n \nexport default MindMapEdge;\n\nI will get into more detail about the custom nodes and edges in the next section. For now it’s important that we can use the new types in our app, by adding the following to our Flow component:\n\nimport MindMapNode from './MindMapNode';\nimport MindMapEdge from './MindMapEdge';\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  mindmap: MindMapNode,\n};\n \nconst edgeTypes = {\n  mindmap: MindMapEdge,\n};\n\nand then pass the newly created types to the React Flow component.\n\nNice! We can already change the labels of our nodes by clicking in the input field and typing something.\n\n🆕 New nodes\n\nWe want to make it super quick for a user to create a new node. The user should be able to add a new node by clicking on a node and drag to the position where a new node should be placed. This functionality is not built into React Flow, but we can implement it by using the onConnectStart and onConnectEnd handlers.\n\nWe are using the start handler to remember the node that was clicked and the end handler to create the new node:\n\nAdd to src/App/index.tsx\nconst connectingNodeId = useRef<string | null>(null);\n \nconst onConnectStart: OnConnectStart = useCallback((_, { nodeId }) => {\n  connectingNodeId.current = nodeId;\n}, []);\n \nconst onConnectEnd: OnConnectEnd = useCallback((event) => {\n  // we only want to create a new node if the connection ends on the pane\n  const targetIsPane = (event.target as Element).classList.contains('react-flow__pane');\n \n  if (targetIsPane && connectingNodeId.current) {\n    console.log(`add new node with parent node ${connectingNodeId.current}`);\n  }\n}, []);\n\nSince our nodes are managed by the store, we create an action to add a new node and its edge. This is how our addChildNode action looks:\n\nNew action in src/store.ts\naddChildNode: (parentNode: Node, position: XYPosition) => {\n  const newNode = {\n    id: nanoid(),\n    type: 'mindmap',\n    data: { label: 'New Node' },\n    position,\n    parentNode: parentNode.id,\n  };\n \n  const newEdge = {\n    id: nanoid(),\n    source: parentNode.id,\n    target: newNode.id,\n  };\n \n  set({\n    nodes: [...get().nodes, newNode],\n    edges: [...get().edges, newEdge],\n  });\n};\n\nWe are using the passed node as a parent. Normally this feature is used to implement grouping or sub flows. Here we are using it to move all child nodes when their parent is moved. It enables us to clean up and re-order the mind map so that we don’t have to move all child nodes manually. Let’s use the new action in our onConnectEnd handler:\n\nAdjustments in src/App/index.tsx\nconst store = useStoreApi();\n \nconst onConnectEnd: OnConnectEnd = useCallback(\n  (event) => {\n    const { nodeLookup } = store.getState();\n    const targetIsPane = (event.target as Element).classList.contains('react-flow__pane');\n \n    if (targetIsPane && connectingNodeId.current) {\n      const parentNode = nodeLookup.get(connectingNodeId.current);\n      const childNodePosition = getChildNodePosition(event, parentNode);\n \n      if (parentNode && childNodePosition) {\n        addChildNode(parentNode, childNodePosition);\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  [getChildNodePosition],\n);\n\nFirst we are getting the nodeLookup from the React Flow store via store.getState(). nodeLookup is a map that contains all nodes and their current state. We need it to get the position and dimensions of the clicked node. Then we check if the target of the onConnectEnd event is the React Flow pane. If it is, we want to add a new node. For this we are using our addChildNode and the newly created getChildNodePosition helper function.\n\nHelper function in src/App/index.tsx\nconst getChildNodePosition = (event: MouseEvent, parentNode?: Node) => {\n  const { domNode } = store.getState();\n \n  if (\n    !domNode ||\n    // we need to check if these properties exist, because when a node is not initialized yet,\n    // it doesn't have a positionAbsolute nor a width or height\n    !parentNode?.computed?.positionAbsolute ||\n    !parentNode?.computed?.width ||\n    !parentNode?.computed?.height\n  ) {\n    return;\n  }\n \n  const panePosition = screenToFlowPosition({\n    x: event.clientX,\n    y: event.clientY,\n  });\n \n  // we are calculating with positionAbsolute here because child nodes are positioned relative to their parent\n  return {\n    x:\n      panePosition.x -\n      parentNode.computed?.positionAbsolute.x +\n      parentNode.computed?.width / 2,\n    y:\n      panePosition.y -\n      parentNode.computed?.positionAbsolute.y +\n      parentNode.computed?.height / 2,\n  };\n};\n\nThis function returns the position of the new node we want to add to our store. We are using the project function to convert screen coordinates into React Flow coordinates. As mentioned earlier, child nodes are positioned relative to their parents. That’s why we need to subtract the parent position from the child node position. That was a lot to take in, let’s see it in action:\n\nTo test the new functionality you can start a connection from a handle and then end it on the pane. You should see a new node being added to the mind map.\n\n🤝 Keep data in sync\n\nWe can already update the labels but we are not updating the nodes data object. This is important to keep our app in sync and if we want to save our nodes on the server for example. To achieve this we add a new action called updateNodeLabel to the store. This action takes a node id and a label. The implementation is pretty straight forward: we iterate over the existing nodes and update the matching one with the passed label:\n\nsrc/store.ts\nupdateNodeLabel: (nodeId: string, label: string) => {\n  set({\n    nodes: get().nodes.map((node) => {\n      if (node.id === nodeId) {\n        // it's important to create a new object here, to inform React Flow about the changes\n        node.data = { ...node.data, label };\n      }\n \n      return node;\n    }),\n  });\n},\n\nLet’s use the new action in our MindmapNode component:\n\nsrc/App/MindmapNode/index.tsx\nimport { Handle, NodeProps, Position } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport useStore from '../store';\n \nexport type NodeData = {\n  label: string;\n};\n \nfunction MindMapNode({ id, data }: NodeProps<NodeData>) {\n  const updateNodeLabel = useStore((state) => state.updateNodeLabel);\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        // from now on we can use value instead of defaultValue\n        // this makes sure that the input always shows the current label of the node\n        value={data.label}\n        onChange={(evt) => updateNodeLabel(id, evt.target.value)}\n        className=\"input\"\n      />\n \n      <Handle type=\"target\" position={Position.Top} />\n      <Handle type=\"source\" position={Position.Top} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default MindMapNode;\n\nThat was quick! The input fields of the custom nodes now display the current label of the nodes. You could take your nodes data, save it on the server and then load it again.\n\n💅 Simpler UX and nicer styling\n\nFunctionality-wise we are finished with our mind map app! We can add new nodes, update their labels and move them around. But the UX and styling could use some improvements. Let’s make it easier to drag the nodes and to create new nodes!\n\n1. A node as handle\n\nLet’s use the whole node as a handle, rather than displaying the default handles. This makes it easier to create nodes, because the area where you can start a new connection gets bigger. We need to style the source handle to be the size of the node and hide the target handle visually. React Flow still needs it to connect the nodes but we don’t need to display it since we are creating new nodes by dropping an edge on the pane. We use plain old CSS to hide the target handle and position it in the center of the node:\n\nsrc/index.css\n.react-flow__handle.target {\n  top: 50%;\n  pointer-events: none;\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n\nIn order to make the whole node a handle, we also update the style of the source:\n\nsrc/index.css\n.react-flow__handle.source {\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  transform: none;\n  background: #f6ad55;\n  height: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  border-radius: 2px;\n  border: none;\n}\n\nThis works but we can’t move the nodes anymore because the source handle is now the whole node and covers the input field. We fix that by using the dragHandle node option. It allows us to specify a selector for a DOM element that should be used as a drag handle. For this we adjust the custom node a bit:\n\nsrc/App/MindmapNode/index.tsx\nimport { Handle, NodeProps, Position } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport useStore from '../store';\n \nexport type NodeData = {\n  label: string;\n};\n \nfunction MindMapNode({ id, data }: NodeProps<NodeData>) {\n  const updateNodeLabel = useStore((state) => state.updateNodeLabel);\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"inputWrapper\">\n        <div className=\"dragHandle\">\n          {/* icon taken from grommet https://icons.grommet.io */}\n          <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n            <path\n              fill=\"#333\"\n              stroke=\"#333\"\n              strokeWidth=\"1\"\n              d=\"M15 5h2V3h-2v2zM7 5h2V3H7v2zm8 8h2v-2h-2v2zm-8 0h2v-2H7v2zm8 8h2v-2h-2v2zm-8 0h2v-2H7v2z\"\n            />\n          </svg>\n        </div>\n        <input\n          value={data.label}\n          onChange={(evt) => updateNodeLabel(id, evt.target.value)}\n          className=\"input\"\n        />\n      </div>\n \n      <Handle type=\"target\" position={Position.Top} />\n      <Handle type=\"source\" position={Position.Top} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default MindMapNode;\n\nWe add a wrapper div with the class name inputWrapper and a div with the class name dragHandle that acts as the drag handle (surprise!). Now we can style the new elements:\n\nsrc/index.css\n.inputWrapper {\n  display: flex;\n  height: 20px;\n  z-index: 1;\n  position: relative;\n}\n \n.dragHandle {\n  background: transparent;\n  width: 14px;\n  height: 100%;\n  margin-right: 4px;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n \n.input {\n  border: none;\n  padding: 0 2px;\n  border-radius: 1px;\n  font-weight: 700;\n  background: transparent;\n  height: 100%;\n  color: #222;\n}\n2. Activate input on focus\n\nWe are almost there but we need to adjust some more details. We want to start our new connection from the center of the node. For this we set the pointer events of the input to “none” and check if the user releases the button on top of the node. Only then we want to activate the input field. We can use our onConnectEnd function to achieve this:\n\nsrc/App/index.tsx\nconst onConnectEnd: OnConnectEnd = useCallback(\n  (event) => {\n    const { nodeLookup } = store.getState();\n    const targetIsPane = (event.target as Element).classList.contains('react-flow__pane');\n    const node = (event.target as Element).closest('.react-flow__node');\n \n    if (node) {\n      node.querySelector('input')?.focus({ preventScroll: true });\n    } else if (targetIsPane && connectingNodeId.current) {\n      const parentNode = nodeLookup.get(connectingNodeId.current);\n      const childNodePosition = getChildNodePosition(event, parentNode);\n \n      if (parentNode && childNodePosition) {\n        addChildNode(parentNode, childNodePosition);\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  [getChildNodePosition],\n);\n\nAs you see we are focusing the input field if the user releases the mouse button on top of a node. We can now add some styling so that the input field is activated (pointerEvents: all) only when it’s focused:\n\n/* we want the connection line to be below the node */\n.react-flow .react-flow__connectionline {\n  z-index: 0;\n}\n \n/* pointer-events: none so that the click for the connection goes through */\n.inputWrapper {\n  display: flex;\n  height: 20px;\n  position: relative;\n  z-index: 1;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n \n/* pointer-events: all so that we can use the drag handle (here the user cant start a new connection) */\n.dragHandle {\n  background: transparent;\n  width: 14px;\n  height: 100%;\n  margin-right: 4px;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  pointer-events: all;\n}\n \n/* pointer-events: none by default */\n.input {\n  border: none;\n  padding: 0 2px;\n  border-radius: 1px;\n  font-weight: 700;\n  background: transparent;\n  height: 100%;\n  color: #222;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n \n/* pointer-events: all when it's focused so that we can type in it */\n.input:focus {\n  border: none;\n  outline: none;\n  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25);\n  pointer-events: all;\n}\n3. Dynamic width and auto focus\n\nAlmost done! We want to have a dynamic width for the nodes based on the length of the text. To keep it simple we do a calculation based on the length of text for this:\n\nAdded effect in src/app/MindMapNode.tsx\nuseLayoutEffect(() => {\n  if (inputRef.current) {\n    inputRef.current.style.width = `${data.label.length * 8}px`;\n  }\n}, [data.label.length]);\n\nWe also want to focus / activate a node right after it gets created:\n\nAdded effect in src/app/MindMapNode.tsx\nuseEffect(() => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    if (inputRef.current) {\n      inputRef.current.focus({ preventScroll: true });\n    }\n  }, 1);\n}, []);\n\nNow when you adjust a node label, the width of the node will adjust accordingly. You can also create a new node and it will be focused right away.\n\n4. Centered edges and styling details\n\nYou may have noticed that the edges are not centered. We created a custom edge at the beginning for this, and now we can adjust it a bit so that the edge starts in the center of the node and not at the top of the handle (the default behavior):\n\nsrc/App/MindMapEdge.tsx\nimport { BaseEdge, EdgeProps, getStraightPath } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nfunction MindMapEdge(props: EdgeProps) {\n  const { sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY } = props;\n \n  const [edgePath] = getStraightPath({\n    sourceX,\n    sourceY: sourceY + 20,\n    targetX,\n    targetY,\n  });\n \n  return <BaseEdge path={edgePath} {...props} />;\n}\n \nexport default MindMapEdge;\n\nWe are passing all props to the getStraightPath helper function but adjust the sourceY so that it is in the center of the node.\n\nMore over we want the title to be a bit more subtle and choose a color for our background. We can do this by adjusting the color of the panel (we added the class name \"header\") and the background color of the body element:\n\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  background-color: #f8f8f8;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n \n.header {\n  color: #cdcdcd;\n}\n\nNicely done! 💯 You can find the final code here:\n\n👋 Final thoughts\n\nWhat a trip! We started with an empty pane and ended with a fully functional mind map app. If you want to move on you could work on some of the following features:\n\nAdd new nodes by clicking on the pane\nSave and restore button to store current state to local storage\nExport and import UI\nCollaborative editing\n\nI hope you enjoyed this tutorial and learned something new!

We are also adding common questions and pitfalls that we collect from our Discord Server , Github Issues  and Github Discussions .\n\nWarning: Seems like you have not used zustand provider as an ancestor.\n\nThis usually happens when:\n\nA: You have two different versions of @reactflow/core installed.\nB: You are trying to access the internal React Flow state outside of the React Flow context.\n\nSolution for A\n\nUpdate reactflow and @reactflow/node-resizer (in case you are using it), remove node_modules and package-lock.json and reinstall the dependencies.\n\nSolution for B\n\nA possible solution is to wrap your component with a <ReactFlowProvider /> or move the code that is accessing the state inside a child of your React Flow instance.\n\nThis will cause an error:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nfunction FlowWithoutProvider(props) {\n  // cannot access the state here\n  const reactFlowInstance = useReactFlow();\n \n  return <ReactFlow {...props} />;\n}\n \nexport default FlowWithoutProvider;\nThis will cause an error, too:\nimport { ReactFlow, ReactFlowProvider } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  // still cannot access the state here\n  // only child components of this component can access the state\n  const reactFlowInstance = useReactFlow();\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlowProvider>\n      <ReactFlow {...props} />\n    </ReactFlowProvider>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default FlowWithProvider;\nThis works:\n\nAs soon as you want to access the internal state of React Flow (for example by using the useReactFlow hook), you need to wrap your component with a <ReactFlowProvider />. Here the wrapping is done outside of the component:\n\nimport { ReactFlow, ReactFlowProvider } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  // you can access the internal state here\n  const reactFlowInstance = useReactFlow();\n \n  return <ReactFlow {...props} />;\n}\n \n// wrapping with ReactFlowProvider is done outside of the component\nfunction FlowWithProvider(props) {\n  return (\n    <ReactFlowProvider>\n      <Flow {...props} />\n    </ReactFlowProvider>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default FlowWithProvider;\nIt looks like you have created a new nodeTypes or edgeTypes object.\n\nIf this wasn’t on purpose please define the nodeTypes/edgeTypes outside of the component or memoize them.\n\nThis warning appears when the nodeTypes or edgeTypes properties change after the initial render. The nodeTypes or edgeTypes should only be changed dynamically in very rare cases. Usually, they are defined once, along with all the types you use in your application. It can happen easily that you are defining the nodeTypes or edgeTypes object inside of your component render function, which will cause React Flow to re-render every time your component re-renders.\n\nCauses a warning:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport MyCustomNode from './MyCustomNode';\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  // new object being created on every render\n  // causing unnecessary re-renders\n  const nodeTypes = {\n    myCustomNode: MyCustomNode,\n  };\n \n  return <ReactFlow nodeTypes={nodeTypes} />;\n}\n \nexport default Flow;\nRecommended implementation:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport MyCustomNode from './MyCustomNode';\n \n// defined outside of the component\nconst nodeTypes = {\n  myCustomNode: MyCustomNode,\n};\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  return <ReactFlow nodeTypes={nodeTypes} />;\n}\n \nexport default Flow;\nAlternative implementation:\n\nYou can use this if you want to change your nodeTypes dynamically without causing unnecessary re-renders.\n\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport MyCustomNode from './MyCustomNode';\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  const nodeTypes = useMemo(\n    () => ({\n      myCustomNode: MyCustomNode,\n    }),\n    [],\n  );\n \n  return <ReactFlow nodeTypes={nodeTypes} />;\n}\n \nexport default Flow;\nNode type not found. Using fallback type “default”.\n\nThis usually happens when you specify a custom node type for one of your nodes but do not pass the correct nodeTypes property to React Flow. The string for the type option of your custom node needs to be exactly the same as the key of the nodeTypes object.\n\nDoesn’t work:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport MyCustomNode from './MyCustomNode';\n \nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'mycustomnode',\n    type: 'custom',\n    // ...\n  },\n];\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  // nodeTypes property is missing, so React Flow cannot find the custom node component to render\n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} />;\n}\nDoesn’t work either:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport MyCustomNode from './MyCustomNode';\n \nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'mycustomnode',\n    type: 'custom',\n    // ...\n  },\n];\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  Custom: MyCustomNode,\n};\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  // node.type and key in nodeTypes object are not exactly the same (capitalized)\n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} nodeTypes={nodeTypes} />;\n}\nThis does work:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport MyCustomNode from './MyCustomNode';\n \nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'mycustomnode',\n    type: 'custom',\n    // ...\n  },\n];\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  custom: MyCustomNode,\n};\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} nodeTypes={nodeTypes} />;\n}\nThe React Flow parent container needs a width and a height to render the graph.\n\nUnder the hood, React Flow measures the parent DOM element to adjust the renderer. If you try to render React Flow in a regular div without a height, we cannot display the graph. If you encounter this warning, you need to make sure that your wrapper component has some CSS attached to it so that it gets a fixed height or inherits the height of its parent.\n\nThis will cause the warning:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ReactFlow {...props} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nWorking example:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ height: 800 }}>\n      <ReactFlow {...props} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nOnly child nodes can use a parent extent.\n\nThis warning appears when you are trying to add the extent option to a node that does not have a parent node. Depending on what you are trying to do, you can remove the extent option or specify a parentNode.\n\nDoes show a warning:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'mycustomnode',\n    extent: 'parent',\n    // ...\n  },\n];\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} />;\n}\nWarning resolved:\nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: 'mycustomnode',\n    parentNode: 'someothernode',\n    extent: 'parent',\n    // ...\n  },\n];\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} />;\n}\nCan’t create edge. An edge needs a source and a target.\n\nThis happens when you do not pass a source and a target option to the edge object. Without the source and target, the edge cannot be rendered.\n\nWill show a warning:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nconst nodes = [\n  /* ... */\n];\n \nconst edges = [\n  {\n    nosource: '1',\n    notarget: '2',\n  },\n];\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={edges} />;\n}\nThis works:\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nconst nodes = [\n  /* ... */\n];\n \nconst edges = [\n  {\n    source: '1',\n    target: '2',\n  },\n];\n \nfunction Flow(props) {\n  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={edges} />;\n}\nThe old edge with id=“some-id” does not exist.\n\nThis can happen when you are trying to reconnect an edge but the edge you want to update is already removed from the state. This is a very rare case. Please see the Reconnect Edge example for implementation details.\n\nCouldn’t create edge for source/target handle id: “some-id”; edge id: “some-id”.\n\nThis can happen if you are working with multiple handles and a handle is not found by its id property or if you haven’t updated the node internals after adding or removing handles programmatically. Please see the Custom Node Example for an example of working with multiple handles.\n\nMarker type doesn’t exist.\n\nThis warning occurs when you are trying to specify a marker type that is not built into React Flow. The existing marker types are documented here.\n\nHandle: No node id found.\n\nThis warning occurs when you try to use a <Handle /> component outside of a custom node component.\n\nI get an error when building my app with webpack 4.\n\nIf you’re using webpack 4, you’ll likely run into an error like this:\n\nERROR in /node_modules/@reactflow/core/dist/esm/index.js 16:19\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token (16:19)\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders\n\nReact Flow is a modern JavaScript code base and makes use of lots of newer JavaScript features. By default, webpack 4 does not transpile your code and it doesn’t know how to handle React Flow.\n\nYou need to add a number of babel plugins to your webpack config to make it work:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add --save-dev babel-loader@8.2.5 @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining @babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator\n\nand configure the loader like this:\n\n{\n  test: /node_modules[\\/\\\\]@?reactflow[\\/\\\\].*.js$/,\n  use: {\n    loader: 'babel-loader',\n    options: {\n      presets: ['@babel/preset-env', \"@babel/preset-react\"],\n      plugins: [\n        \"@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining\",\n        \"@babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator\",\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIf you’re using webpack 5, you don’t need to do anything! React Flow will work out of the box.\n\nMouse events aren’t working consistently when my nodes contain a <canvas /> element.\n\nIf you’re using a <canvas /> element inside your custom node, you might run into problems with seemingly incorrect coordinates in mouse events from the canvas.\n\nReact Flow uses CSS transforms to scale nodes as you zoom in and out. However, from the DOM’s perspective, the element is still the same size. This can cause problems if you have event listeners that want to calculate the mouse position relative to the canvas element.\n\nTo remedy this in event handlers you control, you can scale your computed relative position by 1 / zoom where zoom is the current zoom level of the flow. To get the current zoom level, you can use the getZoom method from the useReactFlow hook.\n\nEdges are not displaying.\n\nIf your edges are not displaying in React Flow, this might be due to one of the following reasons:\n\nYou have not imported the React Flow stylesheet. If you haven’t imported it, you can import it like import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';.\nIf you have replaced your default nodes with a custom node, check if that custom node has appropriate source/target handles in the custom node component. An edge cannot be made without a handle.\nIf you use an external styling library like Tailwind or Bulma, ensure it doesn’t override the edge styles. For example, sometimes styling libraries override the .react-flow__edges SVG selector with overflow: hidden, which hides the edges.\nIf you are using an async operation like a request to the backend, make sure to call the updateNodeInternals function returned by the useUpdateNodeInternal hook after the async operation so React Flow updates the handle position internally.\nEdges are not displaying correctly.\n\nIf your edges are not rendering as they should, this could be due to one of the following reasons:\n\nIf you want to hide your handles, do not use display: none to hide them. Use either opacity: 0 or visibility: hidden.\nIf edges are not connected to the correct handle, check if you have added more than one handle of the same type(source or target) in your custom node component. If that is the case, assign IDs to them. Multiple handles of the same kind on a node need to have distinguishable IDs so that React Flow knows which handle an edge corresponds to.\nIf you are changing the position of the handles (via reordering, etc.), make sure to call the updateNodeInternals function returned by the useUpdateNodeInternals hook after so React Flow knows to update the handle position internally.\nIf you are using a custom edge and want your edge to go from the source handle to a target handle, make sure to correctly pass the sourceX, sourceY, targetX, and targetY props you get from the custom edge component in the edge path creation function(e.g., getBezierPath, etc.). sourceX, sourceY, and targetX, targetY represent the x,y coordinates for the source and target handle, respectively.\nIf the custom edge from the source or target side is not going towards the handle as expected (entering or exiting from a handle at a weird angle), make sure to pass the sourcePosition and targetPosition props you get from the custom edge component in the edge path creation function(e.g., getBezierPath). Passing the source/target handle position in the path creation function is necessary for the edge to start or end properly at a handle.\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nReact Flow UI\nRemove Attribution\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

We renamed it because it now includes both components and templates. Additionally, since it’s built on shadcn/ui, the “UI” naming makes it easier for developers to recognize the connection and understand what we offer.\n\nRecently, we launched an exciting new addition to our open-source roster: React Flow UI (Previously known as React Flow Components). These are pre-built nodes, edges, and other ui elements that you can quickly add to your React Flow applications to get up and running. The catch is these components are built on top of shadcn/ui  and the shadcn CLI.\n\nWe’ve previously written about our experience and what led us to choosing shadcn over on the xyflow blog , but in this tutorial we’re going to focus on how to get started from scratch with shadcn, Tailwind CSS, and React Flow Components.\n\nWait, what’s shadcn?\n\nNo what, who! Shadcn is the author of a collection of pre-designed components known as shadcn/ui. Notice how we didn’t say library there? Shadcn takes a different approach where components are added to your project’s source code and are “owned” by you: once you add a component you’re free to modify it to suit your needs!\n\nGetting started\n\nTo begin with, we will:\n\nSet up a new vite project.\nSet up shadcn/ui  along with Tailwind CSS .\nAdd and configure React Flow.\nCreate our custom React Flow components using the building blocks in our UI components registry.\nSetting up a new vite project\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nnpm create vite@latest\n# couldn't auto-convert command\n\nVite is able to scaffold projects for many popular frameworks, but we only care about React! Additionally, make sure to set up a TypeScript project. React Flow’s documentation is a mix of JavaScript and TypeScript, but for shadcn components TypeScript is required!\n\nDuring the interactive setup, select React and TypeScript:\n\n◇  Project name:\n│  my-react-flow-app\n│\n◇  Select a framework:\n│  React\n│\n◇  Select a variant:\n│  TypeScript\n│\n◇  Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)?:\n│  No\n│\n◇  Install with pnpm and start now?\n│  Yes\n│\n◇  Scaffolding project in /Users/alessandro/src/xyflow/wip/component-style-test-2...\n│\n◇  Installing dependencies with pnpm...\nSetting up Tailwind CSS\n\nAll shadcn and React Flow components are styled with Tailwind CSS , so we’ll need to install that and a few other dependencies next.\n\nWe can follow the instructions in the shadcn installation guide  to install shadcn and Tailwind CSS inside of a freshly scaffolded vite project.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\n\nIt is now a lot simpler to set up Tailwind CSS in a vite project, and Tailwind 4 is configured completely in CSS. You can just replace the generated src/index.css file with this one line:\n\nsrc/index.css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\nImporting Tailwind CSS as a Vite plugin\n\nStarting with Tailwind CSS v4 , you can use the dedicated Vite plugin @tailwindcss/vite rather than the traditional PostCSS plugin. This plugin is configured in our vite.config.ts file, and makes things a lot simpler, both for us developers, and for the compilers.\n\nWe simply need to import the plugin and add it to the plugins array in our vite.config.ts file. We also need to add the alias property to the resolve object to tell Vite where to find our source files, as shadcn components use the @ alias to refer to the src directory.\n\nvite.config.ts\nimport path from \"path\"\nimport tailwindcss from \"@tailwindcss/vite\"\nimport react from \"@vitejs/plugin-react\"\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\"\n \n// https://vite.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      \"@\": path.resolve(__dirname, \"./src\"),\n    },\n  },\n})\nImporting the Tailwind CSS file\n\nWe now need to make sure that the only CSS file in our project is the Tailwind CSS file. In the generated App.tsx, you can safely remove the import of the App.css file, and remove everything else that is in the scaffolded App.tsx file.\n\nTo verify that Tailwind CSS is working, we can add a simple div and h1 elements with Tailwind classes.\n\nThe updated App.tsx file should look like this:\n\nsrc/App.tsx\nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-screen h-screen p-8\">\n      <h1 className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Hello World</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nexport default App;\n\nAnd, the main.tsx file should look like this:\n\nsrc/main.tsx\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'\nimport './index.css'\nimport App from './App.tsx'\n \ncreateRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>,\n)\n\nIf you updated your index.css file and configured Vite to use the Tailwind CSS plugin, you should be able to run the project and see the “Hello World” message in your browser, in a nice, large, bold font.\n\nThe classes w-screen and h-screen are two examples of Tailwind’s utility classes. If you’re used to styling React apps using a different approach, you might find this a bit strange at first. You can think of Tailwind classes as supercharged inline styles: they’re constrained to a set design system and you have access to responsive media queries or pseudo-classes like hover and focus.\n\nSetting up shadcn/ui\n\nVite scaffolds some tsconfig files for us when generating a TypeScript project and we’ll need to make some changes to these so the shadcn components can work correctly. The shadcn CLI is pretty clever (we’ll get to that in a second) but it can’t account for every project structure so instead shadcn components that depend on one another make use of TypeScript’s import paths.\n\nThe current version of Vite splits TypeScript configuration into three files, two of which need to be edited. Add the baseUrl and paths properties to the compilerOptions section of the tsconfig.json and tsconfig.app.json files:\n\ntsconfig.json\n{\n  // ...\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\ntsconfig.app.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    // ...\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nNice! Now we’re ready to set up the shadcn/ui CLI and add our first components. Once the CLI is set up, we’ll be able to add new components to our project with a single command - even if they have dependencies or need to modify existing files!\n\nWe can now run the following command to set up shadcn/ui in our project:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n\nThe CLI will perform a few tasks, first it will identify your project’s framework, tailwind version, and then ask you what color you would like to use as the base color for your project. It will then update your index.css file and generate a components.json file in the root of your project, which will be shadcn’s main configuration points.\n\nWe can take all the default options for now\n\n√ Preflight checks.\n√ Verifying framework. Found Vite.\n√ Validating Tailwind CSS config. Found v4.\n√ Validating import alias.\n√ Which color would you like to use as the base color? › Neutral\n√ Writing components.json.\n√ Checking registry.\n√ Updating CSS variables in src/index.css\n√ Installing dependencies.\n√ Created 1 file:\n  - src/lib/utils.ts\nSuccess! Project initialization completed.\nYou may now add components.\nInstalling React Flow and importing its CSS.\n\nNow we can install React Flow and import its CSS.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm add @xyflow/react\n\nAnd then import its CSS in our App.tsx file:\n\nsrc/App.tsx\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-screen h-screen p-8\">\n      <h1 className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Hello World</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nexport default App;\nAdding your first components\n\nTo demonstrate how powerful shadcn can be, let’s dive right into making a new React Flow app! Now everything is set up, we can add the <BaseNode /> component with a single command:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/base-node\n\nThis command will generate a new file src/components/base-node.tsx, and install the necessary dependencies.\n\nThat <BaseNode /> component is not a React Flow node directly. Instead, as the name implies, it’s a base that many of our other nodes build upon. It also comes with additional components that you can use to provide a header and content for your nodes. These components are:\n\n<BaseNodeHeader />\n<BaseNodeHeaderTitle />\n<BaseNodeContent />\n<BaseNodeFooter />\n\nYou can use it to have a unified style for all of your nodes as well. Let’s see what it looks like by updating our App.tsx file:\n\nsrc/App.tsx\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport {\n  BaseNode,\n  BaseNodeContent,\n  BaseNodeHeader,\n  BaseNodeHeaderTitle,\n} from \"@/components/base-node\";\n \nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-screen h-screen p-8\">\n      <BaseNode>\n        <BaseNodeHeader>\n          <BaseNodeHeaderTitle>Base Node</BaseNodeHeaderTitle>\n        </BaseNodeHeader>\n        <BaseNodeContent>\n          This is a base node component that can be used to build other nodes.\n        </BaseNodeContent>\n      </BaseNode>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default App;\n\nOk, not super exciting…\n\nThe <BaseNode /> component is one of the most used components in our UI components registry. Some components may use it internally, to create custom nodes with a consistent style, while some other components can be used in combination with it to create more complex nodes.\n\nFor example, let’s add the <NodeTooltip /> component to our project, to display a tooltip when hovering over a node.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/node-tooltip\n\nAnd we’ll update our App.tsx file to render a proper flow. We’ll use the same basic setup as most of our examples so we won’t break down the individual pieces here. If you’re still new to React Flow and want to learn a bit more about how to set up a basic flow from scratch, check out our quickstart guide.\n\nsrc/App.tsx\nimport { Position, ReactFlow, useNodesState, type Node } from \"@xyflow/react\";\n \nimport \"@xyflow/react/dist/style.css\";\n \nimport { BaseNode, BaseNodeContent } from \"@/components/base-node\";\nimport {\n  NodeTooltip,\n  NodeTooltipContent,\n  NodeTooltipTrigger,\n} from \"@/components/node-tooltip\";\n \nfunction Tooltip() {\n  return (\n    <NodeTooltip>\n      <NodeTooltipContent position={Position.Top}>\n        Hidden Content\n      </NodeTooltipContent>\n      <BaseNode>\n        <BaseNodeContent>\n          <NodeTooltipTrigger>Hover</NodeTooltipTrigger>\n        </BaseNodeContent>\n      </BaseNode>\n    </NodeTooltip>\n  );\n}\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  tooltip: Tooltip,\n};\n \nconst initialNodes: Node[] = [\n  {\n    id: \"1\",\n    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    data: {},\n    type: \"tooltip\",\n  },\n];\n \nfunction Flow() {\n  const [nodes, , onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"h-screen w-screen p-8 bg-gray-50 rounded-xl\">\n      <ReactFlow\n        nodes={nodes}\n        nodeTypes={nodeTypes}\n        onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n        fitView\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <Flow />;\n}\n\nAnd would you look at that, the tooltip node we added automatically uses the <BaseNode /> component we customized!\n\nMoving fast and making things\n\nNow we’ve got a basic understanding of how shadcn/ui and the CLI works, we can begin to see how easy it is to add new components and build out a flow. To see everything React Flow Components has to offer let’s build out a simple calculator flow.\n\nFirst let’s remove the <NodeTooltip /> and undo our changes to <BaseNode />. In addition to pre-made nodes, React Flow UI also contains building blocks for creating your own custom nodes. To see them, we’ll add the labeled-handle component:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/labeled-handle\nThe Number Node\n\nThe first node we’ll create is a simple number node with some buttons to increment and decrement the value and a handle to connect it to other nodes. Create a folder src/components/nodes and then add a new file src/components/nodes/num-node.tsx.\n\nWe need to install the following shadcn/ui components:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dropdown-menu button\n\nNow we can start building the node. We will need to access the updateNodeData function to update the node’s data and the setNodes function to delete the node, from the useReactFlow hook. The hook helps us make self-contained components that can be used in other parts of our application, while still giving us quick access to React Flow’s state and functions.\n\nWe will need to make four callbacks, to handle the different actions that can be performed on the node.\n\nReset the node’s value to 0\nDelete the node\nIncrement the node’s value by 1\nDecrement the node’s value by 1\n\nWe will also need to access the node’s data to get the current value and update it.\n\nsrc/components/nodes/num-node.tsx\nimport { type Node, type NodeProps, Position, useReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\n \nimport {\n  BaseNode,\n  BaseNodeContent,\n  BaseNodeFooter,\n  BaseNodeHeader,\n  BaseNodeHeaderTitle,\n} from '../base-node';\nimport { LabeledHandle } from '../labeled-handle';\n \nimport { EllipsisVertical } from 'lucide-react';\nimport { Button } from '../ui/button';\nimport {\n  DropdownMenu,\n  DropdownMenuContent,\n  DropdownMenuItem,\n  DropdownMenuLabel,\n  DropdownMenuTrigger,\n} from '../ui/dropdown-menu';\n \nexport type NumNode = Node<{\n  value: number;\n}>;\n \nexport function NumNode({ id, data }: NodeProps<NumNode>) {\n  const { updateNodeData, setNodes } = useReactFlow();\n \n  const handleReset = useCallback(() => {\n    updateNodeData(id, { value: 0 });\n  }, [id, updateNodeData]);\n \n  const handleDelete = useCallback(() => {\n    setNodes((nodes) => nodes.filter((node) => node.id !== id));\n  }, [id, setNodes]);\n \n  const handleIncr = useCallback(() => {\n    updateNodeData(id, { value: data.value + 1 });\n  }, [id, data.value, updateNodeData]);\n \n  const handleDecr = useCallback(() => {\n    updateNodeData(id, { value: data.value - 1 });\n  }, [id, data.value, updateNodeData]);\n \n  return (\n    <BaseNode>\n      <BaseNodeHeader className=\"border-b\">\n        <BaseNodeHeaderTitle>Num</BaseNodeHeaderTitle>\n \n        <DropdownMenu>\n          <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>\n            <Button\n              variant=\"ghost\"\n              className=\"nodrag p-1\"\n              aria-label=\"Node Actions\"\n              title=\"Node Actions\"\n            >\n              <EllipsisVertical className=\"size-4\" />\n            </Button>\n          </DropdownMenuTrigger>\n          <DropdownMenuContent>\n            <DropdownMenuLabel className=\"font-bold\">Node Actions</DropdownMenuLabel>\n            <DropdownMenuItem onSelect={handleReset}>Reset</DropdownMenuItem>\n            <DropdownMenuItem onSelect={handleDelete}>Delete</DropdownMenuItem>\n          </DropdownMenuContent>\n        </DropdownMenu>\n      </BaseNodeHeader>\n \n      <BaseNodeContent>\n        <div className=\"flex gap-2 items-center\">\n          <Button onClick={handleDecr}>-</Button>\n          <pre>{String(data.value).padStart(3, ' ')}</pre>\n          <Button onClick={handleIncr}>+</Button>\n        </div>\n      </BaseNodeContent>\n \n      <BaseNodeFooter className=\"bg-gray-100 items-end px-0 py-1 w-full  rounded-b-md\">\n        <LabeledHandle title=\"out\" type=\"source\" position={Position.Right} />\n      </BaseNodeFooter>\n    </BaseNode>\n  );\n}\nThe Sum Node\n\nThe second node we can create is a simple sum node that adds the values of the two input nodes. Create a new file src/components/nodes/sum-node.tsx and paste the following into it:\n\nParticularly, we will need to access the getNodeConnections function to get the values of the two connected input nodes and the updateNodeData function to update the node’s data with the sum of the two input nodes inside of a useEffect hook, whenever one of the values of the input nodes changes.\n\nsrc/components/nodes/sum-node.tsx\nimport {\n  type Node,\n  type NodeProps,\n  Position,\n  useReactFlow,\n  useStore,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { useCallback, useEffect } from 'react';\n \nimport {\n  BaseNode,\n  BaseNodeContent,\n  BaseNodeFooter,\n  BaseNodeHeader,\n  BaseNodeHeaderTitle,\n} from '../base-node';\nimport { LabeledHandle } from '../labeled-handle';\nimport {\n  DropdownMenu,\n  DropdownMenuContent,\n  DropdownMenuItem,\n  DropdownMenuLabel,\n  DropdownMenuTrigger,\n} from '../ui/dropdown-menu';\nimport { EllipsisVertical } from 'lucide-react';\nimport { Button } from '../ui/button';\n \nexport type SumNode = Node<{\n  value: number;\n}>;\n \nexport function SumNode({ id }: NodeProps<SumNode>) {\n  const { updateNodeData, getNodeConnections, setNodes, setEdges } = useReactFlow();\n  const { x, y } = useStore((state) => ({\n    x: getHandleValue(\n      getNodeConnections({ nodeId: id, handleId: 'x', type: 'target' }),\n      state.nodeLookup,\n    ),\n    y: getHandleValue(\n      getNodeConnections({ nodeId: id, handleId: 'y', type: 'target' }),\n      state.nodeLookup,\n    ),\n  }));\n \n  const handleDelete = useCallback(() => {\n    setNodes((nodes) => nodes.filter((node) => node.id !== id));\n    setEdges((edges) => edges.filter((edge) => edge.source !== id));\n  }, [id, setNodes, setEdges]);\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    updateNodeData(id, { value: x + y });\n  }, [x, y]);\n \n  return (\n    <BaseNode className=\"w-32\">\n      <BaseNodeHeader className=\"border-b\">\n        <BaseNodeHeaderTitle>Sum</BaseNodeHeaderTitle>\n \n        <DropdownMenu>\n          <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>\n            <Button\n              variant=\"ghost\"\n              className=\"nodrag p-1\"\n              aria-label=\"Node Actions\"\n              title=\"Node Actions\"\n            >\n              <EllipsisVertical className=\"size-4\" />\n            </Button>\n          </DropdownMenuTrigger>\n          <DropdownMenuContent>\n            <DropdownMenuLabel className=\"font-bold\">Node Actions</DropdownMenuLabel>\n            <DropdownMenuItem onSelect={handleDelete}>Delete</DropdownMenuItem>\n          </DropdownMenuContent>\n        </DropdownMenu>\n      </BaseNodeHeader>\n \n      <BaseNodeContent className=\"px-0\">\n        <LabeledHandle title=\"x\" id=\"x\" type=\"target\" position={Position.Left} />\n        <LabeledHandle title=\"y\" id=\"y\" type=\"target\" position={Position.Left} />\n      </BaseNodeContent>\n      <BaseNodeFooter className=\"bg-gray-100 items-end px-0 py-1 w-full rounded-b-md\">\n        <LabeledHandle title=\"out\" type=\"source\" position={Position.Right} />\n      </BaseNodeFooter>\n    </BaseNode>\n  );\n}\n \nfunction getHandleValue(\n  connections: Array<{ source: string }>,\n  lookup: Map<string, Node<any>>,\n) {\n  return connections.reduce((acc, { source }) => {\n    const node = lookup.get(source)!;\n    const value = node.data.value;\n \n    return typeof value === 'number' ? acc + value : acc;\n  }, 0);\n}\nThe Data Edge\n\nReact Flow UI doesn’t just provide components for building nodes. We also provide pre-built edges and other UI elements you can drop into your flows for quick building.\n\nTo better visualize data in our calculator flow, let’s pull in the data-edge component. This edge renders a field from the source node’s data object as a label on the edge itself. Add the data-edge component to your project:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/data-edge\n\nThe <DataEdge /> component works by looking up a field from its source node’s data object. We’ve been storing the value of each node in our calculator field in a \"value\" property so we’ll update our edgeType object to include the new data-edge and we’ll update the onConnect handler to create a new edge of this type, making sure to set the edge’s data object correctly:\n\nThe Flow\n\nNow we can put everything together and create our flow.\n\nWe will start by defining the custom node and edge types, and the initial nodes and edges that will be displayed in our app.\n\nsrc/App.tsx\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  type Node,\n  type Edge,\n  type OnConnect,\n  addEdge,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport { NumNode } from './components/nodes/num-node';\nimport { SumNode } from './components/nodes/sum-node';\n \nimport { DataEdge } from './components/data-edge';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  num: NumNode,\n  sum: SumNode,\n};\n \nconst initialNodes: Node[] = [\n  { id: 'a', type: 'num', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 0, y: 0 } },\n  { id: 'b', type: 'num', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 0, y: 200 } },\n  { id: 'c', type: 'sum', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 300, y: 100 } },\n  { id: 'd', type: 'num', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 0, y: 400 } },\n  { id: 'e', type: 'sum', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 600, y: 400 } },\n];\n \nconst edgeTypes = {\n  data: DataEdge,\n};\n \nconst initialEdges: Edge[] = [\n  {\n    id: 'a->c',\n    type: 'data',\n    data: { key: 'value' },\n    source: 'a',\n    target: 'c',\n    targetHandle: 'x',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'b->c',\n    type: 'data',\n    data: { key: 'value' },\n    source: 'b',\n    target: 'c',\n    targetHandle: 'y',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'c->e',\n    type: 'data',\n    data: { key: 'value' },\n    source: 'c',\n    target: 'e',\n    targetHandle: 'x',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'd->e',\n    type: 'data',\n    data: { key: 'value' },\n    source: 'd',\n    target: 'e',\n    targetHandle: 'y',\n  },\n];\n \nfunction Flow() {\n  const [nodes, , onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);\n \n  const onConnect: OnConnect = useCallback(\n    (params) => {\n      setEdges((edges) =>\n        addEdge({ type: 'data', data: { key: 'value' }, ...params }, edges),\n      );\n    },\n    [setEdges],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"h-screen w-screen p-8 bg-gray-50 rounded-xl\">\n      <ReactFlow\n        nodes={nodes}\n        edges={edges}\n        onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n        onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n        onConnect={onConnect}\n        nodeTypes={nodeTypes}\n        edgeTypes={edgeTypes}\n        fitView\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport function App() {\n  return <Flow />;\n}\n\nPutting everything together we end up with quite a capable little calculator!\n\nYou could continue to improve this flow by adding nodes to perform other operations or to take user input using additional components from the shadcn/ui registry . In fact, keep your eyes peeled soon for a follow-up to this guide where we’ll show a complete application built using React Flow Components 👀.\n\nWrapping up\n\nIn just a short amount of time we’ve managed to build out a fairly complete flow using the components and building blocks provided by shadcn React Flow Components. We’ve learned:\n\nHow to use building blocks like the <BaseNodeHeader /> and <LabeledHandle /> components to build our own custom nodes without starting from scratch.\n\nThat React Flow UI also provides custom edges like the <DataEdge /> to drop into our applications.\n\nAnd thanks to the power of Tailwind, tweaking the visual style of these components is as simple as editing the variables in your CSS file.\n\nThat’s all for now! You can see all the components we currently have available over on the UI docs page. If you have any suggestions or requests for new components we’d love to hear about them. Or perhaps you’re already starting to build something with shadcn and React Flow UI.

A new npm package name\n\nThe package reactflow has been renamed to @xyflow/react and it’s not a default import anymore. You also need to adjust the style import. Before v12, React Flow was divided into multiple packages. That’s not the case anymore. If you just used the core, you now need to install the @xyflow/react package.\n\nOld API\n\n// npm install reactflow\nimport ReactFlow from 'reactflow';\n\nNew API\n\n// npm install @xyflow/react\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\n \n// you also need to adjust the style import\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \n// or if you just want basic styles\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/base.css';\n2. Node measured attribute for measured width and height\n\nAll measured node values are now stored in node.measured. Besides the new package name, this is the biggest change. After React Flow measures your nodes, it writes the dimensions to node.measured.width and node.measured.height. If you are using any layouting library like dagre or elk, you now need to take the dimensions from node.measured instead of node. If you are using width and height, those values will now be used as inline styles to specify the node dimensions.\n\nOld API\n\n// getting the measured width and height\nconst nodeWidth = node.width;\nconst nodeHeight = node.height;\n\nNew API\n\n// getting the measured width and height\nconst nodeWidth = node.measured?.width;\nconst nodeHeight = node.measured?.height;\n3. New dimension handling node.width / node.height vs node.measured.width / node.measured.height\n\nIn order to support server side rendering we had to restructure the API a bit, so that users can pass node dimensions more easily. For this we changed the behavior of the node.width and node.height attributes. In React Flow 11, those attributes were measured values and only used as a reference. In React Flow 12 those attributes are used as inline styles to specify the node dimensions. If you load nodes from a database, you probably want to remove the width and height attributes from your nodes, because the behavior is slightly different now. Using width and height now means that the dimensions are not dynamic based on the content but fixed.\n\nOld API\n\n// in React Flow 11 you might have used node.style to set the dimensions\nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    type: 'input',\n    data: { label: 'input node' },\n    position: { x: 250, y: 5 },\n    style: { width: 180, height: 40 },\n  },\n];\n\nNew API\n\n// in React Flow 12 you can used node.width and node.height to set the dimensions\nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    type: 'input',\n    data: { label: 'input node' },\n    position: { x: 250, y: 5 },\n    width: 180,\n    height: 40,\n  },\n];\n\nIf you want to read more about how to configure React Flow for server side rendering, you can read about it in the server side rendering guide.\n\n4. Updating nodes and edges\n\nWe are not supporting node and edge updates with object mutations anymore. If you want to update a certain attribute, you need to create a new node / edge.\n\nOld API\n\nsetNodes((currentNodes) =>\n  currentNodes.map((node) => {\n    node.hidden = true;\n    return node;\n  }),\n);\n\nNew API\n\nsetNodes((currentNodes) =>\n  currentNodes.map((node) => ({\n    ...node,\n    hidden: true,\n  })),\n);\n5. Rename onEdgeUpdate (and related APIs) to onReconnect\n\nWe renamed the onEdgeUpdate function to onReconnect and all related APIs (mentioned below). The new name is more descriptive and makes it clear that the function is used to reconnect edges.\n\nupdateEdge renamed to reconnectEdge\nonEdgeUpdateStart renamed to onReconnectStart\nonEdgeUpdate renamed to onReconnect\nonEdgeUpdateEnd renamed to onReconnectEnd\nedgeUpdaterRadius renamed to reconnectRadius\nedge.updatable renamed to edge.reconnectable\nedgesUpdatable renamed to edgesReconnectable\n\nOld API\n\n<ReactFlow\n  onEdgeUpdate={onEdgeUpdate}\n  onEdgeUpdateStart={onEdgeUpdateStart}\n  onEdgeUpdateEnd={onEdgeUpdateEnd}\n/>\n\nNew API\n\n<ReactFlow\n  onReconnect={onReconnect}\n  onReconnectStart={onReconnectStart}\n  onReconnectEnd={onReconnectEnd}\n/>\n6. Rename parentNode to parentId\n\nIf you are working with subflows, you need to rename node.parentNode to node.parentId. The parentNode attribute was a bit misleading, because it was not a reference to the parent node, but the id of the parent node.\n\nOld API\n\nconst nodes = [\n  // some nodes ...\n  {\n    id: 'xyz-id',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    type: 'default',\n    data: {},\n    parentNode: 'abc-id',\n  },\n];\n\nNew API\n\nconst nodes = [\n  // some nodes ...\n  {\n    id: 'xyz-id',\n    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n    type: 'default',\n    data: {},\n    parentId: 'abc-id',\n  },\n];\n7. Custom node props\n\nWe renamed the xPos and yPos props to positionAbsoluteX and positionAbsoluteY\n\nOld API\n\nfunction CustomNode({ xPos, yPos }) {\n  ...\n}\n\nNew API\n\nfunction CustomNode({ positionAbsoluteX, positionAbsoluteY }) {\n  ...\n}\n8. Handle component class names\n\nWe renamed some of the classes used to define the current state of a handle.\n\nreact-flow__handle-connecting renamed to connectingto / connectingfrom\nreact-flow__handle-valid renamed to valid\n9. getNodesBounds options\n\nThe type of the second param changed from nodeOrigin to options.nodeOrigin\n\nOld API\n\nconst bounds = getNodesBounds(nodes: Node[], nodeOrigin)\n\nNew API\n\nconst bounds = getNodesBounds(nodes: Node[], { nodeOrigin })\n10. Typescript changes for defining nodes and edges\n\nWe simplified types and fixed issues about functions where users could pass a NodeData generic. The new way is to define your own node type with a union of all your nodes. With this change, you can now have multiple node types with different data structures and always be able to distinguish by checking the node.type attribute.\n\nNew API\n\ntype NumberNode = Node<{ value: number }, 'number'>;\ntype TextNode = Node<{ text: string }, 'text'>;\ntype AppNode = NumberNode | TextNode;\n\nYou can then use the AppNode type as the following:\n\nconst nodes: AppNode[] = [\n  { id: '1', type: 'number', data: { value: 1 }, position: { x: 100, y: 100 } },\n  { id: '2', type: 'text', data: { text: 'Hello' }, position: { x: 200, y: 200 } },\n];\nconst onNodesChange: onNodesChange<AppNode> = useCallback((changes) => setNodes(nds => applyChanges(changes, nds)), []);\n\nYou can read more about this in the Typescript guide.\n\n11. Rename nodeInternals\n\nIf you are using nodeInternals you need to rename it to nodeLookup.\n\nOld API\n\nconst node = useStore((s) => s.nodeInternals.get(id));\n\nNew API\n\nconst node = useStore((s) => s.nodeLookup.get(id));\n12. Removal of deprecated functions\n\nWe removed the following deprecated functions:\n\ngetTransformForBounds (replaced by getViewportForBounds)\ngetRectOfNodes (replaced by getNodesBounds)\nproject (replaced by screenToFlowPosition)\ngetMarkerEndId\nupdateEdge (replaced by reconnectEdge)\n13. Custom applyNodeChanges and applyEdgeChanges\n\nIf you wrote your own function for applying changes, you need to handle the new “replace” event. We removed the “reset” event and added a “replace” event that replaces specific nodes or edges.\n\nNew features\n\nNow that you successfully migrated to v12, you can use all the fancy features. As mentioned above, the biggest updates for v12 are:\n\n1. Server side rendering\n\nYou can define width, height and handles for the nodes. This makes it possible to render a flow on the server and hydrate on the client: server side rendering guide.\n\nDetails: In v11, width and height were set by the library as soon as the nodes got measured. This still happens, but we are now using measured.width and measured.height to store this information. In the previous versions there was always a lot of confusion about width and height. It’s hard to understand, that you can’t use it for passing an actual width or height. It’s also not obvious that those attributes get added by the library. We think that the new implementation solves both of the problems: width and height are optional attributes that can be used to define dimensions and everything that is set by the library, is stored in measured.\n2. Computing flows\n\nThe new hooks useHandleConnections and useNodesData and the new updateNode and updateNodeData functions (both are part of useReactFlow) can be used to manage the data flow between your nodes: computing flows guide. We also added those helpers for edges (updateEdge and updateEdgeData)!\n\nDetails: Working with flows where one node data relies on another node is super common. You update node A and want to react on those changes in the connected node B. Until now everyone had to come up with a custom solution. With this version we want to change this and give you performant helpers to handle use cases like this.\n3. Dark mode and CSS variables\n\nReact Flow now comes with a built-in dark mode, that can be toggled by using the new colorMode prop (”light”, “dark” or “system”): dark mode example\n\nDetails: With this version we want to make it easier to switch between dark and light modes and give you a better starting point for dark flows. If you pass colorMode=\"dark\", we add the class name “dark” to the wrapper and use it to adjust the styling. To make the implementation for this new feature easier on our ends, we switched to CSS variables for most of the styles. These variables can also be used in user land to customize a flow.\n4. A better DX with TSDoc\n\nWe started to use TSDoc for a better DX. While developing your IDE will now show you the documentation for the props and hooks. This is a big step for us to make the library more accessible and easier to use. We will also use TSDoc in the near future to generate the documentation.\n\nMore features and updates\n\nThere is more! Besides the new main features, we added some minor things that were on our list for a long time:\n\nuseConnection hook: With this hook you can access the ongoing connection. For example, you can use it for colorizing handles styling a custom connection line based on the current start / end handles.\nControlled viewport: This is an advanced feature. Possible use cases are to animate the viewport or round the transform for lower res screens for example. This features brings two new props: viewport and onViewportChange.\nViewportPortal component: This makes it possible to render elements in the viewport without the need to implement a custom node.\nonDelete handler: We added a combined handler for onDeleteNodes and onDeleteEdges to make it easier to react to deletions.\nonBeforeDelete handler: With this handler you can prevent/ manage deletions.\nisValidConnection prop: This makes it possible to implement one validation function for all connections. It also gets called for programmatically added edges.\nautoPanSpeed prop: For controlling the speed while auto panning.\npaneClickDistance prop: max distance between mousedown/up that will trigger a click.\nBackground component: add patternClassName prop to be able to style the background pattern by using a class name. This is useful if you want to style the background pattern with Tailwind for example.\nonMove callback gets triggered for library-invoked viewport updates (like fitView or zoom-in)\ndeleteElements now returns deleted nodes and deleted edges\nadd origin attribute for nodes\nadd selectable attribute for edges\nNode Resizer updates: child nodes don’t move when the group is resized, extent and expand is recognized correctly\nCorrect types for BezierEdge, StepEdge, SmoothStepEdge and StraightEdge components\nNew edges created by the library only have sourceHandle and targetHandle attributes when those attributes are set. (We used to pass sourceHandle: null and targetHandle: null)\nEdges do not mount/unmount when their z-index change\nconnection line knows about the target handle position so that the path is drawn correctly\nnodeDragThreshold is 1 by default instead of 0\na better selection box usability (capture while dragging out of the flow)\nadd selectable, deletable, draggable and parentId to NodeProps\nadd a warning when styles not loaded\nInternal changes\n\nThese changes are not really user-facing, but it could be important for folks who are working with the internal React Flow store:\n\nThe biggest internal change is that we created a new package @xyflow/system with framework agnostic helpers that can be used by React Flow and Svelte Flow\nXYDrag for handling dragging node(s) and selection\nXYPanZoom for controlling the viewport panning and zooming\nXYHandle for managing new connections\nWe renamed nodeInternals to nodeLookup. That map serves as a lookup, but we are not creating a new map object on any change so it’s really only useful as a lookup.\nWe removed the internal “reset” event and added a “replace” event to be able to update specific nodes.\nWe removed connectionNodeId, connectionHandleId, connectionHandleType from the store and added connection.fromHandle.nodeId, connection.fromHandle.id, …\nadd data-id to edges\nonNodeDragStart, onNodeDrag and onNodeDragStop also get called when user drags a selection (in addition to onSelectionDragStart, onSelectionDrag, onSelectionDragStop)\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nRemove Attribution\nMigrate to v11\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

The biggest change is the new package name reactflow and the new repo structure. React Flow is now managed as a monorepo and separated into multiple packages that can be installed separately. In addition to that, there are some API changes and new APIs introduced in v11. This guide explains the changes in detail and helps you to migrate from v10 to v11.\n\nReact Flow 11 only works with React 17 or greater\nNew Features\nBetter Accessibility\nNodes and edges are focusable, selectable, moveable and deletable with the keyboard.\naria- default attributes for all elements and controllable via ariaLabel options\nKeyboard controls can be disabled with the new disableKeyboardA11y prop\nBetter selectable edges via new edge option: interactionWidth - renders invisible edge that makes it easier to interact\nBetter routing for smoothstep and step edges: https://twitter.com/reactflowdev/status/1567535405284614145 \nNicer edge updating behavior: https://twitter.com/reactflowdev/status/1564966917517021184 \nNode origin: The new nodeOrigin prop lets you control the origin of a node. Useful for layouting.\nNew background pattern: BackgroundVariant.Cross variant\nuseOnViewportChange hook - handle viewport changes within a component\nuse-on-selection-change hook - handle selection changes within a component\nuseNodesInitialized hook - returns true if all nodes are initialized and if there is more than one node\nDeletable option for Nodes and edges\nNew Event handlers: onPaneMouseEnter, onPaneMouseMove and onPaneMouseLeave\nEdge pathOptions for smoothstep and default edges\nNicer cursor defaults: Cursor is grabbing, while dragging a node or panning\nPane moveable with middle mouse button\nPan over nodes when they are not draggable (draggable=false or nodesDraggable false)\nyou can disable this behavior by adding the class name nopan to a wrapper of a custom node\n<BaseEdge /> component that makes it easier to build custom edges\nSeparately installable packages\n@reactflow/core\n@reactflow/background\n@reactflow/controls\n@reactflow/minimap\nBreaking Changes\n1. New npm package name\n\nThe package react-flow-renderer has been renamed to reactflow.\n\nOld API\n// npm install react-flow-renderer\nimport ReactFlow from 'react-flow-renderer';\nNew API\n// npm install reactflow\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\n2. Importing CSS is mandatory\n\nWe are not injecting CSS anymore. React Flow won’t work if you are not loading the styles!\n\n// default styling\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \n// or if you just want basic styles\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/base.css';\n2.1. Removal of the nocss entrypoint\n\nThis change also means that there is no react-flow-renderer/nocss entry point anymore. If you used that, you need to adjust the CSS entry points as mentioned above.\n\n3. defaultPosition and defaultZoom have been merged to defaultViewport\nOld API\nimport ReactFlow from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \nconst Flow = () => {\n  return <ReactFlow defaultPosition={[10, 15]} defaultZoom={5} />;\n};\n \nexport default Flow;\nNew API\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nconst defaultViewport: Viewport = { x: 10, y: 15, zoom: 5 };\n \nconst Flow = () => {\n  return <ReactFlow defaultViewport={defaultViewport} />;\n};\n \nexport default Flow;\n4. Removal of getBezierEdgeCenter, getSimpleBezierEdgeCenter and getEdgeCenter\n\nIn v10 we had getBezierEdgeCenter, getSimpleBezierEdgeCenter and getEdgeCenter for getting the center of a certain edge type. In v11 we changed the helper function for creating the path, so that it also returns the center / label position of an edge.\n\nLet’s say you want to get the path and the center / label position of a bezier edge:\n\nOld API\nimport { getBezierEdgeCenter, getBezierPath } from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \nconst path = getBezierPath(edgeParams);\nconst [centerX, centerY] = getBezierEdgeCenter(params);\nNew API\nimport { getBezierPath } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nconst [path, labelX, labelY] = getBezierPath(edgeParams);\n\nWe avoid to call it centerX and centerY anymore, because it’s actually the label position and not always the center for every edge type.\n\n5. Removal of onClickConnectStop and onConnectStop\nOld API\nimport ReactFlow from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \nconst Flow = () => {\n  const onConnectStop = () => console.log('on connect stop');\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      defaultNodes={defaultNodes}\n      defaultEdges={defaultEdges}\n      onConnectStop={onConnectStop}\n      onClickConnectStop={onConnectStop}\n    />\n  );\n};\n \nexport default Flow;\nNew API\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nconst Flow = () => {\n  const onConnectEnd = () => console.log('on connect stop');\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      defaultNodes={defaultNodes}\n      defaultEdges={defaultEdges}\n      onConnectEnd={onConnectEnd}\n      onClickConnectEnd={onConnectEnd}\n    />\n  );\n};\n \nexport default Flow;\n6. Pan over nodes\n\nIn the previous versions you couldn’t pan over nodes even if they were not draggable. In v11, you can pan over nodes when nodesDraggable=false or node option draggable=false. If you want the old behavior back, you can add the class name nopan to the wrappers of your custom nodes.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nMigrate to v12\nMigrate to v10\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

If you are looking for guides and tutorials, please refer to our learn section.\n\nHow to use this reference\n\nWe think that documentation should answer two broad questions: “what is this thing?” and “how do I use it?”\n\nTo that end, our API reference aims to concisely answer that first question and learn section goes into more detail on the second. If you find yourself clicking around the reference wondering what the heck any of this means, maybe we have a guide that can help you out!\n\nCustom nodes\n\nA powerful feature of React Flow is the ability to add custom nodes. Within your custom nodes you can render everything you want. You can define multiple source and target handles and render form inputs or charts for example. In this guide we will implement a node with an input field that updates some text in another part of the application.\n\nRead more \n\nLayouting\n\nWe regularly get asked how to handle layouting in React Flow. While we could build some basic layouting into React Flow, we believe that you know your app's requirements best and with so many options out there we think it's better you choose the best right tool for the job. In this guide we'll look at four layouting libraries and how to use them.\n\nRead more \nA note for our long-term users\n\nIf you’re coming here from our old API pages things might look a bit different! We’ve reorganized our documentation to make it easier to look things up if you know what you’re looking for. All our types, components, hooks, and util functions get their own page now to help you find exactly what you need.\n\nIf you’re new to React Flow or you’re not sure where to look for something, take a look at the section below.\n\nA note for JavaScript users\n\nReact Flow is written in TypeScript, but we know that not everyone uses it. We encourage developers to use the technology that works best for them, and throughout our documentation there is a blend of TypeScript and JavaScript examples.\n\nFor our API reference, however, we use TypeScript’s syntax to document the types of props and functions. Here’s a quick crash course on how to read it:\n\n• ? means that the field or argument is optional.\n\n• <T> in a type definition represents a generic type parameter. Like a function argument but for types! The definition type Array<T> = ... means a type called Array that takes a generic type parameter T.\n\n• <T> when referring to a type is like “filling in” a generic type parameter. It’s like calling a function but for types! The type Array<number> is the type Array with the generic type parameter T filled in with the type number.\n\n• T | U means that the type is either T or U: this is often called a union.\n\n• T & U means that the type is both T and U: this is often called an intersection.\n\nThe TypeScript folks have their own handy guide for reading types  that you might find useful.

With the major version update, there are coming many new features but also some breaking changes.\n\nNew Features\nSub Flows: You can now add nodes to a parent node and create groups and nested flows\nNode Type ‘group’: A new node type without handles that can be used as a group node\nTouch Device Support: It is now possible to connect nodes on touch devices\nFit View on Init: You can use the new fitView prop to fit the initial view\nKey Handling: Not only single keys but also multiple keys and key combinations are possible now\nuseKeyPress hook: A util hook for handling keyboard events\nuseReactFlow hook: Returns a React Flow instance that exposes functions to manipulate the flow\nuseNodes, useEdges and useViewport hooks: Hooks for receiving nodes, edges and the viewport\nEdge Marker: More options to configure the start and end markers of an edge\nBreaking Changes\n\nTLDR:\n\nSplit the elements array into nodes and edges arrays and implement onNodesChange and onEdgesChange handlers (detailed guide in the core concepts section)\nMemoize your custom nodeTypes and edgeTypes\nRename onLoad to onInit\nRename paneMoveable to panOnDrag\nRename useZoomPanHelper to useReactFlow (and setTransform to setViewport)\nRename node and edge option isHidden to hidden\n\nDetailed explanation of breaking changes:\n\n1. Elements - Nodes and Edges\n\nWe saw that a lot of people struggle with the semi controlled elements prop. It was always a bit messy to sync the local user state with the internal state of React Flow. Some of you used the internal store that was never documented and always a kind of hacky solution. For the new version we offer two ways to use React Flow - uncontrolled and controlled.\n\n1.1. Controlled nodes and edges\n\nIf you want to have the full control and use nodes and edges from your local state or your store, you can use the nodes, edges props in combination with the onNodesChange and onEdgesChange handlers. You need to implement these handlers for an interactive flow (if you are fine with just pan and zoom you don’t need them). You’ll receive a change when a node(s) gets initialized, dragged, selected or removed. This means that you always know the exact position and dimensions of a node or if it’s selected for example. We export the helper functions applyNodeChanges and applyEdgeChanges that you should use to apply the changes.\n\nOld API\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { ReactFlow, removeElements, addEdge } from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \nconst initialElements = [\n  { id: '1', data: { label: 'Node 1' }, position: { x: 250, y: 0 } },\n  { id: '2', data: { label: 'Node 2' }, position: { x: 150, y: 100 } },\n  { id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' },\n];\n \nconst BasicFlow = () => {\n  const [elements, setElements] = useState(initialElements);\n  const onElementsRemove = useCallback(\n    (elementsToRemove) =>\n      setElements((els) => removeElements(elementsToRemove, els)),\n    [],\n  );\n  const onConnect = useCallback((connection) =>\n    setElements((es) => addEdge(connection, es)),\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      elements={elements}\n      onElementsRemove={onElementsRemove}\n      onConnect={onConnect}\n    />\n  );\n};\n \nexport default BasicFlow;\nNew API\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  applyNodeChanges,\n  applyEdgeChanges,\n  addEdge,\n} from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  { id: '1', data: { label: 'Node 1' }, position: { x: 250, y: 0 } },\n  { id: '2', data: { label: 'Node 2' }, position: { x: 150, y: 100 } },\n];\n \nconst initialEdges = [{ id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }];\n \nconst BasicFlow = () => {\n  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges] = useState(initialEdges);\n \n  const onNodesChange = useCallback(\n    (changes) => setNodes((ns) => applyNodeChanges(changes, ns)),\n    [],\n  );\n  const onEdgesChange = useCallback(\n    (changes) => setEdges((es) => applyEdgeChanges(changes, es)),\n    [],\n  );\n  const onConnect = useCallback((connection) =>\n    setEdges((eds) => addEdge(connection, eds)),\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={nodes}\n      edges={edges}\n      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n      onConnect={onConnect}\n    />\n  );\n};\n \nexport default BasicFlow;\n\nYou can also use the new hooks useNodesState and useEdgesState for a quick start:\n\nconst [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\nconst [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);\n\nrelated changes:\n\nonElementsClick ->onNodeClick and onEdgeClick\nonElementsRemove -> replaced by the onNodesChange and onEdgesChange handler\n1.2 Uncontrolled defaultNodes and defaultEdges\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to use the defaultNodes and defaultEdges props. When you set these props, all actions are handled internally. You don’t need to add any other handlers to get a fully interactive flow with the ability to drag nodes, connect nodes and remove nodes and edges:\n\nNew API\nimport ReactFlow from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \nconst defaultNodes = [\n  { id: '1', data: { label: 'Node 1' }, position: { x: 250, y: 0 } },\n  { id: '2', data: { label: 'Node 2' }, position: { x: 150, y: 100 } },\n];\n \nconst defaultEdges = [{ id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }];\n \nconst BasicFlow = () => {\n  return <ReactFlow defaultNodes={defaultNodes} defaultEdges={defaultEdges} />;\n};\n \nexport default BasicFlow;\n\nIf you want to add, remove or update a node or edge you can only do this by using the ReactFlow instance that you can receive either with the new useReactFlow hook or by using the onInit handler that gets the instance as a function param.\n\n2. Memoize your custom nodeTypes and edgeTypes\n\nWhenever you pass new node or edge types, we create wrapped node or edge component types in the background. This means that you should not create a new nodeType or edgeType object on every render. Memoize your nodeTypes and edgeTypes or define them outside of the component when they don’t change.\n\nDon’t do this:\n\nThis creates a new object on every render and leads to bugs and performance issues:\n\n// this is bad! Don't do it.\n<ReactFlow\n  nodes={[]}\n  nodeTypes={{\n    specialType: SpecialNode, // bad!\n  }}\n/>\n\nDo this:\n\nfunction Flow() {\n  const nodeTypes = useMemo(() => ({ specialType: SpecialNode }), []);\n \n  return <ReactFlow nodes={[]} nodeTypes={nodeTypes} />;\n}\n\nor create the types outside of the component when they don’t change:\n\nconst nodeTypes = { specialType: SpecialNode };\n \nfunction Flow() {\n  return <ReactFlow nodes={[]} nodeTypes={nodeTypes} />;\n}\n3. Redux - Zustand\n\nWe switched our state management library from Redux to Zustand . With this change we could remove about 300LOC from our state related code. If you need to access the internal store, you can use the useStore hook:\n\nOld API\nimport { useStoreState, useStoreActions } from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \n...\n \nconst transform = useStoreState((store) => store.transform);\nNew API\nimport { useStore } from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \n...\nconst transform = useStore((store) => store.transform);\n\nYou still need to wrap your component with the <ReactFlowProvider /> if you want to access the internal store.\n\nWe are also exporting useStoreApi if you need to get the store in an event handler for example without triggering re-renders.\n\nimport { useStoreApi } from 'react-flow-renderer';\n \n...\n \nconst store = useStoreApi();\n \n...\n// in an event handler\nconst [x, y, zoom] = store.getState().transform;\n4. onLoad - onInit\n\nThe onLoad callback has been renamed to onInit and now fires when the nodes are initialized.\n\nOld API\nconst onLoad = (reactFlowInstance: OnLoadParams) => reactFlowInstance.zoomTo(2);\n...\n<ReactFlow\n   ...\n  onLoad={onLoad}\n/>\nNew API\nconst onInit = (reactFlowInstance: ReactFlowInstance) => reactFlowInstance.zoomTo(2);\n...\n<ReactFlow\n   ...\n  onInit={onInit}\n/>\n5. paneMoveable - panOnDrag\n\nThis is more consistent with the rest of the API (panOnScroll, zoomOnScroll, etc.)\n\nOld API\n<ReactFlow\n   ...\n  paneMoveable={false}\n/>\nNew API\n<ReactFlow\n   ...\n  panOnDrag={false}\n/>\n6. useZoomPanHelper transform - unified in useReactFlow\n\nAs “transform” is also the variable name of the transform in the store and it’s not clear that transform is a setter we renamed it to setViewport. This is also more consistent with the other functions. Also, all useZoomPanHelper functions have been moved to the React Flow instance that you get from the useReactFlow hook or the onInit handler.\n\nOld API\nconst { transform, setCenter, setZoom  } = useZoomPanHelper();\n...\ntransform({ x: 100, y: 100, zoom: 2 });\nNew API\nconst { setViewport, setCenter, setZoom } = useReactFlow();\n...\nsetViewport({ x: 100, y: 100, zoom: 2 });\n\nNew viewport functions:\n\ngetZoom\ngetViewport\n7. isHidden - hidden\n\nWe mixed prefixed (is...) and non-prefixed boolean option names. All node and edge options are not prefixed anymore. So it’s hidden, animated, selected, draggable, selectable and connectable.\n\nOld API\nconst hiddenNode = { id: '1', isHidden: true, position: { x: 50, y: 50 } };\nNew API\nconst hiddenNode = { id: '1', hidden: true, position: { x: 50, y: 50 } };\n8. arrowHeadType markerEndId - markerStart / markerEnd\n\nWe improved the API for customizing the markers for an edge. With the new API you are able to set individual markers at the start and the end of an edge as well as customizing them with colors, strokeWidth etc. You still have the ability to set a markerEndId but instead of using different properties, the markerStart and markerEnd property accepts either a string (id for the svg marker that you need to define yourself) or a configuration object for using the built in arrowClosed or arrow markers.\n\nOld API\nconst markerEdge = { source: '1', target: '2', arrowHeadType: 'arrow' };\nNew API\nconst markerEdge = {\n  source: '1',\n  target: '2',\n  markerStart: 'myCustomSvgMarker',\n  markerEnd: { type: 'arrow', color: '#f00' },\n};\n9. ArrowHeadType - MarkerType\n\nThis is just a wording change for making the marker API more consistent. As we are now able to set markers for the start of the edge, the name type ArrowHeadType has been renamed to MarkerType. In the future, this can also not only contain arrow shapes but others like circles, diamonds etc.\n\n10. Attribution\n\nThis is not really a breaking change to the API but a little change in the general appearance of React Flow. We added a tiny “React Flow” attribution to the bottom right (the position is configurable via the attributionPosition prop). This change comes with the new “React Flow Pro” subscription model. If you want to remove the attribution in a commercial application, please subscribe to “React Flow Pro”.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nMigrate to v11\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

If you are looking for guides and tutorials, please refer to our learn section.\n\nHow to use this reference\n\nWe think that documentation should answer two broad questions: “what is this thing?” and “how do I use it?”\n\nTo that end, our API reference aims to concisely answer that first question and learn section goes into more detail on the second. If you find yourself clicking around the reference wondering what the heck any of this means, maybe we have a guide that can help you out!\n\nCustom nodes\n\nA powerful feature of React Flow is the ability to add custom nodes. Within your custom nodes you can render everything you want. You can define multiple source and target handles and render form inputs or charts for example. In this guide we will implement a node with an input field that updates some text in another part of the application.\n\nRead more \n\nLayouting\n\nWe regularly get asked how to handle layouting in React Flow. While we could build some basic layouting into React Flow, we believe that you know your app's requirements best and with so many options out there we think it's better you choose the best right tool for the job. In this guide we'll look at four layouting libraries and how to use them.\n\nRead more \nA note for our long-term users\n\nIf you’re coming here from our old API pages things might look a bit different!

It comes with three variants: lines, dots and cross.\n\nRead more \n<BaseEdge />\n\nThe BaseEdge component gets used internally for all the edges. It can be used inside a custom edge and handles the invisible helper edge and the edge label for you.\n\nRead more \n<ControlButton />\n\nYou can add buttons to the control panel by using the ControlButton component and pass it as a child to the Controls component.\n\nRead more \n<Controls />\n\nThe Controls component renders a small panel that contains convenient buttons to zoom in, zoom out, fit the view, and lock the viewport.\n\nRead more \n<EdgeLabelRenderer />\n\nEdges are SVG-based. If you want to render more complex labels you can use the EdgeLabelRenderer component to access a div based renderer. This component is a portal that renders the label in a div that is positioned on top of the edges. You can see an example usage of the component in the edge label renderer example.\n\nRead more \n<EdgeText />\n\nYou can use the EdgeText component as a helper component to display text within your custom edges.\n\nRead more \n<EdgeToolbar />\n\nThe EdgeToolbar component can render a toolbar or tooltip to one side of a custom edge. This toolbar doesn't scale with the viewport so that the content doesn't get too small when zooming out.\n\nRead more \n<Handle />\n\nThe Handle component is used in your custom nodes to define connection points.\n\nRead more \n<MiniMap />\n\nThe MiniMap component can be used to render an overview of your flow. It renders each node as an SVG element and visualizes where the current viewport is in relation to the rest of the flow.\n\nRead more \n<NodeResizeControl />\n\nTo create your own resizing UI, you can use the NodeResizeControl component where you can pass children (such as icons).\n\nRead more \n<NodeResizer />\n\nThe NodeResizer component can be used to add a resize functionality to your nodes. It renders draggable controls around the node to resize in all directions.\n\nRead more \n<NodeToolbar />\n\nThe NodeToolbar component can render a toolbar or tooltip to one side of a custom node.

It renders your nodes and edges, handles user interaction, and can manage its own state if used as an uncontrolled flow.\n\nimport { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react'\n \nexport default function Flow() {\n  return <ReactFlow\n    nodes={...}\n    edges={...}\n    onNodesChange={...}\n    ...\n  />\n}\n\nThis component takes a lot of different props, most of which are optional. We’ve tried to document them in groups that make sense to help you find your way.\n\nCommon props\n\nThese are the props you will most commonly use when working with React Flow. If you are working with a controlled flow with custom nodes, you will likely use almost all of these!\n\nName\tType\tDefault\n\nwidth\tnumber\n\nSets a fixed width for the flow.\n\n\t\n\nheight\tnumber\n\nSets a fixed height for the flow.\n\n\t\n\nnodes\tNode[]\n\nAn array of nodes to render in a controlled flow.\n\n\t[]\n\nedges\tEdge[]\n\nAn array of edges to render in a controlled flow.\n\n\t[]\n\ndefaultNodes\tNode[]\n\nThe initial nodes to render in an uncontrolled flow.\n\n\t\n\ndefaultEdges\tEdge[]\n\nThe initial edges to render in an uncontrolled flow.\n\n\t\n\npaneClickDistance\tnumber\n\nDistance that the mouse can move between mousedown/up that will trigger a click.\n\n\t0\n\nnodeClickDistance\tnumber\n\nDistance that the mouse can move between mousedown/up that will trigger a click.\n\n\t0\n\nnodeTypes\tNodeTypes\n\nCustom node types to be available in a flow. React Flow matches a node’s type to a component in the nodeTypes object.\n\n\t{\ninput: InputNode,\ndefault: DefaultNode,\noutput: OutputNode,\ngroup: GroupNode\n}\n\nedgeTypes\tEdgeTypes\n\nCustom edge types to be available in a flow. React Flow matches an edge’s type to a component in the edgeTypes object.\n\n\t{\ndefault: BezierEdge,\nstraight: StraightEdge,\nstep: StepEdge,\nsmoothstep: SmoothStepEdge,\nsimplebezier: SimpleBezier\n}\n\nautoPanOnNodeFocus\tboolean\n\nWhen true, the viewport will pan when a node is focused.\n\n\ttrue\n\nnodeOrigin\tNodeOrigin\n\nThe origin of the node to use when placing it in the flow or looking up its x and y position. An origin of [0, 0] means that a node’s top left corner will be placed at the x and y position.\n\n\t[0, 0]\n\nproOptions\tProOptions\n\nBy default, we render a small attribution in the corner of your flows that links back to the project.\n\nAnyone is free to remove this attribution whether they’re a Pro subscriber or not but we ask that you take a quick look at our https://reactflow.dev/learn/troubleshooting/remove-attribution  removing attribution guide before doing so.\n\n\t\n\nnodeDragThreshold\tnumber\n\nWith a threshold greater than zero you can delay node drag events. If threshold equals 1, you need to drag the node 1 pixel before a drag event is fired. 1 is the default value, so that clicks don’t trigger drag events.\n\n\t1\n\nconnectionDragThreshold\tnumber\n\nThe threshold in pixels that the mouse must move before a connection line starts to drag. This is useful to prevent accidental connections when clicking on a handle.\n\n\t1\n\ncolorMode\tColorMode\n\nControls color scheme used for styling the flow.\n\n\t'light'\n\ndebug\tboolean\n\nIf set true, some debug information will be logged to the console like which events are fired.\n\n\tfalse\n\nariaLabelConfig\tPartial<AriaLabelConfig>\n\nConfiguration for customizable labels, descriptions, and UI text. Provided keys will override the corresponding defaults. Allows localization, customization of ARIA descriptions, control labels, minimap labels, and other UI strings.\n\n\t\n\n...props\tOmit<DetailedHTMLProps<HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>, HTMLDivElement>, \"onError\">\t\nViewport props\nName\tType\tDefault\n\ndefaultViewport\tViewport\n\nSets the initial position and zoom of the viewport. If a default viewport is provided but fitView is enabled, the default viewport will be ignored.\n\n\t{ x: 0, y: 0, zoom: 1 }\n\nviewport\tViewport\n\nWhen you pass a viewport prop, it’s controlled, and you also need to pass onViewportChange to handle internal changes.\n\n\t\n\nonViewportChange\t(viewport: Viewport) => void\n\nUsed when working with a controlled viewport for updating the user viewport state.\n\n\t\n\nfitView\tboolean\n\nWhen true, the flow will be zoomed and panned to fit all the nodes initially provided.\n\n\t\n\nfitViewOptions\tFitViewOptionsBase<NodeType>\n\nWhen you typically call fitView on a ReactFlowInstance, you can provide an object of options to customize its behavior. This prop lets you do the same for the initial fitView call.\n\n\t\n\nminZoom\tnumber\n\nMinimum zoom level.\n\n\t0.5\n\nmaxZoom\tnumber\n\nMaximum zoom level.\n\n\t2\n\nsnapToGrid\tboolean\n\nWhen enabled, nodes will snap to the grid when dragged.\n\n\t\n\nsnapGrid\tSnapGrid\n\nIf snapToGrid is enabled, this prop configures the grid that nodes will snap to.\n\n\t\n\nonlyRenderVisibleElements\tboolean\n\nYou can enable this optimisation to instruct React Flow to only render nodes and edges that would be visible in the viewport.\n\nThis might improve performance when you have a large number of nodes and edges but also adds an overhead.\n\n\tfalse\n\ntranslateExtent\tCoordinateExtent\n\nBy default, the viewport extends infinitely. You can use this prop to set a boundary. The first pair of coordinates is the top left boundary and the second pair is the bottom right.\n\n\t[[-∞, -∞], [+∞, +∞]]\n\nnodeExtent\tCoordinateExtent\n\nBy default, nodes can be placed on an infinite flow. You can use this prop to set a boundary. The first pair of coordinates is the top left boundary and the second pair is the bottom right.\n\n\t\n\npreventScrolling\tboolean\n\nDisabling this prop will allow the user to scroll the page even when their pointer is over the flow.\n\n\ttrue\n\nattributionPosition\tPanelPosition\n\nBy default, React Flow will render a small attribution in the bottom right corner of the flow.\n\nYou can use this prop to change its position in case you want to place something else there.\n\n\t'bottom-right'\nEdge props\nName\tType\tDefault\n\nelevateEdgesOnSelect\tboolean\n\nEnabling this option will raise the z-index of edges when they are selected.\n\n\tfalse\n\ndefaultMarkerColor\tstring | null\n\nColor of edge markers. You can pass null to use the CSS variable --xy-edge-stroke for the marker color.\n\n\t'#b1b1b7'\n\ndefaultEdgeOptions\tDefaultEdgeOptions\n\nDefaults to be applied to all new edges that are added to the flow. Properties on a new edge will override these defaults if they exist.\n\n\t\n\nreconnectRadius\tnumber\n\nThe radius around an edge connection that can trigger an edge reconnection.\n\n\t10\n\nedgesReconnectable\tboolean\n\nWhether edges can be updated once they are created. When both this prop is true and an onReconnect handler is provided, the user can drag an existing edge to a new source or target. Individual edges can override this value with their reconnectable property.\n\n\ttrue\nEvent handlers\nWarning\n\nIt’s important to remember to define any event handlers outside of your component or using React’s useCallback hook. If you don’t, this can cause React Flow to enter an infinite re-render loop!\n\nGeneral Events\nName\tType\tDefault\n\nonError\tOnError\n\nOccasionally something may happen that causes React Flow to throw an error.\n\nInstead of exploding your application, we log a message to the console and then call this event handler. You might use it for additional logging or to show a message to the user.\n\n\t\n\nonInit\t(reactFlowInstance: ReactFlowInstance<Node, Edge>) => void\n\nThe onInit callback is called when the viewport is initialized. At this point you can use the instance to call methods like fitView or zoomTo.\n\n\t\n\nonDelete\tOnDelete<Node, Edge>\n\nThis event handler gets called when a node or edge is deleted.\n\n\t\n\nonBeforeDelete\tOnBeforeDelete<Node, Edge>\n\nThis handler is called before nodes or edges are deleted, allowing the deletion to be aborted by returning false or modified by returning updated nodes and edges.\n\n\t\nNode Events\nName\tType\tDefault\n\nonNodeClick\tNodeMouseHandler<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when a user clicks on a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodeDoubleClick\tNodeMouseHandler<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when a user double-clicks on a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodeDragStart\tOnNodeDrag<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when a user starts to drag a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodeDrag\tOnNodeDrag<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when a user drags a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodeDragStop\tOnNodeDrag<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when a user stops dragging a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodeMouseEnter\tNodeMouseHandler<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when mouse of a user enters a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodeMouseMove\tNodeMouseHandler<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when mouse of a user moves over a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodeMouseLeave\tNodeMouseHandler<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when mouse of a user leaves a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodeContextMenu\tNodeMouseHandler<Node>\n\nThis event handler is called when a user right-clicks on a node.\n\n\t\n\nonNodesDelete\tOnNodesDelete<Node>\n\nThis event handler gets called when a node is deleted.\n\n\t\n\nonNodesChange\tOnNodesChange<Node>\n\nUse this event handler to add interactivity to a controlled flow. It is called on node drag, select, and move.\n\n\t\nEdge Events\nName\tType\tDefault\n\nonEdgeClick\t(event: MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>, edge: Edge) => void\n\nThis event handler is called when a user clicks on an edge.\n\n\t\n\nonEdgeDoubleClick\tEdgeMouseHandler<Edge>\n\nThis event handler is called when a user double-clicks on an edge.\n\n\t\n\nonEdgeMouseEnter\tEdgeMouseHandler<Edge>\n\nThis event handler is called when mouse of a user enters an edge.\n\n\t\n\nonEdgeMouseMove\tEdgeMouseHandler<Edge>\n\nThis event handler is called when mouse of a user moves over an edge.\n\n\t\n\nonEdgeMouseLeave\tEdgeMouseHandler<Edge>\n\nThis event handler is called when mouse of a user leaves an edge.\n\n\t\n\nonEdgeContextMenu\tEdgeMouseHandler<Edge>\n\nThis event handler is called when a user right-clicks on an edge.\n\n\t\n\nonReconnect\tOnReconnect<Edge>\n\nThis handler is called when the source or target of a reconnectable edge is dragged from the current node. It will fire even if the edge’s source or target do not end up changing. You can use the reconnectEdge utility to convert the connection to a new edge.\n\n\t\n\nonReconnectStart\t(event: MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>, edge: Edge, handleType: HandleType) => void\n\nThis event fires when the user begins dragging the source or target of an editable edge.\n\n\t\n\nonReconnectEnd\t(event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent, edge: Edge, handleType: HandleType, connectionState: FinalConnectionState) => void\n\nThis event fires when the user releases the source or target of an editable edge.

We’ve tried to set up sensible defaults like using backspace to delete any selected nodes or edges, but you can use these props to set your own.\n\nTo disable any of these shortcuts, pass in null to the prop you want to disable.\n\nName\tType\tDefault\n\ndeleteKeyCode\tKeyCode | null\n\nIf set, pressing the key or chord will delete any selected nodes and edges. Passing an array represents multiple keys that can be pressed.\n\nFor example, [\"Delete\", \"Backspace\"] will delete selected elements when either key is pressed.\n\n\t'Backspace'\n\nselectionKeyCode\tKeyCode | null\n\nIf set, holding this key will let you click and drag to draw a selection box around multiple nodes and edges. Passing an array represents multiple keys that can be pressed.\n\nFor example, [\"Shift\", \"Meta\"] will allow you to draw a selection box when either key is pressed.\n\n\t'Shift'\n\nmultiSelectionKeyCode\tKeyCode | null\n\nPressing down this key you can select multiple elements by clicking.\n\n\t\"Meta\" for macOS, \"Control\" for other systems\n\nzoomActivationKeyCode\tKeyCode | null\n\nIf a key is set, you can zoom the viewport while that key is held down even if panOnScroll is set to false.\n\nBy setting this prop to null you can disable this functionality.\n\n\t\"Meta\" for macOS, \"Control\" for other systems\n\npanActivationKeyCode\tKeyCode | null\n\nIf a key is set, you can pan the viewport while that key is held down even if panOnScroll is set to false.\n\nBy setting this prop to null you can disable this functionality.\n\n\t'Space'\n\ndisableKeyboardA11y\tboolean\n\nYou can use this prop to disable keyboard accessibility features such as selecting nodes or moving selected nodes with the arrow keys.\n\n\tfalse\nStyle props\n\nApplying certain classes to elements rendered inside the canvas will change how interactions are handled. These props let you configure those class names if you need to.\n\nName\tType\tDefault\n\nnoPanClassName\tstring\n\nIf an element in the canvas does not stop mouse events from propagating, clicking and dragging that element will pan the viewport. Adding the \"nopan\" class prevents this behavior and this prop allows you to change the name of that class.\n\n\t\"nopan\"\n\nnoDragClassName\tstring\n\nIf a node is draggable, clicking and dragging that node will move it around the canvas. Adding the \"nodrag\" class prevents this behavior and this prop allows you to change the name of that class.\n\n\t\"nodrag\"\n\nnoWheelClassName\tstring\n\nTypically, scrolling the mouse wheel when the mouse is over the canvas will zoom the viewport. Adding the \"nowheel\" class to an element in the canvas will prevent this behavior and this prop allows you to change the name of that class.\n\n\t\"nowheel\"\nNotes\nThe props of this component get exported as ReactFlowProps\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nAPI Reference\n<ReactFlowProvider />\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

If you want to render more complex labels you can use the <EdgeLabelRenderer /> component to access a div based renderer. This component is a portal that renders the label in a <div /> that is positioned on top of the edges. You can see an example usage of the component in the edge label renderer example.\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { getBezierPath, EdgeLabelRenderer, BaseEdge } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nconst CustomEdge = ({ id, data, ...props }) => {\n  const [edgePath, labelX, labelY] = getBezierPath(props);\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <BaseEdge id={id} path={edgePath} />\n      <EdgeLabelRenderer>\n        <div\n          style={{\n            position: 'absolute',\n            transform: `translate(-50%, -50%) translate(${labelX}px,${labelY}px)`,\n            background: '#ffcc00',\n            padding: 10,\n            borderRadius: 5,\n            fontSize: 12,\n            fontWeight: 700,\n          }}\n          className=\"nodrag nopan\"\n        >\n          {data.label}\n        </div>\n      </EdgeLabelRenderer>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n \nexport default CustomEdge;\nProps\nName\tType\tDefault\n\nchildren\tReactNode\t\nNotes\nThe <EdgeLabelRenderer /> has no pointer events by default.

To allow users to interact with the viewport by panning or zooming the minimap, you can set either of the zoomable or pannable (or both!) props to true.\n\nimport { ReactFlow, MiniMap } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport default function Flow() {\n  return (\n    <ReactFlow nodes={[...]]} edges={[...]]}>\n      <MiniMap pannable zoomable />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\nImplement a custom mini map node\n\nIt is possible to pass a custom component to the nodeComponent prop to change how nodes are rendered in the mini map. If you do this you must use only SVG elements in your component if you want it to work correctly.\n\nimport { ReactFlow, MiniMap } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport default function Flow() {\n  return (\n    <ReactFlow nodes={[...]]} edges={[...]]}>\n      <MiniMap nodeComponent={MiniMapNode} />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n \nfunction MiniMapNode({ x, y }) {\n  return <circle cx={x} cy={y} r=\"50\" />;\n}\n\nCheck out the documentation for MiniMapNodeProps to see what props are passed to your custom component.\n\nCustomising mini map node color\n\nThe nodeColor, nodeStrokeColor, and nodeClassName props can be a function that takes a Node and computes a value for the prop. This can be used to customize the appearance of each mini map node.\n\nThis example shows how to color each mini map node based on the node’s type:\n\nimport { ReactFlow, MiniMap } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport default function Flow() {\n  return (\n    <ReactFlow nodes={[...]]} edges={[...]]}>\n      <MiniMap nodeColor={nodeColor} />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n \nfunction nodeColor(node) {\n  switch (node.type) {\n    case 'input':\n      return '#6ede87';\n    case 'output':\n      return '#6865A5';\n    default:\n      return '#ff0072';\n  }\n}\nTypeScript\n\nThis component accepts a generic type argument of custom node types.

You might pass this directly to the edges prop of your <ReactFlow /> component, or you may want to manipulate it first to perform some layouting, for example.\n\nsetEdges: A function that you can use to update the edges. You can pass it a new array of edges or a callback that receives the current array of edges and returns a new array of edges. This is the same as the second element of the tuple returned by React’s useState hook.\n\nonEdgesChange: A handy callback that can take an array of EdgeChanges and update the edges state accordingly. You’ll typically pass this directly to the onEdgesChange prop of your <ReactFlow /> component.\n\nTypeScript\n\nThis hook accepts a generic type argument of custom edge types. See this section in our TypeScript guide for more information.\n\nconst nodes = useEdgesState<CustomEdgeType>();\nNotes\nThis hook was created to make prototyping easier and our documentation examples clearer.

Components that use this hook will re-render whenever any node changes, including when a node is selected or moved.\n\nRead more \nuseNodesData()\n\nWith this hook you can subscribe to changes of a node data of a specific node.\n\nRead more \nuseNodesInitialized()\n\nThis hook tells you whether all the nodes in a flow have been measured and given a width and height. When you add a node to the flow, this hook will return false and then true again once the node has been measured.\n\nRead more \nuseNodesState()\n\nThis hook makes it easy to prototype a controlled flow where you manage the state of nodes and edges outside the ReactFlowInstance. You can think of it like React's `useState` hook with an additional helper callback.\n\nRead more \nuseOnSelectionChange()\n\nThis hook lets you listen for changes to both node and edge selection. As the name implies, the callback you provide will be called whenever the selection of either nodes or edges changes.\n\nRead more \nuseOnViewportChange()\n\nThe useOnViewportChange hook lets you listen for changes to the viewport such as panning and zooming. You can provide a callback for each phase of a viewport change: onStart, onChange, and onEnd.\n\nRead more \nuseReactFlow()\n\nThis hook returns a ReactFlowInstance that can be used to update nodes and edges, manipulate the viewport, or query the current state of the flow.\n\nRead more \nuseStore()\n\nThis hook can be used to subscribe to internal state changes of the React Flow component. The useStore hook is re-exported from the Zustand state management library, so you should check out their docs for more details.\n\nRead more \nuseStoreApi()\n\nIn some cases, you might need to access the store directly. This hook returns the store object which can be used on demand to access the state or dispatch actions.\n\nRead more \nuseUpdateNodeInternals()\n\nWhen you programmatically add or remove handles to a node or update a node's handle position, you need to let React Flow know about it using this hook. This will update the internal dimensions of the node and properly reposition handles on the canvas if necessary.\n\nRead more \nuseViewport()\n\nThe useViewport hook is a convenient way to read the current state of the Viewport in a component. Components that use this hook will re-render whenever the viewport changes.\n\nRead more \nLast updated on February 4, 2026\n<ViewportPortal />\nuseConnection()\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

See this section in our TypeScript guide for more information.\n\nconst nodes = useNodesState<CustomNodeType>();\nNotes\nThis hook was created to make prototyping easier and our documentation examples clearer. Although it is OK to use this hook in production, in practice you may want to use a more sophisticated state management solution like Zustand instead.\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nuseNodesInitialized()\nuseOnSelectionChange()\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

The useStore hook is re-exported from the Zustand  state management library, so you should check out their docs for more details.\n\nThis hook should only be used if there is no other way to access the internal state. For many of the common use cases, there are dedicated hooks available such as useReactFlow, useViewport, etc.\n\nimport { ReactFlow, useStore } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nconst nodesLengthSelector = (state) =>\n  state.nodes.length || 0;\n \nconst NodesLengthDisplay = () => {\n  const nodesLength = useStore(nodesLengthSelector);\n \n  return <div>The current number of nodes is: {nodesLength}</div>;\n};\n \nfunction Flow() {\n  return (\n    <ReactFlow nodes={[...]}>\n      <NodesLengthDisplay />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n\nThis example computes the number of nodes eagerly. Whenever the number of nodes in the flow changes, the <NodesLengthDisplay /> component will re-render. This is in contrast to the example in the useStoreApi hook that only computes the number of nodes when a button is clicked.\n\nChoosing whether to calculate values on-demand or to subscribe to changes as they happen is a bit of a balancing act. On the one hand, putting too many heavy calculations in an event handler can make your app feel sluggish or unresponsive. On the other hand, computing values eagerly can lead to slow or unnecessary re-renders.\n\nWe make both this hook and useStoreApi available so that you can choose the approach that works best for your use-case.\n\nSignature\nParameters:\nName\tType\tDefault\n\nselector\t(state: ReactFlowState) => StateSlice\n\nA selector function that returns a slice of the flow’s internal state. Extracting or transforming just the state you need is a good practice to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\n\t\n\nequalityFn\t(a: StateSlice, b: StateSlice) => boolean\n\nA function to compare the previous and next value. This is incredibly useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders. Good sensible defaults are using Object.is or importing zustand/shallow, but you can be as granular as you like.\n\n\t\nReturns:\nStateSlice\n\nThe selected state slice.\n\nExamples\nTriggering store actions\n\nYou can manipulate the internal React Flow state by triggering internal actions through the useStore hook. These actions are already used internally throughout the library, but you can also use them to implement custom functionality.\n\nimport { useStore } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nconst setMinZoomSelector = (state) => state.setMinZoom;\n \nfunction MinZoomSetter() {\n  const setMinZoom = useStore(setMinZoomSelector);\n \n  return <button onClick={() => setMinZoom(6)}>set min zoom</button>;\n}\nTypeScript\n\nThis hook can be typed by typing the selector function. See this section in our TypeScript guide for more information.\n\nconst nodes = useStore((s: ReactFlowState<CustomNodeType>) => s.nodes);\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nuseReactFlow()\nuseStoreApi()\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

You can either import the enum and use it like BackgroundVariant.Lines or you can use the raw string value directly.\n\nRead more \nColorMode\n\nThe ColorMode type defines the available color modes for the ReactFlow component.\n\nRead more \nConnection\n\nThe Connection type is the basic minimal description of an Edge between two nodes. The addEdge util can be used to upgrade a Connection to an Edge.\n\nRead more \nConnectionLineComponent\n\nCustom React component for rendering the connection line during edge creation.\n\nRead more \nConnectionLineComponentProps\n\nIf you want to render a custom component for connection lines, you can set the connectionLineComponent prop on the ReactFlow component. The ConnectionLineComponentProps are passed to your custom component.\n\nRead more \nConnectionLineType\n\nIf you set the connectionLineType prop on your ReactFlow component, it will dictate the style of connection line rendered when creating new edges.\n\nRead more \nConnectionMode\n\nSpecifies the rules for how connections between nodes are established.\n\nRead more \nConnectionState\n\nData about an ongoing connection.\n\nRead more \nCoordinateExtent\n\nA coordinate extent represents two points in a coordinate system: one in the top left corner and one in the bottom right corner. It is used to represent the bounds of nodes in the flow or the bounds of the viewport.\n\nRead more \nDefaultEdgeOptions\n\nMany properties on an Edge are optional. When a new edge is created, the properties that are not provided will be filled in with the default values passed to the defaultEdgeOptions prop of the ReactFlow component.\n\nRead more \nDeleteElements\n\nDeleteElements deletes nodes and edges from the flow and return the deleted edges and nodes asynchronously.\n\nRead more \nEdge\n\nWhere a Connection is the minimal description of an edge between two nodes, an `Edge` is the complete description with everything React Flow needs to know in order to render it.\n\nRead more \nEdgeChange\n\nThe onEdgesChange callback takes an array of EdgeChange objects that you should use to update your flow's state. The EdgeChange type is a union of four different object types that represent that various ways an edge can change in a flow.\n\nRead more \nEdgeMarker\n\nEdges can optionally have markers at the start and end of an edge. The EdgeMarker type is used to configure those markers!

If you are looking for guides and tutorials, please refer to our learn section.\n\nHow to use this reference\n\nWe think that documentation should answer two broad questions: “what is this thing?” and “how do I use it?”\n\nTo that end, our API reference aims to concisely answer that first question and learn section goes into more detail on the second. If you find yourself clicking around the reference wondering what the heck any of this means, maybe we have a guide that can help you out!\n\nCustom nodes\n\nA powerful feature of React Flow is the ability to add custom nodes. Within your custom nodes you can render everything you want. You can define multiple source and target handles and render form inputs or charts for example. In this guide we will implement a node with an input field that updates some text in another part of the application.\n\nRead more \n\nLayouting\n\nWe regularly get asked how to handle layouting in React Flow. While we could build some basic layouting into React Flow, we believe that you know your app's requirements best and with so many options out there we think it's better you choose the best right tool for the job. In this guide we'll look at four layouting libraries and how to use them.\n\nRead more \nA note for our long-term users\n\nIf you’re coming here from our old API pages things might look a bit different! We’ve reorganized our documentation to make it easier to look things up if you know what you’re looking for. All our types, components, hooks, and util functions get their own page now to help you find exactly what you need.\n\nIf you’re new to React Flow or you’re not sure where to look for something, take a look at the section below.\n\nA note for JavaScript users\n\nReact Flow is written in TypeScript, but we know that not everyone uses it. We encourage developers to use the technology that works best for them, and throughout our documentation there is a blend of TypeScript and JavaScript examples.\n\nFor our API reference, however, we use TypeScript’s syntax to document the types of props and functions. Here’s a quick crash course on how to read it:\n\n• ? means that the field or argument is optional.\n\n• <T> in a type definition represents a generic type parameter. Like a function argument but for types! The definition type Array<T> = ... means a type called Array that takes a generic type parameter T.\n\n• <T> when referring to a type is like “filling in” a generic type parameter. It’s like calling a function but for types! The type Array<number> is the type Array with the generic type parameter T filled in with the type number.\n\n• T | U means that the type is either T or U: this is often called a union.\n\n• T & U means that the type is both T and U: this is often called an intersection.\n\nThe TypeScript folks have their own handy guide for reading types  that you might find useful. If you’re still stuck on something, feel free to drop by our Discord  and ask for help!\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\n<ReactFlow />\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

In other words, if we have three nodes connected in sequence - a->b->c - and we deleted the middle node b, this example shows you how to end up with the graph a->c.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to make use of a few bits:\n\nThe onNodesDelete callback lets us know when a node is deleted.\ngetConnectedEdges gives us all the edges connected to a node, either as source or target.\ngetIncomers and getOutgoers give us the nodes connected to a node as source or target.\n\nAll together, this allows us to take all the nodes connected to the deleted node, and reconnect them to any nodes the deleted node was connected to.\n\nApp.jsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  Background,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n  addEdge,\n  getIncomers,\n  getOutgoers,\n  getConnectedEdges,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    type: 'input',\n    data: { label: 'Start here...' },\n    position: { x: -150, y: 0 },\n  },\n  {\n    id: '2',\n    type: 'input',\n    data: { label: '...or here!' },\n    position: { x: 150, y: 0 },\n  },\n  { id: '3', data: { label: 'Delete me.' }, position: { x: 0, y: 100 } },\n  { id: '4', data: { label: 'Then me!' }, position: { x: 0, y: 200 } },\n  {\n    id: '5',\n    type: 'output',\n    data: { label: 'End here!' },\n    position: { x: 0, y: 300 },\n  },\n];\n \nconst initialEdges = [\n  { id: '1->3', source: '1', target: '3' },\n  { id: '2->3', source: '2', target: '3' },\n  { id: '3->4', source: '3', target: '4' },\n  { id: '4->5', source: '4', target: '5' },\n];\n \nexport default function Flow() {\n  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);\n \n  const onConnect = useCallback((params) => setEdges(addEdge(params, edges)), [edges]);\n \n  const onNodesDelete = useCallback(\n    (deleted) => {\n      let remainingNodes = [...nodes];\n      setEdges(\n        deleted.reduce((acc, node) => {\n          const incomers = getIncomers(node, remainingNodes, acc);\n          const outgoers = getOutgoers(node, remainingNodes, acc);\n          const connectedEdges = getConnectedEdges([node], acc);\n \n          const remainingEdges = acc.filter((edge) => !connectedEdges.includes(edge));\n \n          const createdEdges = incomers.flatMap(({ id: source }) =>\n            outgoers.map(({ id: target }) => ({\n              id: `${source}->${target}`,\n              source,\n              target,\n            })),\n          );\n \n          remainingNodes = remainingNodes.filter((rn) => rn.id !== node.id);\n \n          return [...remainingEdges, ...createdEdges];\n        }, edges),\n      );\n    },\n    [nodes, edges],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={nodes}\n      edges={edges}\n      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n      onNodesDelete={onNodesDelete}\n      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n      onConnect={onConnect}\n      fitView\n      attributionPosition=\"top-right\"\n    >\n      <Background />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n}\n\nAlthough this example is less than 20 lines of code there’s quite a lot to digest. Let’s break some of it down:\n\nOur onNodesDelete callback is called with one argument - deleted - that is an array of every node that was just deleted. If you select an individual node and press the delete key, deleted will contain just that node, but if you make a selection all the nodes in that selection will be in deleted.\n\nWe create a new array of edges - remainingEdges - that contains all the edges in the flow that have nothing to do with the node(s) we just deleted.\n\nWe create another array of edges by flatMapping over the array of incomers. These are nodes that were connected to the deleted node as a source. For each of these nodes, we create a new edge that connects to each node in the array of outgoers. These are nodes that were connected to the deleted node as a target.\n\nFor brevity, we’re using object destructuring while at the same time renaming the variable bound (e.g. ({ id: source }) => ...) destructures the id property of the object and binds it to a new variable called source) but you don’t need to do this\n\nQuick Reference\ngetConnectedEdges\ngetIncomers\nArray.prototype.flatMap\nDestructuring assignment\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nCustom Node\nDrag Handle\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Below are a collection of examples showing different ways an edge path might be used in\n\nAnimating SVG elements\n\nIt is possible to animate an SVG element along a path using the <animateMotion /> element. This example creates a custom edge that animates a circle along the edge path.\n\nAnimatedSVGEdge.tsx\nApp.tsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nindex.tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { BaseEdge, getSmoothStepPath, type EdgeProps } from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport function AnimatedSVGEdge({\n  id,\n  sourceX,\n  sourceY,\n  targetX,\n  targetY,\n  sourcePosition,\n  targetPosition,\n}: EdgeProps) {\n  const [edgePath] = getSmoothStepPath({\n    sourceX,\n    sourceY,\n    sourcePosition,\n    targetX,\n    targetY,\n    targetPosition,\n  });\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <BaseEdge id={id} path={edgePath} />\n      <circle r=\"10\" fill=\"#ff0073\">\n        <animateMotion dur=\"2s\" repeatCount=\"indefinite\" path={edgePath} />\n      </circle>\n    </>\n  );\n}\nAnimating other nodes\n\nIf you want to animate more than SVG along an edge, you can do that with the Web Animations API. This example demonstrates how to animate another node in the flow along an edge path by using the offsetPath property and animating the offsetDistance property.\n\nAnimatedNodeEdge.tsx\nApp.tsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nindex.tsx\nimport { useEffect, useMemo } from 'react';\nimport {\n  BaseEdge,\n  getBezierPath,\n  useReactFlow,\n  type Edge,\n  type EdgeProps,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nexport type AnimatedNodeEdge = Edge<{ node: string }, 'animatedNode'>;\n \nexport function AnimatedNodeEdge({\n  id,\n  data = { node: '' },\n  sourceX,\n  sourceY,\n  targetX,\n  targetY,\n  sourcePosition,\n  targetPosition,\n}: EdgeProps<AnimatedNodeEdge>) {\n  const { getNode, updateNode } = useReactFlow();\n  const [edgePath] = getBezierPath({\n    sourceX,\n    sourceY,\n    sourcePosition,\n    targetX,\n    targetY,\n    targetPosition,\n  });\n  const selector = useMemo(\n    () => `.react-flow__node[data-id=\"${data.node}\"]`,\n    [data.node],\n  );\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const node = document.querySelector(selector) as HTMLElement;\n \n    if (!node) return;\n \n    node.style.offsetPath = `path('${edgePath}')`;\n    node.style.offsetRotate = '0deg';\n    // This property is fairly new and not all versions of TypeScript have it\n    // in the lib.dom.d.ts file. If you get an error here, you can either\n    // ignore it or add the property to the CSSStyleDeclaration interface\n    // yourself.\n    //\n    // @ts-expect-error\n    node.style.offsetAnchor = 'center';\n \n    let wasDraggable = getNode(data.node).draggable;\n \n    updateNode(data.node, { draggable: false });\n \n    return () => {\n      node.style.offsetPath = 'none';\n      updateNode(data.node, { draggable: wasDraggable });\n    };\n  }, [selector, edgePath]);\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const node = document.querySelector(selector) as HTMLElement;\n \n    if (!node) return;\n \n    const keyframes = [{ offsetDistance: '0%' }, { offsetDistance: '100%' }];\n    const animation = node.animate(keyframes, {\n      duration: 2000,\n      direction: 'alternate',\n      iterations: Infinity,\n    });\n \n    return () => {\n      animation.cancel();\n    };\n  }, [selector]);\n \n  return <BaseEdge id={id} path={edgePath} />;\n}\n\nThere are some important details in this example to take note of:\n\nThe animated node has its draggable property set to false while the animation is running. This prevents a user moving the node around and breaking the animation path.\n\nThe animation path and the animation itself are set up in separate useEffect hooks. This lets the animation continue playing smoothly even if the edge path is recalculated (for example when the source or target nodes are dragged.)\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nShapes\nCustom Connection Line\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

It’s possible to add your own SVG markers , too.\n\nThe markers are defined as SVG elements, so you can use any SVG you want. The React Flow edge renderer will expect the marker definition to be in a <defs> element.\n\nIf, for example, your custom edge is wrapping a built-in <BaseEdge/> component, you can pass the markerStart and markerEnd props to the <BaseEdge/> component. The built-in React Flow edge components will expect the markerStart and markerEnd props to be in the format \"url(#markerId)\", where markerId is the ID of your marker definition.\n\nThis allows you to customize the marker for a specific edge, depending on the state of the edge.\n\nApp.tsx\nCustomEdge.tsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nindex.tsx\nimport { ReactFlow, Background, MarkerType, BezierEdge

Edges are the connections between nodes, but what if we want to create an edge that is only connected to one node? What about an “edge” not connected to any nodes at all?\n\nThis example shows how to create an “incomplete” edge when a user releases a connection line without making a connection. A ghost node is rendered where the connection line was released, and a temporary edge is added to the flow. Making use of editable edges, the user can pick the edge back up and complete the connection at which point the ghost node is removed!\n\nInstead of connecting A directly to B in the flow, try releasing the connection line in an empty space to create a temporary edge!\n\nApp.jsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nuseIncompleteEdge.jsx\nimport {\n  Background,\n  ReactFlow,\n  ReactFlowProvider,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport { GhostNode, useIncompleteEdge } from './useIncompleteEdge';\n \nconst nodeTypes = {\n  ghost: GhostNode,\n};\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  { id: '0', type: 'input', data: { label: 'A' }, position: { x: 0, y: -100 } },\n  { id: '1', type: 'output', data: { label: 'B' }, position: { x: 0, y: 100 } },\n];\n \nconst IncompleteEdge = () => {\n  const [nodes, , onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState([]);\n \n  const handlers = useIncompleteEdge();\n \n  return (\n    <ReactFlow\n      nodes={nodes}\n      nodeTypes={nodeTypes}\n      edges={edges}\n      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n      fitView\n      {...handlers}\n    >\n      <Background />\n    </ReactFlow>\n  );\n};\n \nexport default () => (\n  <ReactFlowProvider>\n    <IncompleteEdge />\n  </ReactFlowProvider>\n);\n\nWe’ve defined a useIncompleteEdge hook that encapsulates the logic for creating and managing a “ghost node”. It returns a number of event handlers intended to be passed to the <ReactFlow /> component.\n\nonConnect is called when a complete connection is made.\n\nonConnectEnd is called when the user releases a connection line. The second connectionState param can be used to determine if the connection was successful or not and where it started (and ended if the connection is valid). This callback creates a ghost node and a temporary edge from the connectionState.fromNode.id to that ghost node. The temporary edge is marked as reconnectable so that the user can pick it back up and complete the connection.\n\nonReconnect is called when a complete reconnection is made.\n\nonReconnectEnd is called when the user releases a reconnection line. This callback removes the ghost node and temporary edge. A new one may be added back when onConnectEnd is called.\n\nThis example is an adaptation of our add node on edge drop example!\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nSimple Floating Edges\nEditable Edge\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

The drag and drop behavior outside of the React Flow pane is not built in but can be implemented with the native HTML Drag and Drop API , Pointer Events , or a third party library like react-draggable .\n\nDrag and Drop with HTML Drag and Drop API\n\nThe HTML Drag and Drop API is a native API that is supported by all major browsers. It is a simple API that allows you to drag and drop elements between different elements on the page.\n\nNote: HTML Drag and Drop API is not properly supported on touch devices. See the example below for an alternative approach using pointer events.\n\nApp.jsx\nDnDContext.jsx\nSidebar.jsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nimport React, { useRef, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  ReactFlowProvider,\n  addEdge,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n  Controls,\n  useReactFlow,\n  Background,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport Sidebar from './Sidebar';\nimport { DnDProvider, useDnD } from './DnDContext';\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    type: 'input',\n    data: { label: 'input node' },\n    position: { x: 250, y: 5 },\n  },\n];\n \nlet id = 0;\nconst getId = () => `dndnode_${id++}`;\n \nconst DnDFlow = () => {\n  const reactFlowWrapper = useRef(null);\n  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState([]);\n  const { screenToFlowPosition } = useReactFlow();\n  const [type] = useDnD();\n \n  const onConnect = useCallback((params) => setEdges((eds) => addEdge(params, eds)), []);\n \n  const onDragOver = useCallback((event) => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    event.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'move';\n  }, []);\n \n  const onDrop = useCallback(\n    (event) => {\n      event.preventDefault();\n \n      // check if the dropped element is valid\n      if (!type) {\n        return;\n      }\n \n      // project was renamed to screenToFlowPosition\n      // and you don't need to subtract the reactFlowBounds.left/top anymore\n      // details: https://reactflow.dev/whats-new/2023-11-10\n      const position = screenToFlowPosition({\n        x: event.clientX,\n        y: event.clientY,\n      });\n      const newNode = {\n        id: getId(),\n        type,\n        position,\n        data: { label: `${type} node` },\n      };\n \n      setNodes((nds) => nds.concat(newNode));\n    },\n    [screenToFlowPosition, type],\n  );\n \n  const onDragStart = (event, nodeType) => {\n    setType(nodeType);\n    event.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', nodeType);\n    event.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = 'move';\n  };\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"dndflow\">\n      <div className=\"reactflow-wrapper\" ref={reactFlowWrapper}>\n        <ReactFlow\n          nodes={nodes}\n          edges={edges}\n          onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n          onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n          onConnect={onConnect}\n          onDrop={onDrop}\n          onDragStart={onDragStart}\n          onDragOver={onDragOver}\n          fitView\n        >\n          <Controls />\n          <Background />\n        </ReactFlow>\n      </div>\n      <Sidebar />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n \nexport default () => (\n  <ReactFlowProvider>\n    <DnDProvider>\n      <DnDFlow />\n    </DnDProvider>\n  </ReactFlowProvider>\n);\nDrag and Drop with Pointer Events\n\nAnother way to implement drag and drop is to use pointer events.\n\nThe Pointer Events API is a modern API that is supported by all major browsers. It is slightly more complex to implement than the HTML Drag and Drop API, but by using pointer events we can make sure that the drag and drop behavior is consistent across all devices, both mouse and touch.\n\nApp.tsx\nSidebar.tsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nindex.tsx\nuseDnD.tsx\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  Background,\n  Connection,\n  Controls,\n  ReactFlow,\n  ReactFlowProvider,\n  addEdge,\n  useEdgesState,\n  useNodesState,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport { Sidebar } from './Sidebar';\nimport { DnDProvider } from './useDnD';\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    type: 'input',\n    data: { label: 'input node' },\n    position: { x: 250, y: 5 },\n  },\n];\n \nfunction DnDFlow() {\n  const [nodes, _, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState([]);\n \n  const onConnect = useCallback(\n    (params: Connection) => setEdges((eds) => addEdge(params, eds)),\n    [],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"dndflow\">\n      <div className=\"reactflow-wrapper\">\n        <ReactFlow\n          nodes={nodes}\n          edges={edges}\n          onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n          onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n          onConnect={onConnect}\n          fitView\n        >\n          <Controls />\n          <Background />\n        </ReactFlow>\n      </div>\n      <Sidebar />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default () => (\n  <ReactFlowProvider>\n    <DnDProvider>\n      <DnDFlow />\n    </DnDProvider>\n  </ReactFlowProvider>\n);\nDrag and Drop with Neodrag\n\nNeodrag  is a library that provides a simple and easy to use drag and drop API. In a real-world application, you may want to use the Neodrag library to handle the drag and drop behavior in a cross-platform compatible way, compatible with both mouse and touch devices.\n\nApp.tsx\nSidebar.tsx\nxy-theme.css\nindex.css\nindex.tsx\nutils.ts\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport {\n  Background,\n  Connection,\n  Controls,\n  ReactFlow,\n  ReactFlowProvider,\n  addEdge,\n  useEdgesState,\n  useNodesState,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\n \nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\n \nimport { Sidebar } from './Sidebar';\n \nconst initialNodes = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    type: 'input',\n    data: { label: 'input node' },\n    position: { x: 250, y: 5 },\n  },\n];\n \nfunction DnDFlow() {\n  const [nodes, _, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState([]);\n \n  const onConnect = useCallback(\n    (params: Connection) => setEdges((eds) => addEdge(params, eds)),\n    [],\n  );\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"dndflow\">\n      <div className=\"reactflow-wrapper\">\n        <ReactFlow\n          nodes={nodes}\n          edges={edges}\n          onNodesChange={onNodesChange}\n          onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}\n          onConnect={onConnect}\n          fitView\n        >\n          <Controls />\n          <Background />\n        </ReactFlow>\n      </div>\n      <Sidebar />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n \nexport default () => (\n  <ReactFlowProvider>\n    <DnDFlow />\n  </ReactFlowProvider>\n);\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nContextual Zoom\nPrevent Cycles\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Key features include:\n\nNode creation: Instead of manually placing or connecting nodes, users click on placeholder elements to add new nodes\nMultiple interaction points: Add children by clicking on nodes, convert placeholders into nodes, or insert nodes between existing ones using the ”+” button on edges\nSmart layout algorithm: When the graph changes, an auto-layout hook powered by d3-hierarchy recalculates all positions\nSmooth transitions: Nodes animate to their new positions, maintaining visual clarity even as complexity increases\n\nThis is a Pro example.

It’s made up of two parts:\n\nThe Eraser component that handles the erasing logic and rendering of the eraser trail.\nThe custom ErasableNode and ErasableEdge that reacts to the toBeDeleted flag.\n\nDetermining if the trail intersects with a node is fairly straight forward - however detecting intersections between the trail and an edge is a bit more complex: We sample points along the edge through the getPointAtLength method of the SVG path element, construct a polyline that we can then use to detect intersections with the eraser trail.

Useful for new projects, MVPs, or when you need to get up and running quickly.\n\nNote\n\nReact Flow UI has been updated to support the latest version of shadcn/ui, on React 19 and Tailwind 4! Read more about the changes and how to upgrade here.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou need to have shadcn and tailwind configured in your project. If you haven’t installed it, you can follow the steps explained in the shadcn installation guide . If shadcn and tailwind are part of your project, you can initialize shadcn-ui by running:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n\nIf you want to learn more about the motivation behind this project, you can find a detailed blog post here . For a more in-depth tutorial, we also recently published a new guide on getting started with React Flow UI.\n\nImportant\n\nUsing React Flow UI components requires importing the main React Flow CSS stylesheet before you import the shadcn UI stylesheet. You usually do so in the Typescript or Javascript file where you use the main <ReactFlow> component.\n\nApp.tsx\nimport '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';\nUsage\n\nFind a component you like and run the command to add it to your project.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name\n\nThis command copies the component code inside your components folder. You can change this folder by adding an alias inside your components.json.\n\nIt automatically installs all necessary dependencies\n\nIt utilizes previously added and even modified components or asks you if you’d like to overwrite them.\n\nIt uses your existing tailwind configuration.\n\nThe components are not black-boxes and can be modified and extended to fit your needs.\n\nFor more information visit the shadcn documentation .\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nAI Workflow Editor\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

All of the React Flow components are based on shadcn UI , and you should follow the shadcn UI theming guide  to customize aspects like typography and colors in your application.\n\nIn most occasions though, when developing custom nodes, you may simply need to add custom Tailwind CSS classes. All of the BaseNode components are just light wrappers around <div>.\n\nFor example, to change the border color of a node, based on an hypothetical execution status, you can pass extra classNames:\n\n// Assuming your component is receiving a `data` prop\nexport const BaseNodeSimpleDemo = memo(({ data }: NodeProps) => {\n  return (\n    <BaseNode\n      className={cn('w-[350px] p-0 hover:ring-orange-500', {\n        'border-orange-500': data.status === 'loading',\n        'border-red-500': data.status === 'error',\n      })}\n    >\n      {/* Your custom node definiton goes here */}\n    </BaseNode>\n  );\n});\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nWorkflow Editor\nStatus Indicator\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.

Each shape should be a React component that takes one prop, animateMotionProps, and returns some SVG.\n\nYou can define these shapes in a separate file or in the same file as the edge component. In order to use them, you need to add them to the shapes record like so:\n\nconst shapes = {\n  box: ({ animateMotionProps }) => (\n    <rect width=\"5\" height=\"5\" fill=\"#ff0073\">\n      <animateMotion {...animateMotionProps} />\n    </rect>\n  ),\n} satisfies Record<string, AnimatedSvg>;\n\nThe keys of the shapes record are valid values for the shape field of the edge’s data:\n\nconst initialEdges = [\n  {\n    // ...\n    type: \"animatedSvgEdge\",\n    data: {\n      duration: 2,\n      shape: \"box\",\n    },\n  } satisfies AnimatedSvgEdge,\n];\n\nIf you want to render regular HTML elements, be sure to wrap them in an SVG <foreignObject /> element. Make sure to give the <foreignObject /> an id attribute and use that as the href attribute when rendering the <animateMotion /> element.\n\nLast updated on February 4, 2026\nEdge with Node Data\nNode Search\n\nA project by the xyflow team\n\nWe are building and maintaining open source software for node-based UIs since 2019.\n\nDocs\n\nGetting Started\nAPI Reference\nExamples\nComponents\nShowcase\nPlayground\n\nSocial\n\nDiscord\nGithub\nX / Twitter\nBluesky\n\nxyflow\n\nBlog\nOpen Source\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n\nLegal\n\nMIT License\nCode of Conduct\nImprint\n\ninfo@xyflow.com — Copyright © 2026 webkid GmbH.
