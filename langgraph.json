Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with models and tools.\nWe will commonly use LangChain components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don’t need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain’s agents that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.\nLangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.\n�\n Install\npip\nuv\nCopy\npip install -U langgraph\n\nThen, create a simple hello world example:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END\n\ndef mock_llm(state: MessagesState):\n    return {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"ai\", \"content\": \"hello world\"}]}\n\ngraph = StateGraph(MessagesState)\ngraph.add_node(mock_llm)\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"mock_llm\")\ngraph.add_edge(\"mock_llm\", END)\ngraph = graph.compile()\n\ngraph.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hi!\"}]})\n\n�\nCore benefits\nLangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for any long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:\nDurable execution: Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.\nHuman-in-the-loop: Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.\nComprehensive memory: Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.\nDebugging with LangSmith: Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.\nProduction-ready deployment: Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.\n�\nLangGraph ecosystem\nWhile LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:\nLangSmith\nTrace requests, evaluate outputs, and monitor deployments in one place. Prototype locally with LangGraph, then move to production with integrated observability and evaluation to build more reliable agent systems.\nLearn more\nLangSmith Agent Server\nDeploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in Studio.\nLearn more\nLangChain\nProvides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development. Contains agent abstractions built on top of LangGraph.\nLearn more\n�\nAcknowledgements\nLangGraph is inspired by Pregel and Apache Beam. The public interface draws inspiration from NetworkX. LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

Define tools and model\n2. Define state\n3. Define model node\n4. Define tool node\n5. Define end logic\n6. Build and compile the agent\nGet started\nQuickstart\nCopy page\nThis quickstart demonstrates how to build a calculator agent using the LangGraph Graph API or the Functional API.\nUse the Graph API if you prefer to define your agent as a graph of nodes and edges.\nUse the Functional API if you prefer to define your agent as a single function.\nFor conceptual information, see Graph API overview and Functional API overview.\nFor this example, you will need to set up a Claude (Anthropic) account and get an API key. Then, set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable in your terminal.\nUse the Graph API\nUse the Functional API\n�\n1. Define tools and model\nIn this example, we’ll use the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model and define tools for addition, multiplication, and division.\nCopy\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\n\n\nmodel = init_chat_model(\n    \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\n    temperature=0\n)\n\n\n# Define tools\n@tool\ndef multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Multiply `a` and `b`.\n\n    Args:\n        a: First int\n        b: Second int\n    \"\"\"\n    return a * b\n\n\n@tool\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Adds `a` and `b`.\n\n    Args:\n        a: First int\n        b: Second int\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\n\n@tool\ndef divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Divide `a` and `b`.\n\n    Args:\n        a: First int\n        b: Second int\n    \"\"\"\n    return a / b\n\n\n# Augment the LLM with tools\ntools = [add, multiply, divide]\ntools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}\nmodel_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools)\n\n�\n2. Define state\nThe graph’s state is used to store the messages and the number of LLM calls.\nState in LangGraph persists throughout the agent’s execution.\nThe Annotated type with operator.add ensures that new messages are appended to the existing list rather than replacing it.\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import AnyMessage\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict, Annotated\nimport operator\n\n\nclass MessagesState(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], operator.add]\n    llm_calls: int\n\n�\n3. Define model node\nThe model node is used to call the LLM and decide whether to call a tool or not.\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import SystemMessage\n\n\ndef llm_call(state: dict):\n    \"\"\"LLM decides whether to call a tool or not\"\"\"\n\n    return {\n        \"messages\": [\n            model_with_tools.invoke(\n                [\n                    SystemMessage(\n                        content=\"You are a helpful assistant tasked with performing arithmetic on a set of inputs.\"\n                    )\n                ]\n                + state[\"messages\"]\n            )\n        ],\n        \"llm_calls\": state.get('llm_calls', 0) + 1\n    }\n\n�\n4. Define tool node\nThe tool node is used to call the tools and return the results.\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import ToolMessage\n\n\ndef tool_node(state: dict):\n    \"\"\"Performs the tool call\"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n    for tool_call in state[\"messages\"][-1].tool_calls:\n        tool = tools_by_name[tool_call[\"name\"]]\n        observation = tool.invoke(tool_call[\"args\"])\n        result.append(ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call[\"id\"]))\n    return {\"messages\": result}\n\n�\n5. Define end logic\nThe conditional edge function is used to route to the tool node or end based upon whether the LLM made a tool call.\nCopy\nfrom typing import Literal\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n\n\ndef should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal[\"tool_node\", END]:\n    \"\"\"Decide if we should continue the loop or stop based upon whether the LLM made a tool call\"\"\"\n\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    last_message = messages[-1]\n\n    # If the LLM makes a tool call, then perform an action\n    if last_message.tool_calls:\n        return \"tool_node\"\n\n    # Otherwise, we stop (reply to the user)\n    return END\n\n�\n6. Build and compile the agent\nThe agent is built using the StateGraph class and compiled using the compile method.\nCopy\n# Build workflow\nagent_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)\n\n# Add nodes\nagent_builder.add_node(\"llm_call\", llm_call)\nagent_builder.add_node(\"tool_node\", tool_node)\n\n# Add edges to connect nodes\nagent_builder.add_edge(START, \"llm_call\")\nagent_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"llm_call\",\n    should_continue,\n    [\"tool_node\", END]\n)\nagent_builder.add_edge(\"tool_node\", \"llm_call\")\n\n# Compile the agent\nagent = agent_builder.compile()\n\n# Show the agent\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\ndisplay(Image(agent.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))\n\n# Invoke\nfrom langchain.messages import HumanMessage\nmessages = [HumanMessage(content=\"Add 3 and 4.\")]\nmessages = agent.invoke({\"messages\": messages})\nfor m in messages[\"messages\"]:\n    m.pretty_print()\n\nTo learn how to trace your agent with LangSmith, see the LangSmith documentation.\nCongratulations! You’ve built your first agent using the LangGraph Graph API.\n\nFull code example\n\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

Then, you will describe the different decisions and transitions from each of your nodes. Finally, you connect nodes together through a shared state that each node can read from and write to.\nIn this walkthrough, we’ll guide you through the thought process of building a customer support email agent with LangGraph.\n�\nStart with the process you want to automate\nImagine that you need to build an AI agent that handles customer support emails. Your product team has given you these requirements:\nCopy\nThe agent should:\n\n- Read incoming customer emails\n- Classify them by urgency and topic\n- Search relevant documentation to answer questions\n- Draft appropriate responses\n- Escalate complex issues to human agents\n- Schedule follow-ups when needed\n\nExample scenarios to handle:\n\n1. Simple product question: \"How do I reset my password?\"\n2. Bug report: \"The export feature crashes when I select PDF format\"\n3. Urgent billing issue: \"I was charged twice for my subscription!\"\n4. Feature request: \"Can you add dark mode to the mobile app?\"\n5. Complex technical issue: \"Our API integration fails intermittently with 504 errors\"\n\nTo implement an agent in LangGraph, you will usually follow the same five steps.\n�\nStep 1: Map out your workflow as discrete steps\nStart by identifying the distinct steps in your process. Each step will become a node (a function that does one specific thing). Then, sketch how these steps connect to each other.\n\nSTART\n\nRead Email\n\nClassify Intent\n\nDoc Search\n\nBug Track\n\nHuman Review\n\nDraft Reply\n\nHuman Review\n\nSend Reply\n\nEND\n\nThe arrows in this diagram show possible paths, but the actual decision of which path to take happens inside each node.\nNow that we’ve identified the components in our workflow, let’s understand what each node needs to do:\nRead Email: Extract and parse the email content\nClassify Intent: Use an LLM to categorize urgency and topic, then route to appropriate action\nDoc Search: Query your knowledge base for relevant information\nBug Track: Create or update issue in tracking system\nDraft Reply: Generate an appropriate response\nHuman Review: Escalate to human agent for approval or handling\nSend Reply: Dispatch the email response\nNotice that some nodes make decisions about where to go next (Classify Intent, Draft Reply, Human Review), while others always proceed to the same next step (Read Email always goes to Classify Intent, Doc Search always goes to Draft Reply).\n�\nStep 2: Identify what each step needs to do\nFor each node in your graph, determine what type of operation it represents and what context it needs to work properly.\nLLM steps\nUse when you need to understand, analyze, generate text, or make reasoning decisions\nData steps\nUse when you need to retrieve information from external sources\nAction steps\nUse when you need to perform external actions\nUser input steps\nUse when you need human intervention\n�\nLLM steps\nWhen a step needs to understand, analyze, generate text, or make reasoning decisions:\n\nClassify intent\n\nDraft reply\n\n�\nData steps\nWhen a step needs to retrieve information from external sources:\n\nDocument search\n\nCustomer history lookup\n\n�\nAction steps\nWhen a step needs to perform an external action:\n\nSend reply\n\nBug track\n\n�\nUser input steps\nWhen a step needs human intervention:\n\nHuman review node\n\n�\nStep 3: Design your state\nState is the shared memory accessible to all nodes in your agent. Think of it as the notebook your agent uses to keep track of everything it learns and decides as it works through the process.\n�\nWhat belongs in state?\nAsk yourself these questions about each piece of data:\nInclude in state\nDoes it need to persist across steps? If yes, it goes in state.\nDon't store\nCan you derive it from other data? If yes, compute it when needed instead of storing it in state.\nFor our email agent, we need to track:\nThe original email and sender info (can’t reconstruct these later)\nClassification results (needed by multiple later/downstream nodes)\nSearch results and customer data (expensive to re-fetch)\nThe draft response (needs to persist through review)\nExecution metadata (for debugging and recovery)\n�\nKeep state raw, format prompts on-demand\nA key principle: your state should store raw data, not formatted text. Format prompts inside nodes when you need them.\nThis separation means:\nDifferent nodes can format the same data differently for their needs\nYou can change prompt templates without modifying your state schema\nDebugging is clearer – you see exactly what data each node received\nYour agent can evolve without breaking existing state\nLet’s define our state:\nCopy\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Literal\n\n# Define the structure for email classification\nclass EmailClassification(TypedDict):\n    intent: Literal[\"question\", \"bug\", \"billing\", \"feature\", \"complex\"]\n    urgency: Literal[\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", \"critical\"]\n    topic: str\n    summary: str\n\nclass EmailAgentState(TypedDict):\n    # Raw email data\n    email_content: str\n    sender_email: str\n    email_id: str\n\n    # Classification result\n    classification: EmailClassification | None\n\n    # Raw search/API results\n    search_results: list[str] | None  # List of raw document chunks\n    customer_history: dict | None  # Raw customer data from CRM\n\n    # Generated content\n    draft_response: str | None\n    messages: list[str] | None\n\nNotice that the state contains only raw data – no prompt templates, no formatted strings, no instructions. The classification output is stored as a single dictionary, straight from the LLM.\n�\nStep 4: Build your nodes\nNow we implement each step as a function. A node in LangGraph is just a Python function that takes the current state and returns updates to it.\n�\nHandle errors appropriately\nDifferent errors need different handling strategies:\nError Type\tWho Fixes It\tStrategy\tWhen to Use\nTransient errors (network issues, rate limits)\tSystem (automatic)\tRetry policy\tTemporary failures that usually resolve on retry\nLLM-recoverable errors (tool failures, parsing issues)\tLLM\tStore error in state and loop back\tLLM can see the error and adjust its approach\nUser-fixable errors (missing information, unclear instructions)\tHuman\tPause with interrupt()\tNeed user input to proceed\nUnexpected errors\tDeveloper\tLet them bubble up\tUnknown issues that need debugging\nTransient errors\nLLM-recoverable\nUser-fixable\nUnexpected\nAdd a retry policy to automatically retry network issues and rate limits:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.types import RetryPolicy\n\nworkflow.add_node(\n    \"search_documentation\",\n    search_documentation,\n    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=3, initial_interval=1.0)\n)\n\n�\nImplementing our email agent nodes\nWe’ll implement each node as a simple function. Remember: nodes take state, do work, and return updates.\n\nRead and classify nodes\n\nSearch and tracking nodes\n\nResponse nodes\n\n�\nStep 5: Wire it together\nNow we connect our nodes into a working graph. Since our nodes handle their own routing decisions, we only need a few essential edges.\nTo enable human-in-the-loop with interrupt(), we need to compile with a checkpointer to save state between runs:\n\nGraph compilation code\n\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.types import RetryPolicy\n\n# Create the graph\nworkflow = StateGraph(EmailAgentState)\n\n# Add nodes with appropriate error handling\nworkflow.add_node(\"read_email\", read_email)\nworkflow.add_node(\"classify_intent\", classify_intent)\n\n# Add retry policy for nodes that might have transient failures\nworkflow.add_node(\n    \"search_documentation\",\n    search_documentation,\n    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=3)\n)\nworkflow.add_node(\"bug_tracking\", bug_tracking)\nworkflow.add_node(\"draft_response\", draft_response)\nworkflow.add_node(\"human_review\", human_review)\nworkflow.add_node(\"send_reply\", send_reply)\n\n# Add only the essential edges\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"read_email\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"read_email\", \"classify_intent\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"send_reply\", END)\n\n# Compile with checkpointer for persistence, in case run graph with Local_Server --> Please compile without checkpointer\nmemory = MemorySaver()\napp = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n\nThe graph structure is minimal because routing happens inside nodes through Command objects. Each node declares where it can go using type hints like Command[Literal[\"node1\", \"node2\"]], making the flow explicit and traceable.\n�\nTry out your agent\nLet’s run our agent with an urgent billing issue that needs human review:\n\nTesting the agent\n\nThe graph pauses when it hits interrupt(), saves everything to the checkpointer, and waits. It can resume days later, picking up exactly where it left off. The thread_id ensures all state for this conversation is preserved together.\n�\nSummary and next steps\n�\nKey Insights\nBuilding this email agent has shown us the LangGraph way of thinking:\nBreak into discrete steps\nEach node does one thing well. This decomposition enables streaming progress updates, durable execution that can pause and resume, and clear debugging since you can inspect state between steps.\nState is shared memory\nStore raw data, not formatted text. This lets different nodes use the same information in different ways.\nNodes are functions\nThey take state, do work, and return updates. When they need to make routing decisions, they specify both the state updates and the next destination.\nErrors are part of the flow\nTransient failures get retries, LLM-recoverable errors loop back with context, user-fixable problems pause for input, and unexpected errors bubble up for debugging.\nHuman input is first-class\nThe interrupt() function pauses execution indefinitely, saves all state, and resumes exactly where it left off when you provide input. When combined with other operations in a node, it must come first.\nGraph structure emerges naturally\nYou define the essential connections, and your nodes handle their own routing logic. This keeps control flow explicit and traceable - you can always understand what your agent will do next by looking at the current node.\n�\nAdvanced considerations\n\nNode granularity trade-offs\n\n�\nWhere to go from here\nThis was an introduction to thinking about building agents with LangGraph.

This is particularly useful in scenarios that require human-in-the-loop, where users can inspect, validate, or modify the process before continuing, and in long-running tasks that might encounter interruptions or errors (e.g., calls to an LLM timing out). By preserving completed work, durable execution enables a process to resume without reprocessing previous steps — even after a significant delay (e.g., a week later).\nLangGraph’s built-in persistence layer provides durable execution for workflows, ensuring that the state of each execution step is saved to a durable store. This capability guarantees that if a workflow is interrupted — whether by a system failure or for human-in-the-loop interactions — it can be resumed from its last recorded state.\nIf you are using LangGraph with a checkpointer, you already have durable execution enabled. You can pause and resume workflows at any point, even after interruptions or failures. To make the most of durable execution, ensure that your workflow is designed to be deterministic and idempotent and wrap any side effects or non-deterministic operations inside tasks. You can use tasks from both the StateGraph (Graph API) and the Functional API.\n�\nRequirements\nTo leverage durable execution in LangGraph, you need to:\nEnable persistence in your workflow by specifying a checkpointer that will save workflow progress.\nSpecify a thread identifier when executing a workflow. This will track the execution history for a particular instance of the workflow.\nWrap any non-deterministic operations (e.g., random number generation) or operations with side effects (e.g., file writes, API calls) inside tasks to ensure that when a workflow is resumed, these operations are not repeated for the particular run, and instead their results are retrieved from the persistence layer. For more information, see Determinism and Consistent Replay.\n�\nDeterminism and consistent replay\nWhen you resume a workflow run, the code does NOT resume from the same line of code where execution stopped; instead, it will identify an appropriate starting point from which to pick up where it left off. This means that the workflow will replay all steps from the starting point until it reaches the point where it was stopped.\nAs a result, when you are writing a workflow for durable execution, you must wrap any non-deterministic operations (e.g., random number generation) and any operations with side effects (e.g., file writes, API calls) inside tasks or nodes.\nTo ensure that your workflow is deterministic and can be consistently replayed, follow these guidelines:\nAvoid Repeating Work: If a node contains multiple operations with side effects (e.g., logging, file writes, or network calls), wrap each operation in a separate task. This ensures that when the workflow is resumed, the operations are not repeated, and their results are retrieved from the persistence layer.\nEncapsulate Non-Deterministic Operations: Wrap any code that might yield non-deterministic results (e.g., random number generation) inside tasks or nodes. This ensures that, upon resumption, the workflow follows the exact recorded sequence of steps with the same outcomes.\nUse Idempotent Operations: When possible ensure that side effects (e.g., API calls, file writes) are idempotent. This means that if an operation is retried after a failure in the workflow, it will have the same effect as the first time it was executed. This is particularly important for operations that result in data writes. In the event that a task starts but fails to complete successfully, the workflow’s resumption will re-run the task, relying on recorded outcomes to maintain consistency. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid unintended duplication, ensuring a smooth and predictable workflow execution.\nFor some examples of pitfalls to avoid, see the Common Pitfalls section in the functional API, which shows how to structure your code using tasks to avoid these issues. The same principles apply to the StateGraph (Graph API).\n�\nDurability modes\nLangGraph supports three durability modes that allow you to balance performance and data consistency based on your application’s requirements. A higher durability mode adds more overhead to the workflow execution. You can specify the durability mode when calling any graph execution method:\nCopy\ngraph.stream(\n    {\"input\": \"test\"},\n    durability=\"sync\"\n)\n\nThe durability modes, from least to most durable, are as follows:\n\"exit\": LangGraph persists changes only when graph execution exits either successfully, with an error, or due to a human in the loop interrupt. This provides the best performance for long-running graphs but means intermediate state is not saved, so you cannot recover from system failures (like process crashes) that occur mid-execution.\n\"async\": LangGraph persists changes asynchronously while the next step executes. This provides good performance and durability, but there’s a small risk that LangGraph does not write checkpoints if the process crashes during execution.\n\"sync\": LangGraph persists changes synchronously before the next step starts. This ensures that LangGraph writes every checkpoint before continuing execution, providing high durability at the cost of some performance overhead.\n�\nUsing tasks in nodes\nIf a node contains multiple operations, you may find it easier to convert each operation into a task rather than refactor the operations into individual nodes.\nOriginal\nWith task\nCopy\nfrom typing import NotRequired\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nimport uuid\n\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nimport requests\n\n# Define a TypedDict to represent the state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    url: str\n    result: NotRequired[str]\n\ndef call_api(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Example node that makes an API request.\"\"\"\n    result = requests.get(state['url']).text[:100]  # Side-effect  #\n    return {\n        \"result\": result\n    }\n\n# Create a StateGraph builder and add a node for the call_api function\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"call_api\", call_api)\n\n# Connect the start and end nodes to the call_api node\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"call_api\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"call_api\", END)\n\n# Specify a checkpointer\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\n\n# Compile the graph with the checkpointer\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Define a config with a thread ID.\nthread_id = uuid.uuid4()\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": thread_id}}\n\n# Invoke the graph\ngraph.invoke({\"url\": \"https://www.example.com\"}, config)\n\n�\nResuming workflows\nOnce you have enabled durable execution in your workflow, you can resume execution for the following scenarios:\nPausing and Resuming Workflows: Use the interrupt function to pause a workflow at specific points and the Command primitive to resume it with updated state. See Interrupts for more details.\nRecovering from Failures: Automatically resume workflows from the last successful checkpoint after an exception (e.g., LLM provider outage). This involves executing the workflow with the same thread identifier by providing it with a None as the input value (see this example with the functional API).\n�\nStarting points for resuming workflows\nIf you’re using a StateGraph (Graph API), the starting point is the beginning of the node where execution stopped.\nIf you’re making a subgraph call inside a node, the starting point will be the parent node that called the subgraph that was halted. Inside the subgraph, the starting point will be the specific node where execution stopped.\nIf you’re using the Functional API, the starting point is the beginning of the entrypoint where execution stopped.\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

The following example uses Anthropic:\nInstall dependencies:\nCopy\npip install langchain_core langchain-anthropic langgraph\n\nInitialize the LLM:\nCopy\nimport os\nimport getpass\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\ndef _set_env(var: str):\n    if not os.environ.get(var):\n        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f\"{var}: \")\n\n\n_set_env(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\")\n\n�\nLLMs and augmentations\nWorkflows and agentic systems are based on LLMs and the various augmentations you add to them. Tool calling, structured outputs, and short term memory are a few options for tailoring LLMs to your needs.\nCopy\n# Schema for structured output\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\n\nclass SearchQuery(BaseModel):\n    search_query: str = Field(None, description=\"Query that is optimized web search.\")\n    justification: str = Field(\n        None, description=\"Why this query is relevant to the user's request.\"\n    )\n\n\n# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output\nstructured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)\n\n# Invoke the augmented LLM\noutput = structured_llm.invoke(\"How does Calcium CT score relate to high cholesterol?\")\n\n# Define a tool\ndef multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return a * b\n\n# Augment the LLM with tools\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([multiply])\n\n# Invoke the LLM with input that triggers the tool call\nmsg = llm_with_tools.invoke(\"What is 2 times 3?\")\n\n# Get the tool call\nmsg.tool_calls\n\n�\nPrompt chaining\nPrompt chaining is when each LLM call processes the output of the previous call. It’s often used for performing well-defined tasks that can be broken down into smaller, verifiable steps. Some examples include:\nTranslating documents into different languages\nVerifying generated content for consistency\nGraph API\nFunctional API\nCopy\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\n\n# Graph state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    topic: str\n    joke: str\n    improved_joke: str\n    final_joke: str\n\n\n# Nodes\ndef generate_joke(state: State):\n    \"\"\"First LLM call to generate initial joke\"\"\"\n\n    msg = llm.invoke(f\"Write a short joke about {state['topic']}\")\n    return {\"joke\": msg.content}\n\n\ndef check_punchline(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Gate function to check if the joke has a punchline\"\"\"\n\n    # Simple check - does the joke contain \"?\" or \"!\"\n    if \"?\" in state[\"joke\"] or \"!\" in state[\"joke\"]:\n        return \"Pass\"\n    return \"Fail\"\n\n\ndef improve_joke(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Second LLM call to improve the joke\"\"\"\n\n    msg = llm.invoke(f\"Make this joke funnier by adding wordplay: {state['joke']}\")\n    return {\"improved_joke\": msg.content}\n\n\ndef polish_joke(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Third LLM call for final polish\"\"\"\n    msg = llm.invoke(f\"Add a surprising twist to this joke: {state['improved_joke']}\")\n    return {\"final_joke\": msg.content}\n\n\n# Build workflow\nworkflow = StateGraph(State)\n\n# Add nodes\nworkflow.add_node(\"generate_joke\", generate_joke)\nworkflow.add_node(\"improve_joke\", improve_joke)\nworkflow.add_node(\"polish_joke\", polish_joke)\n\n# Add edges to connect nodes\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"generate_joke\")\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"generate_joke\", check_punchline, {\"Fail\": \"improve_joke\", \"Pass\": END}\n)\nworkflow.add_edge(\"improve_joke\", \"polish_joke\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"polish_joke\", END)\n\n# Compile\nchain = workflow.compile()\n\n# Show workflow\ndisplay(Image(chain.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\n# Invoke\nstate = chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"})\nprint(\"Initial joke:\")\nprint(state[\"joke\"])\nprint(\"\\n--- --- ---\\n\")\nif \"improved_joke\" in state:\n    print(\"Improved joke:\")\n    print(state[\"improved_joke\"])\n    print(\"\\n--- --- ---\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final joke:\")\n    print(state[\"final_joke\"])\nelse:\n    print(\"Final joke:\")\n    print(state[\"joke\"])\n\n�\nParallelization\nWith parallelization, LLMs work simultaneously on a task. This is either done by running multiple independent subtasks at the same time, or running the same task multiple times to check for different outputs. Parallelization is commonly used to:\nSplit up subtasks and run them in parallel, which increases speed\nRun tasks multiple times to check for different outputs, which increases confidence\nSome examples include:\nRunning one subtask that processes a document for keywords, and a second subtask to check for formatting errors\nRunning a task multiple times that scores a document for accuracy based on different criteria, like the number of citations, the number of sources used, and the quality of the sources\nGraph API\nFunctional API\nCopy\n# Graph state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    topic: str\n    joke: str\n    story: str\n    poem: str\n    combined_output: str\n\n\n# Nodes\ndef call_llm_1(state: State):\n    \"\"\"First LLM call to generate initial joke\"\"\"\n\n    msg = llm.invoke(f\"Write a joke about {state['topic']}\")\n    return {\"joke\": msg.content}\n\n\ndef call_llm_2(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Second LLM call to generate story\"\"\"\n\n    msg = llm.invoke(f\"Write a story about {state['topic']}\")\n    return {\"story\": msg.content}\n\n\ndef call_llm_3(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Third LLM call to generate poem\"\"\"\n\n    msg = llm.invoke(f\"Write a poem about {state['topic']}\")\n    return {\"poem\": msg.content}\n\n\ndef aggregator(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Combine the joke, story and poem into a single output\"\"\"\n\n    combined = f\"Here's a story, joke, and poem about {state['topic']}!\\n\\n\"\n    combined += f\"STORY:\\n{state['story']}\\n\\n\"\n    combined += f\"JOKE:\\n{state['joke']}\\n\\n\"\n    combined += f\"POEM:\\n{state['poem']}\"\n    return {\"combined_output\": combined}\n\n\n# Build workflow\nparallel_builder = StateGraph(State)\n\n# Add nodes\nparallel_builder.add_node(\"call_llm_1\", call_llm_1)\nparallel_builder.add_node(\"call_llm_2\", call_llm_2)\nparallel_builder.add_node(\"call_llm_3\", call_llm_3)\nparallel_builder.add_node(\"aggregator\", aggregator)\n\n# Add edges to connect nodes\nparallel_builder.add_edge(START, \"call_llm_1\")\nparallel_builder.add_edge(START, \"call_llm_2\")\nparallel_builder.add_edge(START, \"call_llm_3\")\nparallel_builder.add_edge(\"call_llm_1\", \"aggregator\")\nparallel_builder.add_edge(\"call_llm_2\", \"aggregator\")\nparallel_builder.add_edge(\"call_llm_3\", \"aggregator\")\nparallel_builder.add_edge(\"aggregator\", END)\nparallel_workflow = parallel_builder.compile()\n\n# Show workflow\ndisplay(Image(parallel_workflow.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\n# Invoke\nstate = parallel_workflow.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"})\nprint(state[\"combined_output\"])\n\n�\nRouting\nRouting workflows process inputs and then directs them to context-specific tasks. This allows you to define specialized flows for complex tasks. For example, a workflow built to answer product related questions might process the type of question first, and then route the request to specific processes for pricing, refunds, returns, etc.\nGraph API\nFunctional API\nCopy\nfrom typing_extensions import Literal\nfrom langchain.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage\n\n\n# Schema for structured output to use as routing logic\nclass Route(BaseModel):\n    step: Literal[\"poem\", \"story\", \"joke\"] = Field(\n        None, description=\"The next step in the routing process\"\n    )\n\n\n# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output\nrouter = llm.with_structured_output(Route)\n\n\n# State\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    decision: str\n    output: str\n\n\n# Nodes\ndef llm_call_1(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Write a story\"\"\"\n\n    result = llm.invoke(state[\"input\"])\n    return {\"output\": result.content}\n\n\ndef llm_call_2(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Write a joke\"\"\"\n\n    result = llm.invoke(state[\"input\"])\n    return {\"output\": result.content}\n\n\ndef llm_call_3(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Write a poem\"\"\"\n\n    result = llm.invoke(state[\"input\"])\n    return {\"output\": result.content}\n\n\ndef llm_call_router(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Route the input to the appropriate node\"\"\"\n\n    # Run the augmented LLM with structured output to serve as routing logic\n    decision = router.invoke(\n        [\n            SystemMessage(\n                content=\"Route the input to story, joke, or poem based on the user's request.\"\n            ),\n            HumanMessage(content=state[\"input\"]),\n        ]\n    )\n\n    return {\"decision\": decision.step}\n\n\n# Conditional edge function to route to the appropriate node\ndef route_decision(state: State):\n    # Return the node name you want to visit next\n    if state[\"decision\"] == \"story\":\n        return \"llm_call_1\"\n    elif state[\"decision\"] == \"joke\":\n        return \"llm_call_2\"\n    elif state[\"decision\"] == \"poem\":\n        return \"llm_call_3\"\n\n\n# Build workflow\nrouter_builder = StateGraph(State)\n\n# Add nodes\nrouter_builder.add_node(\"llm_call_1\", llm_call_1)\nrouter_builder.add_node(\"llm_call_2\", llm_call_2)\nrouter_builder.add_node(\"llm_call_3\", llm_call_3)\nrouter_builder.add_node(\"llm_call_router\", llm_call_router)\n\n# Add edges to connect nodes\nrouter_builder.add_edge(START, \"llm_call_router\")\nrouter_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"llm_call_router\",\n    route_decision,\n    {  # Name returned by route_decision : Name of next node to visit\n        \"llm_call_1\": \"llm_call_1\",\n        \"llm_call_2\": \"llm_call_2\",\n        \"llm_call_3\": \"llm_call_3\",\n    },\n)\nrouter_builder.add_edge(\"llm_call_1\", END)\nrouter_builder.add_edge(\"llm_call_2\", END)\nrouter_builder.add_edge(\"llm_call_3\", END)\n\n# Compile workflow\nrouter_workflow = router_builder.compile()\n\n# Show the workflow\ndisplay(Image(router_workflow.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\n# Invoke\nstate = router_workflow.invoke({\"input\": \"Write me a joke about cats\"})\nprint(state[\"output\"])\n\n�\nOrchestrator-worker\nIn an orchestrator-worker configuration, the orchestrator:\nBreaks down tasks into subtasks\nDelegates subtasks to workers\nSynthesizes worker outputs into a final result\nOrchestrator-worker workflows provide more flexibility and are often used when subtasks cannot be predefined the way they can with parallelization. This is common with workflows that write code or need to update content across multiple files. For example, a workflow that needs to update installation instructions for multiple Python libraries across an unknown number of documents might use this pattern.\nGraph API\nFunctional API\nCopy\nfrom typing import Annotated, List\nimport operator\n\n\n# Schema for structured output to use in planning\nclass Section(BaseModel):\n    name: str = Field(\n        description=\"Name for this section of the report.\",\n    )\n    description: str = Field(\n        description=\"Brief overview of the main topics and concepts to be covered in this section.\",\n    )\n\n\nclass Sections(BaseModel):\n    sections: List[Section] = Field(\n        description=\"Sections of the report.\",\n    )\n\n\n# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output\nplanner = llm.with_structured_output(Sections)\n\n�\nCreating workers in LangGraph\nOrchestrator-worker workflows are common and LangGraph has built-in support for them. The Send API lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send them specific inputs. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. The example below iterates over a list of sections and uses the Send API to send a section to each worker.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.types import Send\n\n\n# Graph state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    topic: str  # Report topic\n    sections: list[Section]  # List of report sections\n    completed_sections: Annotated[\n        list, operator.add\n    ]  # All workers write to this key in parallel\n    final_report: str  # Final report\n\n\n# Worker state\nclass WorkerState(TypedDict):\n    section: Section\n    completed_sections: Annotated[list, operator.add]\n\n\n# Nodes\ndef orchestrator(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Orchestrator that generates a plan for the report\"\"\"\n\n    # Generate queries\n    report_sections = planner.invoke(\n        [\n            SystemMessage(content=\"Generate a plan for the report.\"),\n            HumanMessage(content=f\"Here is the report topic: {state['topic']}\"),\n        ]\n    )\n\n    return {\"sections\": report_sections.sections}\n\n\ndef llm_call(state: WorkerState):\n    \"\"\"Worker writes a section of the report\"\"\"\n\n    # Generate section\n    section = llm.invoke(\n        [\n            SystemMessage(\n                content=\"Write a report section following the provided name and description.

If the evaluator or a human-in-the-loop determines the response needs refinement, feedback is provided and the response is recreated. This loop continues until an acceptable response is generated.\nEvaluator-optimizer workflows are commonly used when there’s particular success criteria for a task, but iteration is required to meet that criteria. For example, there’s not always a perfect match when translating text between two languages. It might take a few iterations to generate a translation with the same meaning across the two languages.\nGraph API\nFunctional API\nCopy\n# Graph state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    joke: str\n    topic: str\n    feedback: str\n    funny_or_not: str\n\n\n# Schema for structured output to use in evaluation\nclass Feedback(BaseModel):\n    grade: Literal[\"funny\", \"not funny\"] = Field(\n        description=\"Decide if the joke is funny or not.\",\n    )\n    feedback: str = Field(\n        description=\"If the joke is not funny, provide feedback on how to improve it.\",\n    )\n\n\n# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output\nevaluator = llm.with_structured_output(Feedback)\n\n\n# Nodes\ndef llm_call_generator(state: State):\n    \"\"\"LLM generates a joke\"\"\"\n\n    if state.get(\"feedback\"):\n        msg = llm.invoke(\n            f\"Write a joke about {state['topic']} but take into account the feedback: {state['feedback']}\"\n        )\n    else:\n        msg = llm.invoke(f\"Write a joke about {state['topic']}\")\n    return {\"joke\": msg.content}\n\n\ndef llm_call_evaluator(state: State):\n    \"\"\"LLM evaluates the joke\"\"\"\n\n    grade = evaluator.invoke(f\"Grade the joke {state['joke']}\")\n    return {\"funny_or_not\": grade.grade, \"feedback\": grade.feedback}\n\n\n# Conditional edge function to route back to joke generator or end based upon feedback from the evaluator\ndef route_joke(state: State):\n    \"\"\"Route back to joke generator or end based upon feedback from the evaluator\"\"\"\n\n    if state[\"funny_or_not\"] == \"funny\":\n        return \"Accepted\"\n    elif state[\"funny_or_not\"] == \"not funny\":\n        return \"Rejected + Feedback\"\n\n\n# Build workflow\noptimizer_builder = StateGraph(State)\n\n# Add the nodes\noptimizer_builder.add_node(\"llm_call_generator\", llm_call_generator)\noptimizer_builder.add_node(\"llm_call_evaluator\", llm_call_evaluator)\n\n# Add edges to connect nodes\noptimizer_builder.add_edge(START, \"llm_call_generator\")\noptimizer_builder.add_edge(\"llm_call_generator\", \"llm_call_evaluator\")\noptimizer_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"llm_call_evaluator\",\n    route_joke,\n    {  # Name returned by route_joke : Name of next node to visit\n        \"Accepted\": END,\n        \"Rejected + Feedback\": \"llm_call_generator\",\n    },\n)\n\n# Compile the workflow\noptimizer_workflow = optimizer_builder.compile()\n\n# Show the workflow\ndisplay(Image(optimizer_workflow.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\n# Invoke\nstate = optimizer_workflow.invoke({\"topic\": \"Cats\"})\nprint(state[\"joke\"])\n\n�\nAgents\nAgents are typically implemented as an LLM performing actions using tools. They operate in continuous feedback loops, and are used in situations where problems and solutions are unpredictable. Agents have more autonomy than workflows, and can make decisions about the tools they use and how to solve problems. You can still define the available toolset and guidelines for how agents behave.\nTo get started with agents, see the quickstart or read more about how they work in LangChain.\nUsing tools\nCopy\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\n\n\n# Define tools\n@tool\ndef multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Multiply `a` and `b`.\n\n    Args:\n        a: First int\n        b: Second int\n    \"\"\"\n    return a * b\n\n\n@tool\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Adds `a` and `b`.\n\n    Args:\n        a: First int\n        b: Second int\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\n\n@tool\ndef divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Divide `a` and `b`.\n\n    Args:\n        a: First int\n        b: Second int\n    \"\"\"\n    return a / b\n\n\n# Augment the LLM with tools\ntools = [add, multiply, divide]\ntools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n\nGraph API\nFunctional API\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\nfrom langchain.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage, ToolMessage\n\n\n# Nodes\ndef llm_call(state: MessagesState):\n    \"\"\"LLM decides whether to call a tool or not\"\"\"\n\n    return {\n        \"messages\": [\n            llm_with_tools.invoke(\n                [\n                    SystemMessage(\n                        content=\"You are a helpful assistant tasked with performing arithmetic on a set of inputs.\"\n                    )\n                ]\n                + state[\"messages\"]\n            )\n        ]\n    }\n\n\ndef tool_node(state: dict):\n    \"\"\"Performs the tool call\"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n    for tool_call in state[\"messages\"][-1].tool_calls:\n        tool = tools_by_name[tool_call[\"name\"]]\n        observation = tool.invoke(tool_call[\"args\"])\n        result.append(ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call[\"id\"]))\n    return {\"messages\": result}\n\n\n# Conditional edge function to route to the tool node or end based upon whether the LLM made a tool call\ndef should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal[\"tool_node\", END]:\n    \"\"\"Decide if we should continue the loop or stop based upon whether the LLM made a tool call\"\"\"\n\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    last_message = messages[-1]\n\n    # If the LLM makes a tool call, then perform an action\n    if last_message.tool_calls:\n        return \"tool_node\"\n\n    # Otherwise, we stop (reply to the user)\n    return END\n\n\n# Build workflow\nagent_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)\n\n# Add nodes\nagent_builder.add_node(\"llm_call\", llm_call)\nagent_builder.add_node(\"tool_node\", tool_node)\n\n# Add edges to connect nodes\nagent_builder.add_edge(START, \"llm_call\")\nagent_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"llm_call\",\n    should_continue,\n    [\"tool_node\", END]\n)\nagent_builder.add_edge(\"tool_node\", \"llm_call\")\n\n# Compile the agent\nagent = agent_builder.compile()\n\n# Show the agent\ndisplay(Image(agent.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))\n\n# Invoke\nmessages = [HumanMessage(content=\"Add 3 and 4.\")]\nmessages = agent.invoke({\"messages\": messages})\nfor m in messages[\"messages\"]:\n    m.pretty_print()\n\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

When you compile a graph with a checkpointer, the checkpointer saves a checkpoint of the graph state at every super-step. Those checkpoints are saved to a thread, which can be accessed after graph execution. Because threads allow access to graph’s state after execution, several powerful capabilities including human-in-the-loop, memory, time travel, and fault-tolerance are all possible. Below, we’ll discuss each of these concepts in more detail.\nAgent Server handles checkpointing automatically When using the Agent Server, you don’t need to implement or configure checkpointers manually. The server handles all persistence infrastructure for you behind the scenes.\n�\nThreads\nA thread is a unique ID or thread identifier assigned to each checkpoint saved by a checkpointer. It contains the accumulated state of a sequence of runs. When a run is executed, the state of the underlying graph of the assistant will be persisted to the thread.\nWhen invoking a graph with a checkpointer, you must specify a thread_id as part of the configurable portion of the config:\nCopy\n{\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n\nA thread’s current and historical state can be retrieved. To persist state, a thread must be created prior to executing a run. The LangSmith API provides several endpoints for creating and managing threads and thread state. See the API reference for more details.\nThe checkpointer uses thread_id as the primary key for storing and retrieving checkpoints. Without it, the checkpointer cannot save state or resume execution after an interrupt, since the checkpointer uses thread_id to load the saved state.\n�\nCheckpoints\nThe state of a thread at a particular point in time is called a checkpoint. Checkpoint is a snapshot of the graph state saved at each super-step and is represented by StateSnapshot object with the following key properties:\nconfig: Config associated with this checkpoint.\nmetadata: Metadata associated with this checkpoint.\nvalues: Values of the state channels at this point in time.\nnext A tuple of the node names to execute next in the graph.\ntasks: A tuple of PregelTask objects that contain information about next tasks to be executed. If the step was previously attempted, it will include error information. If a graph was interrupted dynamically from within a node, tasks will contain additional data associated with interrupts.\nCheckpoints are persisted and can be used to restore the state of a thread at a later time.\nLet’s see what checkpoints are saved when a simple graph is invoked as follows:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom operator import add\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]\n\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    return {\"foo\": \"a\", \"bar\": [\"a\"]}\n\ndef node_b(state: State):\n    return {\"foo\": \"b\", \"bar\": [\"b\"]}\n\n\nworkflow = StateGraph(State)\nworkflow.add_node(node_a)\nworkflow.add_node(node_b)\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"node_b\", END)\n\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\ngraph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\nconfig: RunnableConfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\ngraph.invoke({\"foo\": \"\", \"bar\":[]}, config)\n\nAfter we run the graph, we expect to see exactly 4 checkpoints:\nEmpty checkpoint with START as the next node to be executed\nCheckpoint with the user input {'foo': '', 'bar': []} and node_a as the next node to be executed\nCheckpoint with the outputs of node_a {'foo': 'a', 'bar': ['a']} and node_b as the next node to be executed\nCheckpoint with the outputs of node_b {'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['a', 'b']} and no next nodes to be executed\nNote that we bar channel values contain outputs from both nodes as we have a reducer for bar channel.\n�\nGet state\nWhen interacting with the saved graph state, you must specify a thread identifier. You can view the latest state of the graph by calling graph.get_state(config). This will return a StateSnapshot object that corresponds to the latest checkpoint associated with the thread ID provided in the config or a checkpoint associated with a checkpoint ID for the thread, if provided.\nCopy\n# get the latest state snapshot\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\ngraph.get_state(config)\n\n# get a state snapshot for a specific checkpoint_id\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\", \"checkpoint_id\": \"1ef663ba-28fe-6528-8002-5a559208592c\"}}\ngraph.get_state(config)\n\nIn our example, the output of get_state will look like this:\nCopy\nStateSnapshot(\n    values={'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['a', 'b']},\n    next=(),\n    config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28fe-6528-8002-5a559208592c'}},\n    metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'node_b': {'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['b']}}, 'step': 2},\n    created_at='2024-08-29T19:19:38.821749+00:00',\n    parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f9-6ec4-8001-31981c2c39f8'}}, tasks=()\n)\n\n�\nGet state history\nYou can get the full history of the graph execution for a given thread by calling graph.get_state_history(config). This will return a list of StateSnapshot objects associated with the thread ID provided in the config. Importantly, the checkpoints will be ordered chronologically with the most recent checkpoint / StateSnapshot being the first in the list.\nCopy\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\nlist(graph.get_state_history(config))\n\nIn our example, the output of get_state_history will look like this:\nCopy\n[\n    StateSnapshot(\n        values={'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['a', 'b']},\n        next=(),\n        config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28fe-6528-8002-5a559208592c'}},\n        metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'node_b': {'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['b']}}, 'step': 2},\n        created_at='2024-08-29T19:19:38.821749+00:00',\n        parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f9-6ec4-8001-31981c2c39f8'}},\n        tasks=(),\n    ),\n    StateSnapshot(\n        values={'foo': 'a', 'bar': ['a']},\n        next=('node_b',),\n        config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f9-6ec4-8001-31981c2c39f8'}},\n        metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'node_a': {'foo': 'a', 'bar': ['a']}}, 'step': 1},\n        created_at='2024-08-29T19:19:38.819946+00:00',\n        parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f4-6b4a-8000-ca575a13d36a'}},\n        tasks=(PregelTask(id='6fb7314f-f114-5413-a1f3-d37dfe98ff44', name='node_b', error=None, interrupts=()),),\n    ),\n    StateSnapshot(\n        values={'foo': '', 'bar': []},\n        next=('node_a',),\n        config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f4-6b4a-8000-ca575a13d36a'}},\n        metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': None, 'step': 0},\n        created_at='2024-08-29T19:19:38.817813+00:00',\n        parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f0-6c66-bfff-6723431e8481'}},\n        tasks=(PregelTask(id='f1b14528-5ee5-579c-949b-23ef9bfbed58', name='node_a', error=None, interrupts=()),),\n    ),\n    StateSnapshot(\n        values={'bar': []},\n        next=('__start__',),\n        config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f0-6c66-bfff-6723431e8481'}},\n        metadata={'source': 'input', 'writes': {'foo': ''}, 'step': -1},\n        created_at='2024-08-29T19:19:38.816205+00:00',\n        parent_config=None,\n        tasks=(PregelTask(id='6d27aa2e-d72b-5504-a36f-8620e54a76dd', name='__start__', error=None, interrupts=()),),\n    )\n]\n\n�\nReplay\nIt’s also possible to play-back a prior graph execution. If we invoke a graph with a thread_id and a checkpoint_id, then we will re-play the previously executed steps before a checkpoint that corresponds to the checkpoint_id, and only execute the steps after the checkpoint.\nthread_id is the ID of a thread.\ncheckpoint_id is an identifier that refers to a specific checkpoint within a thread.\nYou must pass these when invoking the graph as part of the configurable portion of the config:\nCopy\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\", \"checkpoint_id\": \"0c62ca34-ac19-445d-bbb0-5b4984975b2a\"}}\ngraph.invoke(None, config=config)\n\nImportantly, LangGraph knows whether a particular step has been executed previously. If it has, LangGraph simply re-plays that particular step in the graph and does not re-execute the step, but only for the steps before the provided checkpoint_id. All of the steps after checkpoint_id will be executed (i.e., a new fork), even if they have been executed previously. See this how to guide on time-travel to learn more about replaying.\n�\nUpdate state\nIn addition to re-playing the graph from specific checkpoints, we can also edit the graph state. We do this using update_state. This method accepts three different arguments:\n�\nconfig\nThe config should contain thread_id specifying which thread to update. When only the thread_id is passed, we update (or fork) the current state. Optionally, if we include checkpoint_id field, then we fork that selected checkpoint.\n�\nvalues\nThese are the values that will be used to update the state. Note that this update is treated exactly as any update from a node is treated. This means that these values will be passed to the reducer functions, if they are defined for some of the channels in the graph state. This means that update_state does NOT automatically overwrite the channel values for every channel, but only for the channels without reducers. Let’s walk through an example.\nLet’s assume you have defined the state of your graph with the following schema (see full example above):\nCopy\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom operator import add\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: int\n    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]\n\nLet’s now assume the current state of the graph is\nCopy\n{\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"a\"]}\n\nIf you update the state as below:\nCopy\ngraph.update_state(config, {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"b\"]})\n\nThen the new state of the graph will be:\nCopy\n{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"a\", \"b\"]}\n\nThe foo key (channel) is completely changed (because there is no reducer specified for that channel, so update_state overwrites it). However, there is a reducer specified for the bar key, and so it appends \"b\" to the state of bar.\n�\nas_node\nThe final thing you can optionally specify when calling update_state is as_node. If you provided it, the update will be applied as if it came from node as_node. If as_node is not provided, it will be set to the last node that updated the state, if not ambiguous. The reason this matters is that the next steps to execute depend on the last node to have given an update, so this can be used to control which node executes next. See this how to guide on time-travel to learn more about forking state.\n�\nMemory store\nA state schema specifies a set of keys that are populated as a graph is executed. As discussed above, state can be written by a checkpointer to a thread at each graph step, enabling state persistence.\nBut, what if we want to retain some information across threads? Consider the case of a chatbot where we want to retain specific information about the user across all chat conversations (e.g., threads) with that user!\nWith checkpointers alone, we cannot share information across threads. This motivates the need for the Store interface. As an illustration, we can define an InMemoryStore to store information about a user across threads. We simply compile our graph with a checkpointer, as before, and pass the store.\nLangGraph API handles stores automatically When using the LangGraph API, you don’t need to implement or configure stores manually. The API handles all storage infrastructure for you behind the scenes.\nInMemoryStore is suitable for development and testing. For production, use a persistent store like PostgresStore or RedisStore. All implementations extend BaseStore, which is the type annotation to use in node function signatures.\n�\nBasic usage\nFirst, let’s showcase this in isolation without using LangGraph.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore\nstore = InMemoryStore()\n\nMemories are namespaced by a tuple, which in this specific example will be (<user_id>, \"memories\"). The namespace can be any length and represent anything, does not have to be user specific.\nCopy\nuser_id = \"1\"\nnamespace_for_memory = (user_id, \"memories\")\n\nWe use the store.put method to save memories to our namespace in the store. When we do this, we specify the namespace, as defined above, and a key-value pair for the memory: the key is simply a unique identifier for the memory (memory_id) and the value (a dictionary) is the memory itself.\nCopy\nmemory_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\nmemory = {\"food_preference\" : \"I like pizza\"}\nstore.put(namespace_for_memory, memory_id, memory)\n\nWe can read out memories in our namespace using the store.search method, which will return all memories for a given user as a list. The most recent memory is the last in the list.\nCopy\nmemories = store.search(namespace_for_memory)\nmemories[-1].dict()\n{'value': {'food_preference': 'I like pizza'},\n 'key': '07e0caf4-1631-47b7-b15f-65515d4c1843',\n 'namespace': ['1', 'memories'],\n 'created_at': '2024-10-02T17:22:31.590602+00:00',\n 'updated_at': '2024-10-02T17:22:31.590605+00:00'}\n\nEach memory type is a Python class (Item) with certain attributes. We can access it as a dictionary by converting via .dict as above.\nThe attributes it has are:\nvalue: The value (itself a dictionary) of this memory\nkey: A unique key for this memory in this namespace\nnamespace: A tuple of strings, the namespace of this memory type\nWhile the type is tuple[str, ...], it may be serialized as a list when converted to JSON (for example, ['1', 'memories']).\ncreated_at: Timestamp for when this memory was created\nupdated_at: Timestamp for when this memory was updated\n�\nSemantic search\nBeyond simple retrieval, the store also supports semantic search, allowing you to find memories based on meaning rather than exact matches. To enable this, configure the store with an embedding model:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.embeddings import init_embeddings\n\nstore = InMemoryStore(\n    index={\n        \"embed\": init_embeddings(\"openai:text-embedding-3-small\"),  # Embedding provider\n        \"dims\": 1536,                              # Embedding dimensions\n        \"fields\": [\"food_preference\", \"$\"]              # Fields to embed\n    }\n)\n\nNow when searching, you can use natural language queries to find relevant memories:\nCopy\n# Find memories about food preferences\n# (This can be done after putting memories into the store)\nmemories = store.search(\n    namespace_for_memory,\n    query=\"What does the user like to eat?\",\n    limit=3  # Return top 3 matches\n)\n\nYou can control which parts of your memories get embedded by configuring the fields parameter or by specifying the index parameter when storing memories:\nCopy\n# Store with specific fields to embed\nstore.put(\n    namespace_for_memory,\n    str(uuid.uuid4()),\n    {\n        \"food_preference\": \"I love Italian cuisine\",\n        \"context\": \"Discussing dinner plans\"\n    },\n    index=[\"food_preference\"]  # Only embed \"food_preferences\" field\n)\n\n# Store without embedding (still retrievable, but not searchable)\nstore.put(\n    namespace_for_memory,\n    str(uuid.uuid4()),\n    {\"system_info\": \"Last updated: 2024-01-01\"},\n    index=False\n)\n\n�\nUsing in LangGraph\nWith this all in place, we use the store in LangGraph. The store works hand-in-hand with the checkpointer: the checkpointer saves state to threads, as discussed above, and the store allows us to store arbitrary information for access across threads. We compile the graph with both the checkpointer and the store as follows.\nCopy\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n\n@dataclass\nclass Context:\n    user_id: str\n\n# We need this because we want to enable threads (conversations)\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\n\n# ... Define the graph ...\n\n# Compile the graph with the checkpointer and store\nbuilder = StateGraph(MessagesState, context_schema=Context)\n# ... add nodes and edges ...\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, store=store)\n\nWe invoke the graph with a thread_id, as before, and also with a user_id, which we’ll use to namespace our memories to this particular user as we showed above.\nCopy\n# Invoke the graph\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n\n# First let's just say hi to the AI\nfor update in graph.stream(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hi\"}]},\n    config,\n    stream_mode=\"updates\",\n    context=Context(user_id=\"1\"),\n):\n    print(update)\n\nYou can access the store and the user_id in any node by using the Runtime object. The Runtime is automatically injected by LangGraph when you add it as a parameter to your node function. Here’s how you might use it to save memories:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Context:\n    user_id: str\n\nasync def update_memory(state: MessagesState, runtime: Runtime[Context]):\n\n    # Get the user id from the runtime context\n    user_id = runtime.context.user_id\n\n    # Namespace the memory\n    namespace = (user_id, \"memories\")\n\n    # ... Analyze conversation and create a new memory\n\n    # Create a new memory ID\n    memory_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n\n    # We create a new memory\n    await runtime.store.aput(namespace, memory_id, {\"memory\": memory})\n\n\nAs we showed above, we can also access the store in any node and use the store.search method to get memories. Recall the memories are returned as a list of objects that can be converted to a dictionary.\nCopy\nmemories[-1].dict()\n{'value': {'food_preference': 'I like pizza'},\n 'key': '07e0caf4-1631-47b7-b15f-65515d4c1843',\n 'namespace': ['1', 'memories'],\n 'created_at': '2024-10-02T17:22:31.590602+00:00',\n 'updated_at': '2024-10-02T17:22:31.590605+00:00'}\n\nWe can access the memories and use them in our model call.\nCopy\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\n\n@dataclass\nclass Context:\n    user_id: str\n\nasync def call_model(state: MessagesState, runtime: Runtime[Context]):\n    # Get the user id from the runtime context\n    user_id = runtime.context.user_id\n\n    # Namespace the memory\n    namespace = (user_id, \"memories\")\n\n    # Search based on the most recent message\n    memories = await runtime.store.asearch(\n        namespace,\n        query=state[\"messages\"][-1].content,\n        limit=3\n    )\n    info = \"\\n\".join([d.value[\"memory\"] for d in memories])\n\n    # ... Use memories in the model call\n\nIf we create a new thread, we can still access the same memories so long as the user_id is the same.\nCopy\n# Invoke the graph on a new thread\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"2\"}}\n\n# Let's say hi again\nfor update in graph.stream(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hi, tell me about my memories\"}]},\n    config,\n    stream_mode=\"updates\",\n    context=Context(user_id=\"1\"),\n):\n    print(update)\n\nWhen we use the LangSmith, either locally (e.g., in Studio) or hosted with LangSmith, the base store is available to use by default and does not need to be specified during graph compilation. To enable semantic search, however, you do need to configure the indexing settings in your langgraph.json file. For example:\nCopy\n{\n    ...\n    \"store\": {\n        \"index\": {\n            \"embed\": \"openai:text-embeddings-3-small\",\n            \"dims\": 1536,\n            \"fields\": [\"$\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSee the deployment guide for more details and configuration options.\n�\nCheckpointer libraries\nUnder the hood, checkpointing is powered by checkpointer objects that conform to BaseCheckpointSaver interface. LangGraph provides several checkpointer implementations, all implemented via standalone, installable libraries:\nlanggraph-checkpoint: The base interface for checkpointer savers (BaseCheckpointSaver) and serialization/deserialization interface (SerializerProtocol). Includes in-memory checkpointer implementation (InMemorySaver) for experimentation. LangGraph comes with langgraph-checkpoint included.\nlanggraph-checkpoint-sqlite: An implementation of LangGraph checkpointer that uses SQLite database (SqliteSaver / AsyncSqliteSaver). Ideal for experimentation and local workflows. Needs to be installed separately.\nlanggraph-checkpoint-postgres: An advanced checkpointer that uses Postgres database (PostgresSaver / AsyncPostgresSaver), used in LangSmith. Ideal for using in production. Needs to be installed separately.\nlanggraph-checkpoint-cosmosdb: An implementation of LangGraph checkpointer that uses Azure Cosmos DB (@[CosmosDBSaver] / @[AsyncCosmosDBSaver]). Ideal for using in production with Azure. Supports both sync and async operations. Needs to be installed separately.\n�\nCheckpointer interface\nEach checkpointer conforms to BaseCheckpointSaver interface and implements the following methods:\n.put - Store a checkpoint with its configuration and metadata.\n.put_writes - Store intermediate writes linked to a checkpoint (i.e. pending writes).\n.get_tuple - Fetch a checkpoint tuple using for a given configuration (thread_id and checkpoint_id). This is used to populate StateSnapshot in graph.get_state().\n.list - List checkpoints that match a given configuration and filter criteria. This is used to populate state history in graph.get_state_history()\nIf the checkpointer is used with asynchronous graph execution (i.e. executing the graph via .ainvoke, .astream, .abatch), asynchronous versions of the above methods will be used (.aput, .aput_writes, .aget_tuple, .alist).\nFor running your graph asynchronously, you can use InMemorySaver, or async versions of Sqlite/Postgres checkpointers — AsyncSqliteSaver / AsyncPostgresSaver checkpointers.\n�\nSerializer\nWhen checkpointers save the graph state, they need to serialize the channel values in the state. This is done using serializer objects.\nlanggraph_checkpoint defines protocol for implementing serializers provides a default implementation (JsonPlusSerializer) that handles a wide variety of types, including LangChain and LangGraph primitives, datetimes, enums and more.\n�\nSerialization with pickle\nThe default serializer, JsonPlusSerializer, uses ormsgpack and JSON under the hood, which is not suitable for all types of objects.\nIf you want to fallback to pickle for objects not currently supported by our msgpack encoder (such as Pandas dataframes), you can use the pickle_fallback argument of the JsonPlusSerializer:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.serde.jsonplus import JsonPlusSerializer\n\n# ... Define the graph ...\ngraph.compile(\n    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(serde=JsonPlusSerializer(pickle_fallback=True))\n)\n\n�\nEncryption\nCheckpointers can optionally encrypt all persisted state. To enable this, pass an instance of EncryptedSerializer to the serde argument of any BaseCheckpointSaver implementation. The easiest way to create an encrypted serializer is via from_pycryptodome_aes, which reads the AES key from the LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY environment variable (or accepts a key argument):\nCopy\nimport sqlite3\n\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.serde.encrypted import EncryptedSerializer\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\n\nserde = EncryptedSerializer.from_pycryptodome_aes()  # reads LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY\ncheckpointer = SqliteSaver(sqlite3.connect(\"checkpoint.db\"), serde=serde)\n\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.serde.encrypted import EncryptedSerializer\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\n\nserde = EncryptedSerializer.from_pycryptodome_aes()\ncheckpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\"postgresql://...\", serde=serde)\ncheckpointer.setup()\n\nWhen running on LangSmith, encryption is automatically enabled whenever LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY is present, so you only need to provide the environment variable. Other encryption schemes can be used by implementing CipherProtocol and supplying it to EncryptedSerializer.\n�\nCapabilities\n�\nHuman-in-the-loop\nFirst, checkpointers facilitate human-in-the-loop workflows by allowing humans to inspect, interrupt, and approve graph steps. Checkpointers are needed for these workflows as the human has to be able to view the state of a graph at any point in time, and the graph has to be to resume execution after the human has made any updates to the state. See the how-to guides for examples.\n�\nMemory\nSecond, checkpointers allow for “memory” between interactions. In the case of repeated human interactions (like conversations) any follow up messages can be sent to that thread, which will retain its memory of previous ones. See Add memory for information on how to add and manage conversation memory using checkpointers.\n�\nTime travel\nThird, checkpointers allow for “time travel”, allowing users to replay prior graph executions to review and / or debug specific graph steps. In addition, checkpointers make it possible to fork the graph state at arbitrary checkpoints to explore alternative trajectories.\n�\nFault-tolerance\nLastly, checkpointing also provides fault-tolerance and error recovery: if one or more nodes fail at a given superstep, you can restart your graph from the last successful step. Additionally, when a graph node fails mid-execution at a given superstep, LangGraph stores pending checkpoint writes from any other nodes that completed successfully at that superstep, so that whenever we resume graph execution from that superstep we don’t re-run the successful nodes.\n�\nPending writes\nAdditionally, when a graph node fails mid-execution at a given superstep, LangGraph stores pending checkpoint writes from any other nodes that completed successfully at that superstep, so that whenever we resume graph execution from that superstep we don’t re-run the successful nodes.\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

Streaming is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on LLMs. By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs.\nWhat’s possible with LangGraph streaming:\n Stream graph state — get state updates / values with updates and values modes.\n Stream subgraph outputs — include outputs from both the parent graph and any nested subgraphs.\n Stream LLM tokens — capture token streams from anywhere: inside nodes, subgraphs, or tools.\n Stream custom data — send custom updates or progress signals directly from tool functions.\n Use multiple streaming modes — choose from values (full state), updates (state deltas), messages (LLM tokens + metadata), custom (arbitrary user data), or debug (detailed traces).\n�\nSupported stream modes\nPass one or more of the following stream modes as a list to the stream or astream methods:\nMode\tDescription\nvalues\tStreams the full value of the state after each step of the graph.\nupdates\tStreams the updates to the state after each step of the graph. If multiple updates are made in the same step (e.g., multiple nodes are run), those updates are streamed separately.\ncustom\tStreams custom data from inside your graph nodes.\nmessages\tStreams 2-tuples (LLM token, metadata) from any graph nodes where an LLM is invoked.\ndebug\tStreams as much information as possible throughout the execution of the graph.\n�\nBasic usage example\nLangGraph graphs expose the stream (sync) and astream (async) methods to yield streamed outputs as iterators.\nCopy\nfor chunk in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode=\"updates\"):\n    print(chunk)\n\n\nExtended example: streaming updates\n\n�\nStream multiple modes\nYou can pass a list as the stream_mode parameter to stream multiple modes at once.\nThe streamed outputs will be tuples of (mode, chunk) where mode is the name of the stream mode and chunk is the data streamed by that mode.\nCopy\nfor mode, chunk in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode=[\"updates\", \"custom\"]):\n    print(chunk)\n\n�\nStream graph state\nUse the stream modes updates and values to stream the state of the graph as it executes.\nupdates streams the updates to the state after each step of the graph.\nvalues streams the full value of the state after each step of the graph.\nCopy\nfrom typing import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n  topic: str\n  joke: str\n\n\ndef refine_topic(state: State):\n    return {\"topic\": state[\"topic\"] + \" and cats\"}\n\n\ndef generate_joke(state: State):\n    return {\"joke\": f\"This is a joke about {state['topic']}\"}\n\ngraph = (\n  StateGraph(State)\n  .add_node(refine_topic)\n  .add_node(generate_joke)\n  .add_edge(START, \"refine_topic\")\n  .add_edge(\"refine_topic\", \"generate_joke\")\n  .add_edge(\"generate_joke\", END)\n  .compile()\n)\n\nupdates\nvalues\nUse this to stream only the state updates returned by the nodes after each step. The streamed outputs include the name of the node as well as the update.\nCopy\nfor chunk in graph.stream(\n    {\"topic\": \"ice cream\"},\n    stream_mode=\"updates\",  \n):\n    print(chunk)\n\n�\nStream subgraph outputs\nTo include outputs from subgraphs in the streamed outputs, you can set subgraphs=True in the .stream() method of the parent graph. This will stream outputs from both the parent graph and any subgraphs.\nThe outputs will be streamed as tuples (namespace, data), where namespace is a tuple with the path to the node where a subgraph is invoked, e.g. (\"parent_node:<task_id>\", \"child_node:<task_id>\").\nCopy\nfor chunk in graph.stream(\n    {\"foo\": \"foo\"},\n    # Set subgraphs=True to stream outputs from subgraphs\n    subgraphs=True,  \n    stream_mode=\"updates\",\n):\n    print(chunk)\n\n\nExtended example: streaming from subgraphs\n\n�\nDebugging\nUse the debug streaming mode to stream as much information as possible throughout the execution of the graph. The streamed outputs include the name of the node as well as the full state.\nCopy\nfor chunk in graph.stream(\n    {\"topic\": \"ice cream\"},\n    stream_mode=\"debug\",  \n):\n    print(chunk)\n\n�\nLLM tokens\nUse the messages streaming mode to stream Large Language Model (LLM) outputs token by token from any part of your graph, including nodes, tools, subgraphs, or tasks.\nThe streamed output from messages mode is a tuple (message_chunk, metadata) where:\nmessage_chunk: the token or message segment from the LLM.\nmetadata: a dictionary containing details about the graph node and LLM invocation.\nIf your LLM is not available as a LangChain integration, you can stream its outputs using custom mode instead. See use with any LLM for details.\nManual config required for async in Python < 3.11 When using Python < 3.11 with async code, you must explicitly pass RunnableConfig to ainvoke() to enable proper streaming.

Resume execution from the checkpoint\nCapabilities\nUse time-travel\nCopy page\nWhen working with non-deterministic systems that make model-based decisions (e.g., agents powered by LLMs), it can be useful to examine their decision-making process in detail:\n Understand reasoning: Analyze the steps that led to a successful result.\n Debug mistakes: Identify where and why errors occurred.\n Explore alternatives: Test different paths to uncover better solutions.\nLangGraph provides time-travel functionality to support these use cases. Specifically, you can resume execution from a prior checkpoint — either replaying the same state or modifying it to explore alternatives. In all cases, resuming past execution produces a new fork in the history.\nTo use time-travel in LangGraph:\nRun the graph with initial inputs using invoke or stream methods.\nIdentify a checkpoint in an existing thread: Use the get_state_history method to retrieve the execution history for a specific thread_id and locate the desired checkpoint_id. Alternatively, set an interrupt before the node(s) where you want execution to pause. You can then find the most recent checkpoint recorded up to that interrupt.\nUpdate the graph state (optional): Use the update_state method to modify the graph’s state at the checkpoint and resume execution from alternative state.\nResume execution from the checkpoint: Use the invoke or stream methods with an input of None and a configuration containing the appropriate thread_id and checkpoint_id.\n�\nIn a workflow\nThis example builds a simple LangGraph workflow that generates a joke topic and writes a joke using an LLM. It demonstrates how to run the graph, retrieve past execution checkpoints, optionally modify the state, and resume execution from a chosen checkpoint to explore alternate outcomes.\n�\nSetup\nTo build this workflow in this example you need to set up the Anthropic LLM and install the required dependencies:\nInstall dependencies:\nCopy\npip install langchain_core langchain-anthropic langgraph\n\nInitialize the LLM:\nCopy\nimport os\nimport getpass\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\ndef _set_env(var: str):\n    if not os.environ.get(var):\n        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f\"{var}: \")\n\n\n_set_env(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\")\n\nSign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph.

This enables human-in-the-loop patterns where you need external input to proceed. When an interrupt is triggered, LangGraph saves the graph state using its persistence layer and waits indefinitely until you resume execution.\nInterrupts work by calling the interrupt() function at any point in your graph nodes. The function accepts any JSON-serializable value which is surfaced to the caller. When you’re ready to continue, you resume execution by re-invoking the graph using Command, which then becomes the return value of the interrupt() call from inside the node.\nUnlike static breakpoints (which pause before or after specific nodes), interrupts are dynamic—they can be placed anywhere in your code and can be conditional based on your application logic.\nCheckpointing keeps your place: the checkpointer writes the exact graph state so you can resume later, even when in an error state.\nthread_id is your pointer: set config={\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": ...}} to tell the checkpointer which state to load.\nInterrupt payloads surface as __interrupt__: the values you pass to interrupt() return to the caller in the __interrupt__ field so you know what the graph is waiting on.\nThe thread_id you choose is effectively your persistent cursor. Reusing it resumes the same checkpoint; using a new value starts a brand-new thread with an empty state.\n�\nPause using interrupt\nThe interrupt function pauses graph execution and returns a value to the caller. When you call interrupt within a node, LangGraph saves the current graph state and waits for you to resume execution with input.\nTo use interrupt, you need:\nA checkpointer to persist the graph state (use a durable checkpointer in production)\nA thread ID in your config so the runtime knows which state to resume from\nTo call interrupt() where you want to pause (payload must be JSON-serializable)\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and ask for approval\n    approved = interrupt(\"Do you approve this action?\")\n\n    # When you resume, Command(resume=...) returns that value here\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n\nWhen you call interrupt, here’s what happens:\nGraph execution gets suspended at the exact point where interrupt is called\nState is saved using the checkpointer so execution can be resumed later, In production, this should be a persistent checkpointer (e.g. backed by a database)\nValue is returned to the caller under __interrupt__; it can be any JSON-serializable value (string, object, array, etc.)\nGraph waits indefinitely until you resume execution with a response\nResponse is passed back into the node when you resume, becoming the return value of the interrupt() call\n�\nResuming interrupts\nAfter an interrupt pauses execution, you resume the graph by invoking it again with a Command that contains the resume value. The resume value is passed back to the interrupt call, allowing the node to continue execution with the external input.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\n\n# Initial run - hits the interrupt and pauses\n# thread_id is the persistent pointer (stores a stable ID in production)\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"thread-1\"}}\nresult = graph.invoke({\"input\": \"data\"}, config=config)\n\n# Check what was interrupted\n# __interrupt__ contains the payload that was passed to interrupt()\nprint(result[\"__interrupt__\"])\n# > [Interrupt(value='Do you approve this action?')]\n\n# Resume with the human's response\n# The resume payload becomes the return value of interrupt() inside the node\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\n\nKey points about resuming:\nYou must use the same thread ID when resuming that was used when the interrupt occurred\nThe value passed to Command(resume=...) becomes the return value of the interrupt call\nThe node restarts from the beginning of the node where the interrupt was called when resumed, so any code before the interrupt runs again\nYou can pass any JSON-serializable value as the resume value\n�\nCommon patterns\nThe key thing that interrupts unlock is the ability to pause execution and wait for external input. This is useful for a variety of use cases, including:\n Approval workflows: Pause before executing critical actions (API calls, database changes, financial transactions)\n Handling multiple interrupts: Pair interrupt IDs with resume values when resuming multiple interrupts in a single invocation\n Review and edit: Let humans review and modify LLM outputs or tool calls before continuing\n Interrupting tool calls: Pause before executing tool calls to review and edit the tool call before execution\n Validating human input: Pause before proceeding to the next step to validate human input\n�\nStream with human-in-the-loop (HITL) interrupts\nWhen building interactive agents with human-in-the-loop workflows, you can stream both message chunks and node updates simultaneously to provide real-time feedback while handling interrupts.\nUse multiple stream modes (\"messages\" and \"updates\") with subgraphs=True (if subgraphs are present) to:\nStream AI responses in real-time as they’re generated\nDetect when the graph encounters an interrupt\nHandle user input and resume execution seamlessly\nCopy\nasync for metadata, mode, chunk in graph.astream(\n    initial_input,\n    stream_mode=[\"messages\", \"updates\"],\n    subgraphs=True,\n    config=config\n):\n    if mode == \"messages\":\n        # Handle streaming message content\n        msg, _ = chunk\n        if isinstance(msg, AIMessageChunk) and msg.content:\n            # Display content in real-time\n            display_streaming_content(msg.content)\n\n    elif mode == \"updates\":\n        # Check for interrupts\n        if \"__interrupt__\" in chunk:\n            # Stop streaming display\n            interrupt_info = chunk[\"__interrupt__\"][0].value\n\n            # Handle user input\n            user_response = get_user_input(interrupt_info)\n\n            # Resume graph with updated input\n            initial_input = Command(resume=user_response)\n            break\n\n        else:\n            # Track node transitions\n            current_node = list(chunk.keys())[0]\n\nstream_mode=[\"messages\", \"updates\"]: Enables dual streaming of both message chunks and graph state updates\nsubgraphs=True: Required for interrupt detection in nested graphs\n\"__interrupt__\" detection: Signals when human input is needed\nCommand(resume=...): Resumes graph execution with user-provided data\n�\nHandling multiple interrupts\nWhen parallel branches interrupt simultaneously (for example, fan-out to multiple nodes that each call interrupt()), you may need to resume multiple interrupts in a single invocation. When resuming multiple interrupts with a single invocation, map each interrupt ID to its resume value. This ensures each response is paired with the correct interrupt at runtime.\nCopy\nfrom typing import Annotated, TypedDict\nimport operator\n\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import START, END, StateGraph\nfrom langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    vals: Annotated[list[str], operator.add]\n\n\ndef node_a(state):\n    answer = interrupt(\"question_a\")\n    return {\"vals\": [f\"a:{answer}\"]}\n\n\ndef node_b(state):\n    answer = interrupt(\"question_b\")\n    return {\"vals\": [f\"b:{answer}\"]}\n\n\ngraph = (\n    StateGraph(State)\n    .add_node(\"a\", node_a)\n    .add_node(\"b\", node_b)\n    .add_edge(START, \"a\")\n    .add_edge(START, \"b\")\n    .add_edge(\"a\", END)\n    .add_edge(\"b\", END)\n    .compile(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\n)\n\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n\n# Step 1: invoke — both parallel nodes hit interrupt() and pause\ninterrupted_result = graph.invoke({\"vals\": []}, config)\nprint(interrupted_result)\n\"\"\"\n{\n    'vals': [],\n    '__interrupt__': [\n        Interrupt(value='question_a', id='bd4f3183600f2c41dddafbf8f0f7be7b'),\n        Interrupt(value='question_b', id='29963e3d3585f0cef025dd0f14323f55')\n    ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Step 2: resume all pending interrupts at once\nresume_map = {\n    i.id: f\"answer for {i.value}\"\n    for i in interrupted_result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n}\nresult = graph.invoke(Command(resume=resume_map), config)\n\nprint(\"Final state:\", result)\n#> Final state: {'vals': ['a:answer for question_a', 'b:answer for question_b']}\n\n�\nApprove or reject\nOne of the most common uses of interrupts is to pause before a critical action and ask for approval. For example, you might want to ask a human to approve an API call, a database change, or any other important decision.\nCopy\nfrom typing import Literal\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\n\ndef approval_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"proceed\", \"cancel\"]]:\n    # Pause execution; payload shows up under result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n    is_approved = interrupt({\n        \"question\": \"Do you want to proceed with this action?\",\n        \"details\": state[\"action_details\"]\n    })\n\n    # Route based on the response\n    if is_approved:\n        return Command(goto=\"proceed\")  # Runs after the resume payload is provided\n    else:\n        return Command(goto=\"cancel\")\n\nWhen you resume the graph, pass true to approve or false to reject:\nCopy\n# To approve\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\n\n# To reject\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=False), config=config)\n\n\nFull example\n\n�\nReview and edit state\nSometimes you want to let a human review and edit part of the graph state before continuing. This is useful for correcting LLMs, adding missing information, or making adjustments.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef review_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and show the current content for review (surfaces in result[\"__interrupt__\"])\n    edited_content = interrupt({\n        \"instruction\": \"Review and edit this content\",\n        \"content\": state[\"generated_text\"]\n    })\n\n    # Update the state with the edited version\n    return {\"generated_text\": edited_content}\n\nWhen resuming, provide the edited content:\nCopy\ngraph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=\"The edited and improved text\"),  # Value becomes the return from interrupt()\n    config=config\n)\n\n\nFull example\n\n�\nInterrupts in tools\nYou can also place interrupts directly inside tool functions. This makes the tool itself pause for approval whenever it’s called, and allows for human review and editing of the tool call before it is executed.\nFirst, define a tool that uses interrupt:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\n@tool\ndef send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):\n    \"\"\"Send an email to a recipient.\"\"\"\n\n    # Pause before sending; payload surfaces in result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n    response = interrupt({\n        \"action\": \"send_email\",\n        \"to\": to,\n        \"subject\": subject,\n        \"body\": body,\n        \"message\": \"Approve sending this email?\"\n    })\n\n    if response.get(\"action\") == \"approve\":\n        # Resume value can override inputs before executing\n        final_to = response.get(\"to\", to)\n        final_subject = response.get(\"subject\", subject)\n        final_body = response.get(\"body\", body)\n        return f\"Email sent to {final_to} with subject '{final_subject}'\"\n    return \"Email cancelled by user\"\n\nThis approach is useful when you want the approval logic to live with the tool itself, making it reusable across different parts of your graph. The LLM can call the tool naturally, and the interrupt will pause execution whenever the tool is invoked, allowing you to approve, edit, or cancel the action.\n\nFull example\n\n�\nValidating human input\nSometimes you need to validate input from humans and ask again if it’s invalid. You can do this using multiple interrupt calls in a loop.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef get_age_node(state: State):\n    prompt = \"What is your age?\"\n\n    while True:\n        answer = interrupt(prompt)  # payload surfaces in result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n\n        # Validate the input\n        if isinstance(answer, int) and answer > 0:\n            # Valid input - continue\n            break\n        else:\n            # Invalid input - ask again with a more specific prompt\n            prompt = f\"'{answer}' is not a valid age. Please enter a positive number.\"\n\n    return {\"age\": answer}\n\nEach time you resume the graph with invalid input, it will ask again with a clearer message. Once valid input is provided, the node completes and the graph continues.\n\nFull example\n\n�\nRules of interrupts\nWhen you call interrupt within a node, LangGraph suspends execution by raising an exception that signals the runtime to pause. This exception propagates up through the call stack and is caught by the runtime, which notifies the graph to save the current state and wait for external input.\nWhen execution resumes (after you provide the requested input), the runtime restarts the entire node from the beginning—it does not resume from the exact line where interrupt was called. This means any code that ran before the interrupt will execute again. Because of this, there’s a few important rules to follow when working with interrupts to ensure they behave as expected.\n�\nDo not wrap interrupt calls in try/except\nThe way that interrupt pauses execution at the point of the call is by throwing a special exception. If you wrap the interrupt call in a try/except block, you will catch this exception and the interrupt will not be passed back to the graph.\n✅ Separate interrupt calls from error-prone code\n✅ Use specific exception types in try/except blocks\nSeparating logic\nExplicit exception handling\nCopy\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    # ✅ Good: interrupting first, then handling\n    # error conditions separately\n    interrupt(\"What's your name?\")\n    try:\n        fetch_data()  # This can fail\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    return state\n\n🔴 Do not wrap interrupt calls in bare try/except blocks\nCopy\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    # ❌ Bad: wrapping interrupt in bare try/except\n    # will catch the interrupt exception\n    try:\n        interrupt(\"What's your name?\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    return state\n\n�\nDo not reorder interrupt calls within a node\nIt’s common to use multiple interrupts in a single node, however this can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.\nWhen a node contains multiple interrupt calls, LangGraph keeps a list of resume values specific to the task executing the node. Whenever execution resumes, it starts at the beginning of the node. For each interrupt encountered, LangGraph checks if a matching value exists in the task’s resume list. Matching is strictly index-based, so the order of interrupt calls within the node is important.\n✅ Keep interrupt calls consistent across node executions\nCopy\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    # ✅ Good: interrupt calls happen in the same order every time\n    name = interrupt(\"What's your name?\")\n    age = interrupt(\"What's your age?\")\n    city = interrupt(\"What's your city?\")\n\n    return {\n        \"name\": name,\n        \"age\": age,\n        \"city\": city\n    }\n\n🔴 Do not conditionally skip interrupt calls within a node\n🔴 Do not loop interrupt calls using logic that isn’t deterministic across executions\nSkipping interrupts\nLooping interrupts\nCopy\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    # ❌ Bad: conditionally skipping interrupts changes the order\n    name = interrupt(\"What's your name?\")\n\n    # On first run, this might skip the interrupt\n    # On resume, it might not skip it - causing index mismatch\n    if state.get(\"needs_age\"):\n        age = interrupt(\"What's your age?\")\n\n    city = interrupt(\"What's your city?\")\n\n    return {\"name\": name, \"city\": city}\n\n�\nDo not return complex values in interrupt calls\nDepending on which checkpointer is used, complex values may not be serializable (e.g. you can’t serialize a function). To make your graphs adaptable to any deployment, it’s best practice to only use values that can be reasonably serialized.\n✅ Pass simple, JSON-serializable types to interrupt\n✅ Pass dictionaries/objects with simple values\nSimple values\nStructured data\nCopy\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    # ✅ Good: passing simple types that are serializable\n    name = interrupt(\"What's your name?\")\n    count = interrupt(42)\n    approved = interrupt(True)\n\n    return {\"name\": name, \"count\": count, \"approved\": approved}\n\n🔴 Do not pass functions, class instances, or other complex objects to interrupt\nFunctions\nClass instances\nCopy\ndef validate_input(value):\n    return len(value) > 0\n\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    # ❌ Bad: passing a function to interrupt\n    # The function cannot be serialized\n    response = interrupt({\n        \"question\": \"What's your name?\",\n        \"validator\": validate_input  # This will fail\n    })\n    return {\"name\": response}\n\n�\nSide effects called before interrupt must be idempotent\nBecause interrupts work by re-running the nodes they were called from, side effects called before interrupt should (ideally) be idempotent. For context, idempotency means that the same operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial execution.\nAs an example, you might have an API call to update a record inside of a node. If interrupt is called after that call is made, it will be re-run multiple times when the node is resumed, potentially overwriting the initial update or creating duplicate records.\n✅ Use idempotent operations before interrupt\n✅ Place side effects after interrupt calls\n✅ Separate side effects into separate nodes when possible\nIdempotent operations\nSide effects after interrupt\nSeparating into different nodes\nCopy\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    # ✅ Good: using upsert operation which is idempotent\n    # Running this multiple times will have the same result\n    db.upsert_user(\n        user_id=state[\"user_id\"],\n        status=\"pending_approval\"\n    )\n\n    approved = interrupt(\"Approve this change?\")\n\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n\n🔴 Do not perform non-idempotent operations before interrupt\n🔴 Do not create new records without checking if they exist\nCreating records\nAppending to lists\nCopy\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    # ❌ Bad: creating a new record before interrupt\n    # This will create duplicate records on each resume\n    audit_id = db.create_audit_log({\n        \"user_id\": state[\"user_id\"],\n        \"action\": \"pending_approval\",\n        \"timestamp\": datetime.now()\n    })\n\n    approved = interrupt(\"Approve this change?\")\n\n    return {\"approved\": approved, \"audit_id\": audit_id}\n\n�\nUsing with subgraphs called as functions\nWhen invoking a subgraph within a node, the parent graph will resume execution from the beginning of the node where the subgraph was invoked and the interrupt was triggered. Similarly, the subgraph will also resume from the beginning of the node where interrupt was called.\nCopy\ndef node_in_parent_graph(state: State):\n    some_code()  # <-- This will re-execute when resumed\n    # Invoke a subgraph as a function.\n    # The subgraph contains an `interrupt` call.\n    subgraph_result = subgraph.invoke(some_input)\n    # ...\n\ndef node_in_subgraph(state: State):\n    some_other_code()  # <-- This will also re-execute when resumed\n    result = interrupt(\"What's your name?\")\n    # ...\n\n�\nDebugging with interrupts\nTo debug and test a graph, you can use static interrupts as breakpoints to step through the graph execution one node at a time. Static interrupts are triggered at defined points either before or after a node executes. You can set these by specifying interrupt_before and interrupt_after when compiling the graph.\nStatic interrupts are not recommended for human-in-the-loop workflows. Use the interrupt function instead.\nAt compile time\nAt run time\nCopy\ngraph = builder.compile(\n    interrupt_before=[\"node_a\"],  \n    interrupt_after=[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"],  \n    checkpointer=checkpointer,\n)\n\n# Pass a thread ID to the graph\nconfig = {\n    \"configurable\": {\n        \"thread_id\": \"some_thread\"\n    }\n}\n\n# Run the graph until the breakpoint\ngraph.invoke(inputs, config=config)  \n\n# Resume the graph\ngraph.invoke(None, config=config)  \n\nThe breakpoints are set during compile time.\ninterrupt_before specifies the nodes where execution should pause before the node is executed.\ninterrupt_after specifies the nodes where execution should pause after the node is executed.\nA checkpointer is required to enable breakpoints.\nThe graph is run until the first breakpoint is hit.\nThe graph is resumed by passing in None for the input. This will run the graph until the next breakpoint is hit.\nTo debug your interrupts, use LangSmith.\n�\nUsing LangSmith Studio\nYou can use LangSmith Studio to set static interrupts in your graph in the UI before running the graph. You can also use the UI to inspect the graph state at any point in the execution.\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

In LangGraph, you can add two types of memory:\nAdd short-term memory as a part of your agent’s state to enable multi-turn conversations.\nAdd long-term memory to store user-specific or application-level data across sessions.\n�\nAdd short-term memory\nShort-term memory (thread-level persistence) enables agents to track multi-turn conversations. To add short-term memory:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver  \nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()  \n\nbuilder = StateGraph(...)\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)  \n\ngraph.invoke(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hi! i am Bob\"}]},\n    {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}},  \n)\n\n�\nUse in production\nIn production, use a checkpointer backed by a database:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\n\nDB_URI = \"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5442/postgres?sslmode=disable\"\nwith PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as checkpointer:  \n    builder = StateGraph(...)\n    graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)  \n\n\nExample: using Postgres checkpointer\n\nExample: using MongoDB checkpointer\n\nExample: using Redis checkpointer\n\n�\nUse in subgraphs\nIf your graph contains subgraphs, you only need to provide the checkpointer when compiling the parent graph. LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n\n# Subgraph\n\ndef subgraph_node_1(state: State):\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"foo\"] + \"bar\"}\n\nsubgraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\nsubgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)\nsubgraph_builder.add_edge(START, \"subgraph_node_1\")\nsubgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()  \n\n# Parent graph\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_1\", subgraph)  \nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\n\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)  \n\nYou can configure subgraph-specific checkpointing behavior.

The recommended way to access the store is through the Runtime object.\nCopy\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START\nimport uuid\n\n@dataclass\nclass Context:\n    user_id: str\n\nasync def call_model(state: MessagesState, runtime: Runtime[Context]):  \n    user_id = runtime.context.user_id  \n    namespace = (user_id, \"memories\")\n\n    # Search for relevant memories\n    memories = await runtime.store.asearch(  \n        namespace, query=state[\"messages\"][-1].content, limit=3\n    )\n    info = \"\\n\".join([d.value[\"data\"] for d in memories])\n\n    # ...

Common solutions are:\nTrim messages: Remove first or last N messages (before calling LLM)\nDelete messages from LangGraph state permanently\nSummarize messages: Summarize earlier messages in the history and replace them with a summary\nManage checkpoints to store and retrieve message history\nCustom strategies (e.g., message filtering, etc.)\nThis allows the agent to keep track of the conversation without exceeding the LLM’s context window.\n�\nTrim messages\nMost LLMs have a maximum supported context window (denominated in tokens). One way to decide when to truncate messages is to count the tokens in the message history and truncate whenever it approaches that limit. If you’re using LangChain, you can use the trim messages utility and specify the number of tokens to keep from the list, as well as the strategy (e.g., keep the last max_tokens) to use for handling the boundary.\nTo trim message history, use the trim_messages function:\nCopy\nfrom langchain_core.messages.utils import (  \n    trim_messages,  \n    count_tokens_approximately  \n)  \n\ndef call_model(state: MessagesState):\n    messages = trim_messages(  \n        state[\"messages\"],\n        strategy=\"last\",\n        token_counter=count_tokens_approximately,\n        max_tokens=128,\n        start_on=\"human\",\n        end_on=(\"human\", \"tool\"),\n    )\n    response = model.invoke(messages)\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(MessagesState)\nbuilder.add_node(call_model)\n...\n\n\nFull example: trim messages\n\n�\nDelete messages\nYou can delete messages from the graph state to manage the message history. This is useful when you want to remove specific messages or clear the entire message history.\nTo delete messages from the graph state, you can use the RemoveMessage. For RemoveMessage to work, you need to use a state key with add_messages reducer, like MessagesState.\nTo remove specific messages:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import RemoveMessage  \n\ndef delete_messages(state):\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    if len(messages) > 2:\n        # remove the earliest two messages\n        return {\"messages\": [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in messages[:2]]}  \n\nTo remove all messages:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES\n\ndef delete_messages(state):\n    return {\"messages\": [RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES)]}  \n\nWhen deleting messages, make sure that the resulting message history is valid. Check the limitations of the LLM provider you’re using. For example:\nSome providers expect message history to start with a user message\nMost providers require assistant messages with tool calls to be followed by corresponding tool result messages.\n\nFull example: delete messages\n\n�\nSummarize messages\nThe problem with trimming or removing messages, as shown above, is that you may lose information from culling of the message queue. Because of this, some applications benefit from a more sophisticated approach of summarizing the message history using a chat model.\nPrompting and orchestration logic can be used to summarize the message history. For example, in LangGraph you can extend the MessagesState to include a summary key:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\nclass State(MessagesState):\n    summary: str\n\nThen, you can generate a summary of the chat history, using any existing summary as context for the next summary. This summarize_conversation node can be called after some number of messages have accumulated in the messages state key.\nCopy\ndef summarize_conversation(state: State):\n\n    # First, we get any existing summary\n    summary = state.get(\"summary\", \"\")\n\n    # Create our summarization prompt\n    if summary:\n\n        # A summary already exists\n        summary_message = (\n            f\"This is a summary of the conversation to date: {summary}\\n\\n\"\n            \"Extend the summary by taking into account the new messages above:\"\n        )\n\n    else:\n        summary_message = \"Create a summary of the conversation above:\"\n\n    # Add prompt to our history\n    messages = state[\"messages\"] + [HumanMessage(content=summary_message)]\n    response = model.invoke(messages)\n\n    # Delete all but the 2 most recent messages\n    delete_messages = [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in state[\"messages\"][:-2]]\n    return {\"summary\": response.content, \"messages\": delete_messages}\n\n\nFull example: summarize messages\n\n�\nManage checkpoints\nYou can view and delete the information stored by the checkpointer.\n�\nView thread state\nGraph/Functional API\nCheckpointer API\nCopy\nconfig = {\n    \"configurable\": {\n        \"thread_id\": \"1\",  \n        # optionally provide an ID for a specific checkpoint,\n        # otherwise the latest checkpoint is shown\n        # \"checkpoint_id\": \"1f029ca3-1f5b-6704-8004-820c16b69a5a\"  #\n\n    }\n}\ngraph.get_state(config)  \n\nCopy\nStateSnapshot(\n    values={'messages': [HumanMessage(content=\"hi!

However, you should check with your specific implementation of BaseCheckpointSaver or BaseStore to confirm the exact method name and usage.\nWe recommend running migrations as a dedicated deployment step, or you can ensure they’re run as part of server startup.\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

A subgraph is a graph that is used as a node in another graph.\nSubgraphs are useful for:\nBuilding multi-agent systems\nRe-using a set of nodes in multiple graphs\nDistributing development: when you want different teams to work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas) is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the subgraph\n�\nSetup\npip\nuv\nCopy\npip install -U langgraph\n\nSet up LangSmith for LangGraph development Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here.\n�\nDefine subgraph communication\nWhen adding subgraphs, you need to define how the parent graph and the subgraph communicate:\nPattern\tWhen to use\tState schemas\nCall a subgraph inside a node\tParent and subgraph have different state schemas (no shared keys), or you need to transform state between them\tYou write a wrapper function that maps parent state to subgraph input and subgraph output back to parent state\nAdd a subgraph as a node\tParent and subgraph share state keys — the subgraph reads from and writes to the same channels as the parent\tYou pass the compiled subgraph directly to add_node — no wrapper function needed\n�\nCall a subgraph inside a node\nWhen the parent graph and subgraph have different state schemas (no shared keys), invoke the subgraph inside a node function. This is common when you want to keep a private message history for each agent in a multi-agent system.\nThe node function transforms the parent state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and transforms the results back to the parent state before returning.\nCopy\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph, START\n\nclass SubgraphState(TypedDict):\n    bar: str\n\n# Subgraph\n\ndef subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):\n    return {\"bar\": \"hi! \" + state[\"bar\"]}\n\nsubgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)\nsubgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)\nsubgraph_builder.add_edge(START, \"subgraph_node_1\")\nsubgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()\n\n# Parent graph\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n\ndef call_subgraph(state: State):\n    # Transform the state to the subgraph state\n    subgraph_output = subgraph.invoke({\"bar\": state[\"foo\"]})  \n    # Transform response back to the parent state\n    return {\"foo\": subgraph_output[\"bar\"]}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_1\", call_subgraph)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\n\nFull example: different state schemas\n\nFull example: different state schemas (two levels of subgraphs)\n\n�\nAdd a subgraph as a node\nWhen the parent graph and subgraph share state keys, you can pass a compiled subgraph directly to add_node. No wrapper function is needed — the subgraph reads from and writes to the parent’s state channels automatically. For example, in multi-agent systems, the agents often communicate over a shared messages key.\nIf your subgraph shares state keys with the parent graph, you can follow these steps to add it to your graph:\nDefine the subgraph workflow (subgraph_builder in the example below) and compile it\nPass compiled subgraph to the add_node method when defining the parent graph workflow\nCopy\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph, START\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n\n# Subgraph\n\ndef subgraph_node_1(state: State):\n    return {\"foo\": \"hi! \" + state[\"foo\"]}\n\nsubgraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\nsubgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)\nsubgraph_builder.add_edge(START, \"subgraph_node_1\")\nsubgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()\n\n# Parent graph\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_1\", subgraph)  \nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\n\nFull example: shared state schemas\n\n�\nSubgraph persistence\nWhen you use a subgraph, you need to decide what happens to its internal data between calls. Consider a customer support bot that delegates to specialist subagents: should the “billing expert” subagent remember the customer’s earlier questions, or start fresh each time it’s called?\nBy default, subgraphs are stateless (no memory): each call starts with a blank slate. This is the right choice for most applications, including multi-agent systems where subagents handle independent requests. If a subagent needs multi-turn conversation memory (for example, a research assistant that builds context over several exchanges) you can make it stateful (persistent memory) so its conversation history and data accumulate across calls on the same thread.\nThe parent graph must be compiled with a checkpointer for subgraph persistence features (interrupts, state inspection, stateful memory) to work. See persistence.\n�\nStateless\nUse stateless subgraphs when each call to the subgraph is independent and the subagent doesn’t need to remember anything from previous calls. This is the most common pattern, especially for multi-agent systems where subagents handle one-off requests like “look up this customer’s order” or “summarize this document.”\nThere are two stateless options depending on whether you need interrupts (human-in-the-loop pausing) and durable execution within the subgraph.\n�\nWith interrupts\nThis is the recommended mode for most applications, including multi-agent systems where subagents are invoked as tools. It supports interrupts, durable execution, and parallel calls while keeping each invocation isolated.\nUse this when you want a subagent with no memory across calls, but you still need durable execution and the ability to pause mid-run for user input (for example, asking for approval before taking an action). This is the default behavior: omit checkpointer or set it to None. Each call starts fresh, but within a single call, the subgraph can use interrupt() to pause and resume.\nThe following examples use two subagents (fruit expert, veggie expert) wrapped as tools for an outer agent:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n\n@tool\ndef fruit_info(fruit_name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Look up fruit info.\"\"\"\n    return f\"Info about {fruit_name}\"\n\n@tool\ndef veggie_info(veggie_name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Look up veggie info.\"\"\"\n    return f\"Info about {veggie_name}\"\n\n# Subagents — no checkpointer setting (inherits parent)\nfruit_agent = create_agent(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\n    tools=[fruit_info],\n    prompt=\"You are a fruit expert. Use the fruit_info tool. Respond in one sentence.\",\n)\n\nveggie_agent = create_agent(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\n    tools=[veggie_info],\n    prompt=\"You are a veggie expert. Use the veggie_info tool. Respond in one sentence.\",\n)\n\n# Wrap subagents as tools for the outer agent\n@tool\ndef ask_fruit_expert(question: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Ask the fruit expert. Use for ALL fruit questions.\"\"\"\n    response = fruit_agent.invoke(\n        {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": question}]},\n    )\n    return response[\"messages\"][-1].content\n\n@tool\ndef ask_veggie_expert(question: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Ask the veggie expert. Use for ALL veggie questions.\"\"\"\n    response = veggie_agent.invoke(\n        {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": question}]},\n    )\n    return response[\"messages\"][-1].content\n\n# Outer agent with checkpointer\nagent = create_agent(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\n    tools=[ask_fruit_expert, ask_veggie_expert],\n    prompt=(\n        \"You have two experts: ask_fruit_expert and ask_veggie_expert. \"\n        \"ALWAYS delegate questions to the appropriate expert.\"\n    ),\n    checkpointer=MemorySaver(),\n)\n\nInterrupts\nMulti-turn\nMultiple subgraph calls\nEach invocation can use interrupt() to pause and resume. Add interrupt() to a tool function to require user approval before proceeding:\nCopy\n@tool\ndef fruit_info(fruit_name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Look up fruit info.\"\"\"\n    interrupt(\"continue?\")  \n    return f\"Info about {fruit_name}\"\n\nCopy\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n\n# Invoke — the subagent's tool calls interrupt()\nresponse = agent.invoke(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Tell me about apples\"}]},\n    config=config,\n)\n# response contains __interrupt__\n\n# Resume — approve the interrupt\nresponse = agent.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)  \n# Subagent message count: 4\n\n�\nWithout interrupts\nUse this when you want to run a subagent like a normal function call with no checkpointing overhead. The subgraph cannot pause/resume and does not benefit from durable execution. Compile with checkpointer=False.\nWithout checkpointing, the subgraph has no durable execution. If the process crashes mid-run, the subgraph cannot recover and must be re-run from the beginning.\nCopy\nsubgraph_builder = StateGraph(...)\nsubgraph = subgraph_builder.compile(checkpointer=False)  \n\n�\nStateful\nUse stateful subgraphs when a subagent needs to remember previous interactions. For example, a research assistant that builds up context over several exchanges, or a coding assistant that tracks what files it has already edited. With stateful persistence, the subagent’s conversation history and data accumulate across calls on the same thread. Each call picks up where the last one left off.\nCompile with checkpointer=True to enable this behavior.\nStateful subgraphs do not support parallel calls to the same subagent. Because the subagent writes to the same checkpoint namespace every time, two simultaneous calls corrupt each other’s state. You must ensure only one call runs at a time. See Prevent parallel calls to stateful subgraphs below for how to enforce this with middleware, or use stateless with interrupts if you need parallel calls.\nThe following examples use a single fruit expert subagent compiled with checkpointer=True:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n\n@tool\ndef fruit_info(fruit_name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Look up fruit info.\"\"\"\n    return f\"Info about {fruit_name}\"\n\n# Subagent with checkpointer=True for persistent state\nfruit_agent = create_agent(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\n    tools=[fruit_info],\n    prompt=\"You are a fruit expert. Use the fruit_info tool. Respond in one sentence.\",\n    checkpointer=True,  \n)\n\n# Wrap subagent as a tool for the outer agent\n@tool\ndef ask_fruit_expert(question: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Ask the fruit expert. Use for ALL fruit questions.\"\"\"\n    response = fruit_agent.invoke(\n        {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": question}]},\n    )\n    return response[\"messages\"][-1].content\n\n# Outer agent with checkpointer\nagent = create_agent(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\n    tools=[ask_fruit_expert],\n    prompt=\"You have a fruit expert. ALWAYS delegate fruit questions to ask_fruit_expert.\",\n    checkpointer=MemorySaver(),\n)\n\nInterrupts\nMulti-turn\nMultiple subgraph calls\nStateful subagents support interrupt() just like per-invocation.

Each call picks up where the last one left off rather than starting fresh.\nMultiple calls (different subgraphs): Multiple different subgraph instances can be invoked within a single node without checkpoint namespace conflicts.\nMultiple calls (same subgraph): The same subgraph instance can be invoked multiple times within a single node. With stateful persistence, these calls write to the same checkpoint namespace and conflict — use per-invocation persistence instead.\nState inspection: The subgraph’s state is available via get_state(config, subgraphs=True) for debugging and monitoring.\n�\nView subgraph state\nWhen you enable persistence, you can inspect the subgraph state using the subgraphs option. With checkpointer=False, no subgraph checkpoints are saved, so subgraph state is not available.\nViewing subgraph state requires that LangGraph can statically discover the subgraph — i.e., it is added as a node or called inside a node. It does not work when a subgraph is called inside a tool function or other indirection (e.g., the subagents pattern). Interrupts still propagate to the top-level graph regardless of nesting.\nStateless\nStateful\nReturns subgraph state for the current invocation only.

It handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns so you can deploy your stateful, long-running agents directly from your repository. Learn more in the Deployment documentation.\n�\nKey concepts\nTo deploy using the LangSmith, the following information should be provided:\nA LangGraph configuration file (langgraph.json) that specifies the dependencies, graphs, and environment variables to use for the application.\nThe graphs that implement the logic of the application.\nA file that specifies dependencies required to run the application.\nEnvironment variables that are required for the application to run.\n�\nFile structure\nBelow are examples of directory structures for applications:\nPython (requirements.txt)\nPython (pyproject.toml)\nCopy\nmy-app/\n├── my_agent # all project code lies within here\n│   ├── utils # utilities for your graph\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── tools.py # tools for your graph\n│   │   ├── nodes.py # node functions for your graph\n│   │   └── state.py # state definition of your graph\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── agent.py # code for constructing your graph\n├── .env # environment variables\n├── requirements.txt # package dependencies\n└── langgraph.json # configuration file for LangGraph\n\nThe directory structure of a LangGraph application can vary depending on the programming language and the package manager used.\n�\nConfiguration file\nThe langgraph.json file is a JSON file that specifies the dependencies, graphs, environment variables, and other settings required to deploy a LangGraph application.\nSee the LangGraph configuration file reference for details on all supported keys in the JSON file.\nThe LangGraph CLI defaults to using the configuration file langgraph.json in the current directory.\n�\nExamples\nThe dependencies involve a custom local package and the langchain_openai package.\nA single graph will be loaded from the file ./your_package/your_file.py with the variable variable.\nThe environment variables are loaded from the .env file.\nCopy\n{\n  \"dependencies\": [\"langchain_openai\", \"./your_package\"],\n  \"graphs\": {\n    \"my_agent\": \"./your_package/your_file.py:agent\"\n  },\n  \"env\": \"./.env\"\n}\n\n�\nDependencies\nA LangGraph application may depend on other Python packages.\nYou will generally need to specify the following information for dependencies to be set up correctly:\nA file in the directory that specifies the dependencies (e.g. requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or package.json).\nA dependencies key in the LangGraph configuration file that specifies the dependencies required to run the LangGraph application.\nAny additional binaries or system libraries can be specified using dockerfile_lines key in the LangGraph configuration file.\n�\nGraphs\nUse the graphs key in the LangGraph configuration file to specify which graphs will be available in the deployed LangGraph application.\nYou can specify one or more graphs in the configuration file. Each graph is identified by a name (which should be unique) and a path for either: (1) the compiled graph or (2) a function that makes a graph is defined.\n�\nEnvironment variables\nIf you’re working with a deployed LangGraph application locally, you can configure environment variables in the env key of the LangGraph configuration file.\nFor a production deployment, you will typically want to configure the environment variables in the deployment environment.\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

This guide covers some useful patterns you can use when writing unit tests.\nNote that this guide is LangGraph-specific and covers scenarios around graphs with custom structures - if you are just getting started, check out this section that uses LangChain’s built-in create_agent instead.\n�\nPrerequisites\nFirst, make sure you have pytest installed:\nCopy\n$ pip install -U pytest\n\n�\nGetting started\nBecause many LangGraph agents depend on state, a useful pattern is to create your graph before each test where you use it, then compile it within tests with a new checkpointer instance.\nThe below example shows how this works with a simple, linear graph that progresses through node1 and node2. Each node updates the single state key my_key:\nCopy\nimport pytest\n\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n\ndef create_graph() -> StateGraph:\n    class MyState(TypedDict):\n        my_key: str\n\n    graph = StateGraph(MyState)\n    graph.add_node(\"node1\", lambda state: {\"my_key\": \"hello from node1\"})\n    graph.add_node(\"node2\", lambda state: {\"my_key\": \"hello from node2\"})\n    graph.add_edge(START, \"node1\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"node1\", \"node2\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"node2\", END)\n    return graph\n\ndef test_basic_agent_execution() -> None:\n    checkpointer = MemorySaver()\n    graph = create_graph()\n    compiled_graph = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    result = compiled_graph.invoke(\n        {\"my_key\": \"initial_value\"},\n        config={\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n    )\n    assert result[\"my_key\"] == \"hello from node2\"\n\n�\nTesting individual nodes and edges\nCompiled LangGraph agents expose references to each individual node as graph.nodes. You can take advantage of this to test individual nodes within your agent. Note that this will bypass any checkpointers passed when compiling the graph:\nCopy\nimport pytest\n\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n\ndef create_graph() -> StateGraph:\n    class MyState(TypedDict):\n        my_key: str\n\n    graph = StateGraph(MyState)\n    graph.add_node(\"node1\", lambda state: {\"my_key\": \"hello from node1\"})\n    graph.add_node(\"node2\", lambda state: {\"my_key\": \"hello from node2\"})\n    graph.add_edge(START, \"node1\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"node1\", \"node2\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"node2\", END)\n    return graph\n\ndef test_individual_node_execution() -> None:\n    # Will be ignored in this example\n    checkpointer = MemorySaver()\n    graph = create_graph()\n    compiled_graph = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    # Only invoke node 1\n    result = compiled_graph.nodes[\"node1\"].invoke(\n        {\"my_key\": \"initial_value\"},\n    )\n    assert result[\"my_key\"] == \"hello from node1\"\n\n�\nPartial execution\nFor agents made up of larger graphs, you may wish to test partial execution paths within your agent rather than the entire flow end-to-end. In some cases, it may make semantic sense to restructure these sections as subgraphs, which you can invoke in isolation as normal.\nHowever, if you do not wish to make changes to your agent graph’s overall structure, you can use LangGraph’s persistence mechanisms to simulate a state where your agent is paused right before the beginning of the desired section, and will pause again at the end of the desired section. The steps are as follows:\nCompile your agent with a checkpointer (the in-memory checkpointer InMemorySaver will suffice for testing).\nCall your agent’s update_state method with an as_node parameter set to the name of the node before the one you want to start your test.\nInvoke your agent with the same thread_id you used to update the state and an interrupt_after parameter set to the name of the node you want to stop at.\nHere’s an example that executes only the second and third nodes in a linear graph:\nCopy\nimport pytest\n\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n\ndef create_graph() -> StateGraph:\n    class MyState(TypedDict):\n        my_key: str\n\n    graph = StateGraph(MyState)\n    graph.add_node(\"node1\", lambda state: {\"my_key\": \"hello from node1\"})\n    graph.add_node(\"node2\", lambda state: {\"my_key\": \"hello from node2\"})\n    graph.add_node(\"node3\", lambda state: {\"my_key\": \"hello from node3\"})\n    graph.add_node(\"node4\", lambda state: {\"my_key\": \"hello from node4\"})\n    graph.add_edge(START, \"node1\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"node1\", \"node2\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"node2\", \"node3\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"node3\", \"node4\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"node4\", END)\n    return graph\n\ndef test_partial_execution_from_node2_to_node3() -> None:\n    checkpointer = MemorySaver()\n    graph = create_graph()\n    compiled_graph = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    compiled_graph.update_state(\n        config={\n          \"configurable\": {\n            \"thread_id\": \"1\"\n          }\n        },\n        # The state passed into node 2 - simulating the state at\n        # the end of node 1\n        values={\"my_key\": \"initial_value\"},\n        # Update saved state as if it came from node 1\n        # Execution will resume at node 2\n        as_node=\"node1\",\n    )\n    result = compiled_graph.invoke(\n        # Resume execution by passing None\n        None,\n        config={\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}},\n        # Stop after node 3 so that node 4 doesn't run\n        interrupt_after=\"node3\",\n    )\n    assert result[\"my_key\"] == \"hello from node3\"\n\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

LangSmith Studio is a free visual interface for developing and testing your LangChain agents from your local machine.\nStudio connects to your locally running agent to show you each step your agent takes: the prompts sent to the model, tool calls and their results, and the final output. You can test different inputs, inspect intermediate states, and iterate on your agent’s behavior without additional code or deployment.\nThis pages describes how to set up Studio with your local LangChain agent.\n�\nPrerequisites\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\nA LangSmith account: Sign up (for free) or log in at smith.langchain.com.\nA LangSmith API key: Follow the Create an API key guide.\nIf you don’t want data traced to LangSmith, set LANGSMITH_TRACING=false in your application’s .env file. With tracing disabled, no data leaves your local server.\n�\nSet up local Agent server\n�\n1. Install the LangGraph CLI\nThe LangGraph CLI provides a local development server (also called Agent Server) that connects your agent to Studio.\nCopy\n# Python >= 3.11 is required.\npip install --upgrade \"langgraph-cli[inmem]\"\n\n�\n2. Prepare your agent\nIf you already have a LangChain agent, you can use it directly. This example uses a simple email agent:\nagent.py\nCopy\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\n\ndef send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):\n    \"\"\"Send an email\"\"\"\n    email = {\n        \"to\": to,\n        \"subject\": subject,\n        \"body\": body\n    }\n    # ... email sending logic\n\n    return f\"Email sent to {to}\"\n\nagent = create_agent(\n    \"gpt-4.1\",\n    tools=[send_email],\n    system_prompt=\"You are an email assistant. Always use the send_email tool.\",\n)\n\n�\n3. Environment variables\nStudio requires a LangSmith API key to connect your local agent. Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your API key from LangSmith.\nEnsure your .env file is not committed to version control, such as Git.\n.env\nCopy\nLANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2...\n\n�\n4. Create a LangGraph config file\nThe LangGraph CLI uses a configuration file to locate your agent and manage dependencies. Create a langgraph.json file in your app’s directory:\nlanggraph.json\nCopy\n{\n  \"dependencies\": [\".\"],\n  \"graphs\": {\n    \"agent\": \"./src/agent.py:agent\"\n  },\n  \"env\": \".env\"\n}\n\nThe create_agent function automatically returns a compiled LangGraph graph, which is what the graphs key expects in the configuration file.\nFor detailed explanations of each key in the JSON object of the configuration file, refer to the LangGraph configuration file reference.\nAt this point, the project structure will look like this:\nCopy\nmy-app/\n├── src\n│   └── agent.py\n├── .env\n└── langgraph.json\n\n�\n5. Install dependencies\nInstall your project dependencies from the root directory:\npip\nuv\nCopy\npip install langchain langchain-openai\n\n�\n6. View your agent in Studio\nStart the development server to connect your agent to Studio:\nCopy\nlanggraph dev\n\nSafari blocks localhost connections to Studio. To work around this, run the above command with --tunnel to access Studio via a secure tunnel. You’ll need to manually add the tunnel URL to allowed origins by clicking Connect to a local server in the Studio UI. See the troubleshooting guide for steps.\nOnce the server is running, your agent is accessible both via API at http://127.0.0.1:2024 and through the Studio UI at https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024:\nWith Studio connected to your local agent, you can iterate quickly on your agent’s behavior. Run a test input, inspect the full execution trace including prompts, tool arguments, return values, and token/latency metrics in LangSmith. When something goes wrong, Studio captures exceptions with the surrounding state to help you understand what happened.\nThe development server supports hot-reloading—make changes to prompts or tool signatures in your code, and Studio reflects them immediately. Re-run conversation threads from any step to test your changes without starting over. This workflow scales from simple single-tool agents to complex multi-node graphs.\nFor more information on how to run Studio, refer to the following guides in the LangSmith docs:\nRun application\nManage assistants\nManage threads\nIterate on prompts\nDebug LangSmith traces\nAdd node to dataset\n�\nVideo guide\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

Each of these individual steps is represented by a run. You can use LangSmith to visualize these execution steps. To use it, enable tracing for your application. This enables you to do the following:\nDebug a locally running application.\nEvaluate the application performance.\nMonitor the application.\n�\nPrerequisites\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\nA LangSmith account: Sign up (for free) or log in at smith.langchain.com.\nA LangSmith API key: Follow the Create an API key guide.\n�\nEnable tracing\nTo enable tracing for your application, set the following environment variables:\nCopy\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=true\nexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\n\nBy default, the trace will be logged to the project with the name default. To configure a custom project name, see Log to a project.\nFor more information, see Trace with LangGraph.\n�\nTrace selectively\nYou may opt to trace specific invocations or parts of your application using LangSmith’s tracing_context context manager:\nCopy\nimport langsmith as ls\n\n# This WILL be traced\nwith ls.tracing_context(enabled=True):\n    agent.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Send a test email to alice@example.com\"}]})\n\n# This will NOT be traced (if LANGSMITH_TRACING is not set)\nagent.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Send another email\"}]})\n\n�\nLog to a project\n\nStatically\n\nDynamically\n\n�\nAdd metadata to traces\nYou can annotate your traces with custom metadata and tags:\nCopy\nresponse = agent.invoke(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Send a welcome email\"}]},\n    config={\n        \"tags\": [\"production\", \"email-assistant\", \"v1.0\"],\n        \"metadata\": {\n            \"user_id\": \"user_123\",\n            \"session_id\": \"session_456\",\n            \"environment\": \"production\"\n        }\n    }\n)\n\ntracing_context also accepts tags and metadata for fine-grained control:\nCopy\nwith ls.tracing_context(\n    project_name=\"email-agent-test\",\n    enabled=True,\n    tags=[\"production\", \"email-assistant\", \"v1.0\"],\n    metadata={\"user_id\": \"user_123\", \"session_id\": \"session_456\", \"environment\": \"production\"}):\n    response = agent.invoke(\n        {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Send a welcome email\"}]}\n    )\n\nThis custom metadata and tags will be attached to the trace in LangSmith.\nTo learn more about how to use traces to debug, evaluate, and monitor your agents, see the LangSmith documentation.\n�\nUse anonymizers to prevent logging of sensitive data in traces\nYou may want to mask sensitive data to prevent it from being logged to LangSmith. You can create anonymizers and apply them to your graph using configuration. This example will redact anything matching the Social Security Number format XXX-XX-XXXX from traces sent to LangSmith.\nPython\nCopy\nfrom langchain_core.tracers.langchain import LangChainTracer\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState\nfrom langsmith import Client\nfrom langsmith.anonymizer import create_anonymizer\n\nanonymizer = create_anonymizer([\n    # Matches SSNs\n    { \"pattern\": r\"\\b\\d{3}-?\\d{2}-?\\d{4}\\b\", \"replace\": \"<ssn>\" }\n])\n\ntracer_client = Client(anonymizer=anonymizer)\ntracer = LangChainTracer(client=tracer_client)\n# Define the graph\ngraph = (\n    StateGraph(MessagesState)\n    ...\n    .compile()\n    .with_config({'callbacks': [tracer]})\n)\n\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

Both APIs share the same underlying runtime and can be used together in the same application, but they are designed for different use cases and development preferences.\nThis guide will help you understand when to use each API based on your specific requirements.\n�\nQuick decision guide\nUse the Graph API when you need:\nComplex workflow visualization for debugging and documentation\nExplicit state management with shared data across multiple nodes\nConditional branching with multiple decision points\nParallel execution paths that need to merge later\nTeam collaboration where visual representation aids understanding\nUse the Functional API when you want:\nMinimal code changes to existing procedural code\nStandard control flow (if/else, loops, function calls)\nFunction-scoped state without explicit state management\nRapid prototyping with less boilerplate\nLinear workflows with simple branching logic\n�\nDetailed comparison\n�\nWhen to use the Graph API\nThe Graph API uses a declarative approach where you define nodes, edges, and shared state to create a visual graph structure.\n1. Complex decision trees and branching logic\nWhen your workflow has multiple decision points that depend on various conditions, the Graph API makes these branches explicit and easy to visualize.\nCopy\n# Graph API: Clear visualization of decision paths\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nclass AgentState(TypedDict):\n    messages: list\n    current_tool: str\n    retry_count: int\n\ndef should_continue(state):\n    if state[\"retry_count\"] > 3:\n        return \"end\"\n    elif state[\"current_tool\"] == \"search\":\n        return \"process_search\"\n    else:\n        return \"call_llm\"\n\nworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)\nworkflow.add_node(\"call_llm\", call_llm_node)\nworkflow.add_node(\"process_search\", search_node)\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\"call_llm\", should_continue)\n\n2. State management across multiple components\nWhen you need to share and coordinate state between different parts of your workflow, the Graph API’s explicit state management is beneficial.\nCopy\n# Multiple nodes can access and modify shared state\nclass WorkflowState(TypedDict):\n    user_input: str\n    search_results: list\n    generated_response: str\n    validation_status: str\n\ndef search_node(state):\n    # Access shared state\n    results = search(state[\"user_input\"])\n    return {\"search_results\": results}\n\ndef validation_node(state):\n    # Access results from previous node\n    is_valid = validate(state[\"generated_response\"])\n    return {\"validation_status\": \"valid\" if is_valid else \"invalid\"}\n\n3. Parallel processing with synchronization\nWhen you need to run multiple operations in parallel and then combine their results, the Graph API handles this naturally.\nCopy\n# Parallel processing of multiple data sources\nworkflow.add_node(\"fetch_news\", fetch_news)\nworkflow.add_node(\"fetch_weather\", fetch_weather)\nworkflow.add_node(\"fetch_stocks\", fetch_stocks)\nworkflow.add_node(\"combine_data\", combine_all_data)\n\n# All fetch operations run in parallel\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"fetch_news\")\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"fetch_weather\")\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"fetch_stocks\")\n\n# Combine waits for all parallel operations to complete\nworkflow.add_edge(\"fetch_news\", \"combine_data\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"fetch_weather\", \"combine_data\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"fetch_stocks\", \"combine_data\")\n\n4. Team development and documentation\nThe visual nature of the Graph API makes it easier for teams to understand, document, and maintain complex workflows.\nCopy\n# Clear separation of concerns - each team member can work on different nodes\nworkflow.add_node(\"data_ingestion\", data_team_function)\nworkflow.add_node(\"ml_processing\", ml_team_function)\nworkflow.add_node(\"business_logic\", product_team_function)\nworkflow.add_node(\"output_formatting\", frontend_team_function)\n\n�\nWhen to use the Functional API\nThe Functional API uses an imperative approach that integrates LangGraph features into standard procedural code.\n1. Existing procedural code\nWhen you have existing code that uses standard control flow and want to add LangGraph features with minimal refactoring.\nCopy\n# Functional API: Minimal changes to existing code\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint, task\n\n@task\ndef process_user_input(user_input: str) -> dict:\n    # Existing function with minimal changes\n    return {\"processed\": user_input.lower().strip()}\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef workflow(user_input: str) -> str:\n    # Standard Python control flow\n    processed = process_user_input(user_input).result()\n\n    if \"urgent\" in processed[\"processed\"]:\n        response = handle_urgent_request(processed).result()\n    else:\n        response = handle_normal_request(processed).result()\n\n    return response\n\n2. Linear workflows with simple logic\nWhen your workflow is primarily sequential with straightforward conditional logic.\nCopy\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef essay_workflow(topic: str) -> dict:\n    # Linear flow with simple branching\n    outline = create_outline(topic).result()\n\n    if len(outline[\"points\"]) < 3:\n        outline = expand_outline(outline).result()\n\n    draft = write_draft(outline).result()\n\n    # Human review checkpoint\n    feedback = interrupt({\"draft\": draft, \"action\": \"Please review\"})\n\n    if feedback == \"approve\":\n        final_essay = draft\n    else:\n        final_essay = revise_essay(draft, feedback).result()\n\n    return {\"essay\": final_essay}\n\n3. Rapid prototyping\nWhen you want to quickly test ideas without the overhead of defining state schemas and graph structures.\nCopy\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef quick_prototype(data: dict) -> dict:\n    # Fast iteration - no state schema needed\n    step1_result = process_step1(data).result()\n    step2_result = process_step2(step1_result).result()\n\n    return {\"final_result\": step2_result}\n\n4. Function-scoped state management\nWhen your state is naturally scoped to individual functions and doesn’t need to be shared broadly.\nCopy\n@task\ndef analyze_document(document: str) -> dict:\n    # Local state management within function\n    sections = extract_sections(document)\n    summaries = [summarize(section) for section in sections]\n    key_points = extract_key_points(summaries)\n\n    return {\n        \"sections\": len(sections),\n        \"summaries\": summaries,\n        \"key_points\": key_points\n    }\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef document_processor(document: str) -> dict:\n    analysis = analyze_document(document).result()\n    # State is passed between functions as needed\n    return generate_report(analysis).result()\n\n�\nCombining both APIs\nYou can use both APIs together in the same application. This is useful when different parts of your system have different requirements.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint\n\n# Complex multi-agent coordination using Graph API\ncoordination_graph = StateGraph(CoordinationState)\ncoordination_graph.add_node(\"orchestrator\", orchestrator_node)\ncoordination_graph.add_node(\"agent_a\", agent_a_node)\ncoordination_graph.add_node(\"agent_b\", agent_b_node)\n\n# Simple data processing using Functional API\n@entrypoint()\ndef data_processor(raw_data: dict) -> dict:\n    cleaned = clean_data(raw_data).result()\n    transformed = transform_data(cleaned).result()\n    return transformed\n\n# Use the functional API result in the graph\ndef orchestrator_node(state):\n    processed_data = data_processor.invoke(state[\"raw_data\"])\n    return {\"processed_data\": processed_data}\n\n�\nMigration between APIs\n�\nFrom Functional to Graph API\nWhen your functional workflow grows complex, you can migrate to the Graph API:\nCopy\n# Before: Functional API\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef complex_workflow(input_data: dict) -> dict:\n    step1 = process_step1(input_data).result()\n\n    if step1[\"needs_analysis\"]:\n        analysis = analyze_data(step1).result()\n        if analysis[\"confidence\"] > 0.8:\n            result = high_confidence_path(analysis).result()\n        else:\n            result = low_confidence_path(analysis).result()\n    else:\n        result = simple_path(step1).result()\n\n    return result\n\n# After: Graph API\nclass WorkflowState(TypedDict):\n    input_data: dict\n    step1_result: dict\n    analysis: dict\n    final_result: dict\n\ndef should_analyze(state):\n    return \"analyze\" if state[\"step1_result\"][\"needs_analysis\"] else \"simple_path\"\n\ndef confidence_check(state):\n    return \"high_confidence\" if state[\"analysis\"][\"confidence\"] > 0.8 else \"low_confidence\"\n\nworkflow = StateGraph(WorkflowState)\nworkflow.add_node(\"step1\", process_step1_node)\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\"step1\", should_analyze)\nworkflow.add_node(\"analyze\", analyze_data_node)\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\"analyze\", confidence_check)\n# ... add remaining nodes and edges\n\n�\nFrom Graph to Functional API\nWhen your graph becomes overly complex for simple linear processes:\nCopy\n# Before: Over-engineered Graph API\nclass SimpleState(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    step1: str\n    step2: str\n    result: str\n\n# After: Simplified Functional API\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef simple_workflow(input_data: str) -> str:\n    step1 = process_step1(input_data).result()\n    step2 = process_step2(step1).result()\n    return finalize_result(step2).result()\n\n�\nSummary\nChoose the Graph API when you need explicit control over workflow structure, complex branching, parallel processing, or team collaboration benefits.\nChoose the Functional API when you want to add LangGraph features to existing code with minimal changes, have simple linear workflows, or need rapid prototyping capabilities.\nBoth APIs provide the same core LangGraph features (persistence, streaming, human-in-the-loop, memory) but package them in different paradigms to suit different development styles and use cases.\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

Unlike many data orchestration frameworks that require restructuring code into an explicit pipeline or DAG, the Functional API allows you to incorporate these capabilities without enforcing a rigid execution model.\nThe Functional API uses two key building blocks:\n@entrypoint – Marks a function as the starting point of a workflow, encapsulating logic and managing execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.\n@task – Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.\nThis provides a minimal abstraction for building workflows with state management and streaming.\nFor information on how to use the functional API, see Use Functional API.\n�\nFunctional API vs. Graph API\nFor users who prefer a more declarative approach, LangGraph’s Graph API allows you to define workflows using a Graph paradigm. Both APIs share the same underlying runtime, so you can use them together in the same application.\nHere are some key differences:\nControl flow: The Functional API does not require thinking about graph structure. You can use standard Python constructs to define workflows. This will usually trim the amount of code you need to write.\nShort-term memory: The GraphAPI requires declaring a State and may require defining reducers to manage updates to the graph state. @entrypoint and @tasks do not require explicit state management as their state is scoped to the function and is not shared across functions.\nCheckpointing: Both APIs generate and use checkpoints. In the Graph API a new checkpoint is generated after every superstep. In the Functional API, when tasks are executed, their results are saved to an existing checkpoint associated with the given entrypoint instead of creating a new checkpoint.\nVisualization: The Graph API makes it easy to visualize the workflow as a graph which can be useful for debugging, understanding the workflow, and sharing with others. The Functional API does not support visualization as the graph is dynamically generated during runtime.\n�\nExample\nBelow we demonstrate a simple application that writes an essay and interrupts to request human review.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint, task\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\n@task\ndef write_essay(topic: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Write an essay about the given topic.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(1) # A placeholder for a long-running task.\n    return f\"An essay about topic: {topic}\"\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\ndef workflow(topic: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review.\"\"\"\n    essay = write_essay(\"cat\").result()\n    is_approved = interrupt({\n        # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.\n        # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data\n        # from the workflow.\n        \"essay\": essay, # The essay we want reviewed.\n        # We can add any additional information that we need.\n        # For example, introduce a key called \"action\" with some instructions.\n        \"action\": \"Please approve/reject the essay\",\n    })\n\n    return {\n        \"essay\": essay, # The essay that was generated\n        \"is_approved\": is_approved, # Response from HIL\n    }\n\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\n�\nEntrypoint\nThe @entrypoint decorator can be used to create a workflow from a function. It encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.\n�\nDefinition\nAn entrypoint is defined by decorating a function with the @entrypoint decorator.\nThe function must accept a single positional argument, which serves as the workflow input. If you need to pass multiple pieces of data, use a dictionary as the input type for the first argument.\nDecorating a function with an entrypoint produces a Pregel instance which helps to manage the execution of the workflow (e.g., handles streaming, resumption, and checkpointing).\nYou will usually want to pass a checkpointer to the @entrypoint decorator to enable persistence and use features like human-in-the-loop.\nSync\nAsync\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:\n    # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,\n    # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop.\n    ...\n    return result\n\nSerialization The inputs and outputs of entrypoints must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing. Please see the serialization section for more details.\n�\nInjectable parameters\nWhen declaring an entrypoint, you can request access to additional parameters that will be injected automatically at runtime. These parameters include:\nParameter\tDescription\nprevious\tAccess the state associated with the previous checkpoint for the given thread. See short-term-memory.\nstore\tAn instance of [BaseStore][langgraph.store.base.BaseStore]. Useful for long-term memory.\nwriter\tUse to access the StreamWriter when working with Async Python < 3.11.

The type annotation is entrypoint.final[return_type, save_type].\nCopy\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(number: int, *, previous: Any = None) -> entrypoint.final[int, int]:\n    previous = previous or 0\n    # This will return the previous value to the caller, saving\n    # 2 * number to the checkpoint, which will be used in the next invocation\n    # for the `previous` parameter.\n    return entrypoint.final(value=previous, save=2 * number)\n\nconfig = {\n    \"configurable\": {\n        \"thread_id\": \"1\"\n    }\n}\n\nmy_workflow.invoke(3, config)  # 0 (previous was None)\nmy_workflow.invoke(1, config)  # 6 (previous was 3 * 2 from the previous invocation)\n\n�\nTask\nA task represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step. It has two key characteristics:\nAsynchronous Execution: Tasks are designed to be executed asynchronously, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking.\nCheckpointing: Task results are saved to a checkpoint, enabling resumption of the workflow from the last saved state. (See persistence for more details).\n�\nDefinition\nTasks are defined using the @task decorator, which wraps a regular Python function.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.func import task\n\n@task()\ndef slow_computation(input_value):\n    # Simulate a long-running operation\n    ...\n    return result\n\nSerialization The outputs of tasks must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.\n�\nExecution\nTasks can only be called from within an entrypoint, another task, or a state graph node.\nTasks cannot be called directly from the main application code.\nWhen you call a task, it returns immediately with a future object. A future is a placeholder for a result that will be available later.\nTo obtain the result of a task, you can either wait for it synchronously (using result()) or await it asynchronously (using await).\nSynchronous Invocation\nAsynchronous Invocation\nCopy\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:\n    future = slow_computation(some_input)\n    return future.result()  # Wait for the result synchronously\n\n�\nWhen to use a task\nTasks are useful in the following scenarios:\nCheckpointing: When you need to save the result of a long-running operation to a checkpoint, so you don’t need to recompute it when resuming the workflow.\nHuman-in-the-loop: If you’re building a workflow that requires human intervention, you MUST use tasks to encapsulate any randomness (e.g., API calls) to ensure that the workflow can be resumed correctly. See the determinism section for more details.\nParallel Execution: For I/O-bound tasks, tasks enable parallel execution, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking (e.g., calling multiple APIs).\nObservability: Wrapping operations in tasks provides a way to track the progress of the workflow and monitor the execution of individual operations using LangSmith.\nRetryable Work: When work needs to be retried to handle failures or inconsistencies, tasks provide a way to encapsulate and manage the retry logic.\n�\nSerialization\nThere are two key aspects to serialization in LangGraph:\nentrypoint inputs and outputs must be JSON-serializable.\ntask outputs must be JSON-serializable.\nThese requirements are necessary for enabling checkpointing and workflow resumption. Use python primitives like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, and booleans to ensure that your inputs and outputs are serializable.\nSerialization ensures that workflow state, such as task results and intermediate values, can be reliably saved and restored. This is critical for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.\nProviding non-serializable inputs or outputs will result in a runtime error when a workflow is configured with a checkpointer.\n�\nDeterminism\nTo utilize features like human-in-the-loop, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of tasks. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same sequence of steps, even if task results are non-deterministic.\nLangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting task and subgraph results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the same sequence of steps, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running tasks or tasks with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same.\nWhile different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a specific run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up task and subgraph results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.\n�\nIdempotency\nIdempotency ensures that running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. This helps prevent duplicate API calls and redundant processing if a step is rerun due to a failure. Always place API calls inside tasks functions for checkpointing, and design them to be idempotent in case of re-execution. Re-execution can occur if a task starts, but does not complete successfully. Then, if the workflow is resumed, the task will run again. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid duplication.\n�\nCommon pitfalls\n�\nHandling side effects\nEncapsulate side effects (e.g., writing to a file, sending an email) in tasks to ensure they are not executed multiple times when resuming a workflow.\nIncorrect\nCorrect\nIn this example, a side effect (writing to a file) is directly included in the workflow, so it will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.\nCopy\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\n    # This code will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.\n    # Which is likely not what you want.\n    with open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as f:  \n        f.write(\"Side effect executed\")  \n    value = interrupt(\"question\")\n    return value\n\n�\nNon-deterministic control flow\nOperations that might give different results each time (like getting current time or random numbers) should be encapsulated in tasks to ensure that on resume, the same result is returned.\nIn a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → (returns 5 again) → …\nNot in a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → get new random number (7) → …\nThis is especially important when using human-in-the-loop workflows with multiple interrupt calls. LangGraph keeps a list of resume values for each task/entrypoint. When an interrupt is encountered, it’s matched with the corresponding resume value. This matching is strictly index-based, so the order of the resume values should match the order of the interrupts.\nIf order of execution is not maintained when resuming, one interrupt call may be matched with the wrong resume value, leading to incorrect results.\nPlease read the section on determinism for more details.\nIncorrect\nCorrect\nIn this example, the workflow uses the current time to determine which task to execute. This is non-deterministic because the result of the workflow depends on the time at which it is executed.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\n    t0 = inputs[\"t0\"]\n    t1 = time.time()  \n\n    delta_t = t1 - t0\n\n    if delta_t > 1:\n        result = slow_task(1).result()\n        value = interrupt(\"question\")\n    else:\n        result = slow_task(2).result()\n        value = interrupt(\"question\")\n\n    return {\n        \"result\": result,\n        \"value\": value\n    }\n\n�\nLearn more\nHow to use the Functional API\nGraph API conceptual overview\nChoosing between Graph API and Functional API\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:\nState: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any data type, but is typically defined using a shared state schema.\nNodes: Functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current state as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated state.\nEdges: Functions that determine which Node to execute next based on the current state. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.\nBy composing Nodes and Edges, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the state over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that state.\nTo emphasize: Nodes and Edges are nothing more than functions – they can contain an LLM or just good ol’ code.\nIn short: nodes do the work, edges tell what to do next.\nLangGraph’s underlying graph algorithm uses message passing to define a general program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. Inspired by Google’s Pregel system, the program proceeds in discrete “super-steps.”\nA super-step can be considered a single iteration over the graph nodes. Nodes that run in parallel are part of the same super-step, while nodes that run sequentially belong to separate super-steps. At the start of graph execution, all nodes begin in an inactive state. A node becomes active when it receives a new message (state) on any of its incoming edges (or “channels”). The active node then runs its function and responds with updates. At the end of each super-step, nodes with no incoming messages vote to halt by marking themselves as inactive. The graph execution terminates when all nodes are inactive and no messages are in transit.\n�\nStateGraph\nThe StateGraph class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by a user defined State object.\n�\nCompiling your graph\nTo build your graph, you first define the state, you then add nodes and edges, and then you compile it. What exactly is compiling your graph and why is it needed?\nCompiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where you can specify runtime args like checkpointers and breakpoints. You compile your graph by just calling the .compile method:\nCopy\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(...)\n\nYou MUST compile your graph before you can use it.\n�\nState\nThe first thing you do when you define a graph is define the State of the graph. The State consists of the schema of the graph as well as reducer functions which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the State will be the input schema to all Nodes and Edges in the graph, and can be either a TypedDict or a Pydantic model. All Nodes will emit updates to the State which are then applied using the specified reducer function.\n�\nSchema\nThe main documented way to specify the schema of a graph is by using a TypedDict. If you want to provide default values in your state, use a dataclass. We also support using a Pydantic BaseModel as your graph state if you want recursive data validation (though note that Pydantic is less performant than a TypedDict or dataclass).\nBy default, the graph will have the same input and output schemas. If you want to change this, you can also specify explicit input and output schemas directly. This is useful when you have a lot of keys, and some are explicitly for input and others for output. See the guide for more information.\nThe higher-level create_agent factory in langchain does not support Pydantic state schemas.\n�\nMultiple schemas\nTypically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want more control over this:\nInternal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph’s input / output.\nWe may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key.\nIt is possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal node communication. We can simply define a private schema, PrivateState.\nIt is also possible to define explicit input and output schemas for a graph. In these cases, we define an “internal” schema that contains all keys relevant to graph operations. But, we also define input and output schemas that are sub-sets of the “internal” schema to constrain the input and output of the graph. See this guide for more detail.\nLet’s look at an example:\nCopy\nclass InputState(TypedDict):\n    user_input: str\n\nclass OutputState(TypedDict):\n    graph_output: str\n\nclass OverallState(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n    user_input: str\n    graph_output: str\n\nclass PrivateState(TypedDict):\n    bar: str\n\ndef node_1(state: InputState) -> OverallState:\n    # Write to OverallState\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"user_input\"] + \" name\"}\n\ndef node_2(state: OverallState) -> PrivateState:\n    # Read from OverallState, write to PrivateState\n    return {\"bar\": state[\"foo\"] + \" is\"}\n\ndef node_3(state: PrivateState) -> OutputState:\n    # Read from PrivateState, write to OutputState\n    return {\"graph_output\": state[\"bar\"] + \" Lance\"}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState,input_schema=InputState,output_schema=OutputState)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_1\", node_1)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_2\", node_2)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_3\", node_3)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_1\", \"node_2\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_2\", \"node_3\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_3\", END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\ngraph.invoke({\"user_input\":\"My\"})\n# {'graph_output': 'My name is Lance'}\n\nThere are two subtle and important points to note here:\nWe pass state: InputState as the input schema to node_1. But, we write out to foo, a channel in OverallState. How can we write out to a state channel that is not included in the input schema? This is because a node can write to any state channel in the graph state. The graph state is the union of the state channels defined at initialization, which includes OverallState and the filters InputState and OutputState.\nWe initialize the graph with:\nCopy\nStateGraph(\n    OverallState,\n    input_schema=InputState,\n    output_schema=OutputState\n)\n\nSo, how can we write to PrivateState in node_2? How does the graph gain access to this schema if it was not passed in the StateGraph initialization?\nWe can do this because _nodes can also declare additional state channels_ as long as the state schema definition exists. In this case, the PrivateState schema is defined, so we can add bar as a new state channel in the graph and write to it.\n�\nReducers\nReducers are key to understanding how updates from nodes are applied to the State. Each key in the State has its own independent reducer function. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to that key should override it. There are a few different types of reducers, starting with the default type of reducer:\n�\nDefault reducer\nThese two examples show how to use the default reducer:\nExample A\nCopy\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: int\n    bar: list[str]\n\nIn this example, no reducer functions are specified for any key. Let’s assume the input to the graph is:\n{\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. Let’s then assume the first Node returns {\"foo\": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. If the second node returns {\"bar\": [\"bye\"]} then the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"bye\"]}\nExample B\nCopy\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom operator import add\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: int\n    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]\n\nIn this example, we’ve used the Annotated type to specify a reducer function (operator.add) for the second key (bar). Note that the first key remains unchanged. Let’s assume the input to the graph is {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. Let’s then assume the first Node returns {\"foo\": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. If the second node returns {\"bar\": [\"bye\"]} then the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\", \"bye\"]}. Notice here that the bar key is updated by adding the two lists together.\n�\nOverwrite\nIn some cases, you may want to bypass a reducer and directly overwrite a state value. LangGraph provides the Overwrite type for this purpose. Learn how to use Overwrite here.\n�\nWorking with messages in graph state\n�\nWhy use messages?\nMost modern LLM providers have a chat model interface that accepts a list of messages as input. LangChain’s chat model interface in particular accepts a list of message objects as inputs. These messages come in a variety of forms such as HumanMessage (user input) or AIMessage (LLM response).\nTo read more about what message objects are, please refer to the Messages conceptual guide.\n�\nUsing messages in your graph\nIn many cases, it is helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph state. To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of Message objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see messages key in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how to update the list of Message objects in the state with each state update (for example, when a node sends an update). If you don’t specify a reducer, every state update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value. If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use operator.add as a reducer.\nHowever, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use operator.add, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt add_messages function. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly.\n�\nSerialization\nIn addition to keeping track of message IDs, the add_messages function will also try to deserialize messages into LangChain Message objects whenever a state update is received on the messages channel.\nSee more information on LangChain serialization/deserialization here. This allows sending graph inputs / state updates in the following format:\nCopy\n# this is supported\n{\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"message\")]}\n\n# and this is also supported\n{\"messages\": [{\"type\": \"human\", \"content\": \"message\"}]}\n\nSince the state updates are always deserialized into LangChain Messages when using add_messages, you should use dot notation to access message attributes, like state[\"messages\"][-1].content.\nBelow is an example of a graph that uses add_messages as its reducer function.\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import AnyMessage\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass GraphState(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]\n\n�\nMessagesState\nSince having a list of messages in your state is so common, there exists a prebuilt state called MessagesState which makes it easy to use messages. MessagesState is defined with a single messages key which is a list of AnyMessage objects and uses the add_messages reducer. Typically, there is more state to track than just messages, so we see people subclass this state and add more fields, like:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\n\nclass State(MessagesState):\n    documents: list[str]\n\n�\nNodes\nIn LangGraph, nodes are Python functions (either synchronous or asynchronous) that accept the following arguments:\nstate – The state of the graph\nconfig – A RunnableConfig object that contains configuration information like thread_id and tracing information like tags\nruntime – A Runtime object that contains runtime context and other information like store and stream_writer\nSimilar to NetworkX, you add these nodes to a graph using the add_node method:\nCopy\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    results: str\n\n@dataclass\nclass Context:\n    user_id: str\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\n\ndef plain_node(state: State):\n    return state\n\ndef node_with_runtime(state: State, runtime: Runtime[Context]):\n    print(\"In node: \", runtime.context.user_id)\n    return {\"results\": f\"Hello, {state['input']}!\"}\n\ndef node_with_config(state: State, config: RunnableConfig):\n    print(\"In node with thread_id: \", config[\"configurable\"][\"thread_id\"])\n    return {\"results\": f\"Hello, {state['input']}!\"}\n\n\nbuilder.add_node(\"plain_node\", plain_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_with_runtime\", node_with_runtime)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_with_config\", node_with_config)\n...\n\nBehind the scenes, functions are converted to RunnableLambda, which add batch and async support to your function, along with native tracing and debugging.\nIf you add a node to a graph without specifying a name, it will be given a default name equivalent to the function name.\nCopy\nbuilder.add_node(my_node)\n# You can then create edges to/from this node by referencing it as `\"my_node\"`\n\n�\nSTART node\nThe START Node is a special node that represents the node that sends user input to the graph. The main purpose for referencing this node is to determine which nodes should be called first.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import START\n\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\n\n�\nEND node\nThe END Node is a special node that represents a terminal node. This node is referenced when you want to denote which edges have no actions after they are done.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import END\n\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", END)\n\n�\nNode caching\nLangGraph supports caching of tasks/nodes based on the input to the node. To use caching:\nSpecify a cache when compiling a graph (or specifying an entrypoint)\nSpecify a cache policy for nodes. Each cache policy supports:\nkey_func used to generate a cache key based on the input to a node, which defaults to a hash of the input with pickle.\nttl, the time to live for the cache in seconds. If not specified, the cache will never expire.\nFor example:\nCopy\nimport time\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\nfrom langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache\nfrom langgraph.types import CachePolicy\n\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    x: int\n    result: int\n\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\n\n\ndef expensive_node(state: State) -> dict[str, int]:\n    # expensive computation\n    time.sleep(2)\n    return {\"result\": state[\"x\"] * 2}\n\n\nbuilder.add_node(\"expensive_node\", expensive_node, cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=3))\nbuilder.set_entry_point(\"expensive_node\")\nbuilder.set_finish_point(\"expensive_node\")\n\ngraph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())\n\nprint(graph.invoke({\"x\": 5}, stream_mode='updates'))    \n# [{'expensive_node': {'result': 10}}]\nprint(graph.invoke({\"x\": 5}, stream_mode='updates'))    \n# [{'expensive_node': {'result': 10}, '__metadata__': {'cached': True}}]\n\nFirst run takes two seconds to run (due to mocked expensive computation).\nSecond run utilizes cache and returns quickly.\n�\nEdges\nEdges define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges:\nNormal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next.\nConditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next.\nEntry Point: Which node to call first when user input arrives.\nConditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s) to call first when user input arrives.\nA node can have multiple outgoing edges. If a node has multiple outgoing edges, all of those destination nodes will be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\n�\nNormal edges\nIf you always want to go from node A to node B, you can use the add_edge method directly.\nCopy\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\")\n\n�\nConditional edges\nIf you want to optionally route to one or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the add_conditional_edges method. This method accepts the name of a node and a “routing function” to call after that node is executed:\nCopy\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function)\n\nSimilar to nodes, the routing_function accepts the current state of the graph and returns a value.\nBy default, the return value routing_function is used as the name of the node (or list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\nYou can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function’s output to the name of the next node.\nCopy\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"})\n\nUse Command instead of conditional edges if you want to combine state updates and routing in a single function.\n�\nEntry point\nThe entry point is the first node(s) that are run when the graph starts. You can use the add_edge method from the virtual START node to the first node to execute to specify where to enter the graph.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import START\n\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\n\n�\nConditional entry point\nA conditional entry point lets you start at different nodes depending on custom logic. You can use add_conditional_edges from the virtual START node to accomplish this.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import START\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(START, routing_function)\n\nYou can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function’s output to the name of the next node.\nCopy\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(START, routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"})\n\n�\nSend\nBy default, Nodes and Edges are defined ahead of time and operate on the same shared state. However, there can be cases where the exact edges are not known ahead of time and/or you may want different versions of State to exist at the same time. A common example of this is with map-reduce design patterns. In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects, and you may want to apply some other node to all those objects. The number of objects may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) and the input State to the downstream Node should be different (one for each generated object).\nTo support this design pattern, LangGraph supports returning Send objects from conditional edges. Send takes two arguments: first is the name of the node, and second is the state to pass to that node.\nCopy\ndef continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):\n    return [Send(\"generate_joke\", {\"subject\": s}) for s in state['subjects']]\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", continue_to_jokes)\n\n�\nCommand\nIt can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:\nCopy\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        # state update\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\n        # control flow\n        goto=\"my_other_node\"\n    )\n\nWith Command you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical to conditional edges):\nCopy\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    if state[\"foo\"] == \"bar\":\n        return Command(update={\"foo\": \"baz\"}, goto=\"my_other_node\")\n\nNote that Command only adds dynamic edges, while static edges will still execute. In other words, Command doesn’t override static edges.\nCopy\ndef node_a(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n   if state[\"foo\"] == \"bar\":\n       return Command(update={\"foo\": \"baz\"}, goto=\"my_other_node\")\n\n# Add a static edge from \"node_a\" to \"node_b\"\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\")\n\n# Command will NOT prevent \"node_a\" from going to \"node_b\"\n\nIn the example above, “node_a” will go to both “node_b” and “my_other_node”.\nWhen returning Command in your node functions, you must add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to, e.g. Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that my_node can navigate to my_other_node.\nCheck out this how-to guide for an end-to-end example of how to use Command.\n�\nWhen should I use command instead of conditional edges?\nUse Command when you need to both update the graph state and route to a different node. For example, when implementing multi-agent handoffs where it’s important to route to a different agent and pass some information to that agent.\nUse conditional edges to route between nodes conditionally without updating the state.\n�\nNavigating to a node in a parent graph\nIf you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:\nCopy\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"other_subgraph\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\n        goto=\"other_subgraph\",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph\n        graph=Command.PARENT\n    )\n\nSetting graph to Command.PARENT will navigate to the closest parent graph.\nWhen you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that’s shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you’re updating in the parent graph state. See this example.\nThis is particularly useful when implementing multi-agent handoffs.\nCheck out this guide for detail.\n�\nUsing inside tools\nA common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation.\nRefer to this guide for detail.\n�\nHuman-in-the-loop\nCommand is an important part of human-in-the-loop workflows: when using interrupt() to collect user input, Command is then used to supply the input and resume execution via Command(resume=\"User input\"). Check out this conceptual guide for more information.\n�\nGraph migrations\nLangGraph can easily handle migrations of graph definitions (nodes, edges, and state) even when using a checkpointer to track state.\nFor threads at the end of the graph (i.e. not interrupted) you can change the entire topology of the graph (i.e. all nodes and edges, remove, add, rename, etc)\nFor threads currently interrupted, we support all topology changes other than renaming / removing nodes (as that thread could now be about to enter a node that no longer exists) — if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.\nFor modifying state, we have full backwards and forwards compatibility for adding and removing keys\nState keys that are renamed lose their saved state in existing threads\nState keys whose types change in incompatible ways could currently cause issues in threads with state from before the change — if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.\n�\nRuntime context\nWhen creating a graph, you can specify a context_schema for runtime context passed to nodes. This is useful for passing information to nodes that is not part of the graph state. For example, you might want to pass dependencies such as model name or a database connection.\nCopy\n@dataclass\nclass ContextSchema:\n    llm_provider: str = \"openai\"\n\ngraph = StateGraph(State, context_schema=ContextSchema)\n\nYou can then pass this context into the graph using the context parameter of the invoke method.\nCopy\ngraph.invoke(inputs, context={\"llm_provider\": \"anthropic\"})\n\nYou can then access and use this context inside a node or conditional edge:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\n\ndef node_a(state: State, runtime: Runtime[ContextSchema]):\n    llm = get_llm(runtime.context.llm_provider)\n    # ...\n\nSee this guide for a full breakdown on configuration.\n�\nRecursion limit\nThe recursion limit sets the maximum number of super-steps the graph can execute during a single execution. Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise GraphRecursionError. Starting in version 1.0.6, the deafult recursion limit is set to 1000 steps. The recursion limit can be set on any graph at runtime, and is passed to invoke/stream via the config dictionary. Importantly, recursion_limit is a standalone config key and should not be passed inside the configurable key as all other user-defined configuration. See the example below:\nCopy\ngraph.invoke(inputs, config={\"recursion_limit\": 5}, context={\"llm\": \"anthropic\"})\n\nRead this how-to to learn more about how the recursion limit works.\n�\nAccessing and handling the recursion counter\nThe current step counter is accessible in config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"] within any node, allowing for proactive recursion handling before hitting the recursion limit. This enables you to implement graceful degradation strategies within your graph logic.\n�\nHow it works\nThe step counter is stored in config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]. The recursion limit check follows the logic: step > stop where stop = step + recursion_limit + 1. When the limit is exceeded, LangGraph raises a GraphRecursionError.\n�\nAccessing the current step counter\nYou can access the current step counter within any node to monitor execution progress.\nCopy\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\ndef my_node(state: dict, config: RunnableConfig) -> dict:\n    current_step = config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]\n    print(f\"Currently on step: {current_step}\")\n    return state\n\n�\nProactive recursion handling\nLangGraph provides a RemainingSteps managed value that tracks how many steps remain before hitting the recursion limit. This allows for graceful degradation within your graph.\nCopy\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.managed import RemainingSteps\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list, lambda x, y: x + y]\n    remaining_steps: RemainingSteps  # Managed value - tracks steps until limit\n\ndef reasoning_node(state: State) -> dict:\n    # RemainingSteps is automatically populated by LangGraph\n    remaining = state[\"remaining_steps\"]\n\n    # Check if we're running low on steps\n    if remaining <= 2:\n        return {\"messages\": [\"Approaching limit, wrapping up...\"]}\n\n    # Normal processing\n    return {\"messages\": [\"thinking...\"]}\n\ndef route_decision(state: State) -> Literal[\"reasoning_node\", \"fallback_node\"]:\n    \"\"\"Route based on remaining steps\"\"\"\n    if state[\"remaining_steps\"] <= 2:\n        return \"fallback_node\"\n    return \"reasoning_node\"\n\ndef fallback_node(state: State) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Handle cases where recursion limit is approaching\"\"\"\n    return {\"messages\": [\"Reached complexity limit, providing best effort answer\"]}\n\n# Build graph\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"reasoning_node\", reasoning_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"fallback_node\", fallback_node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"reasoning_node\")\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"reasoning_node\", route_decision)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"fallback_node\", END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\n# RemainingSteps works with any recursion_limit\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": []}, {\"recursion_limit\": 10})\n\n�\nProactive vs reactive approaches\nThere are two main approaches to handling recursion limits: proactive (monitoring within the graph) and reactive (catching errors externally).\nCopy\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal, TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.managed import RemainingSteps\nfrom langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list, lambda x, y: x + y]\n    remaining_steps: RemainingSteps\n\n# Proactive Approach (recommended) - using RemainingSteps\ndef agent_with_monitoring(state: State) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Proactively monitor and handle recursion within the graph\"\"\"\n    remaining = state[\"remaining_steps\"]\n\n    # Early detection - route to internal handling\n    if remaining <= 2:\n        return {\n            \"messages\": [\"Approaching limit, returning partial result\"]\n        }\n\n    # Normal processing\n    return {\"messages\": [f\"Processing...

Actors read data from channels and write data to channels. Pregel organizes the execution of the application into multiple steps, following the Pregel Algorithm/Bulk Synchronous Parallel model.\nEach step consists of three phases:\nPlan: Determine which actors to execute in this step. For example, in the first step, select the actors that subscribe to the special input channels; in subsequent steps, select the actors that subscribe to channels updated in the previous step.\nExecution: Execute all selected actors in parallel, until all complete, or one fails, or a timeout is reached. During this phase, channel updates are invisible to actors until the next step.\nUpdate: Update the channels with the values written by the actors in this step.\nRepeat until no actors are selected for execution, or a maximum number of steps is reached.\n�\nActors\nAn actor is a PregelNode. It subscribes to channels, reads data from them, and writes data to them. It can be thought of as an actor in the Pregel algorithm. PregelNodes implement LangChain’s Runnable interface.\n�\nChannels\nChannels are used to communicate between actors (PregelNodes). Each channel has a value type, an update type, and an update function – which takes a sequence of updates and modifies the stored value. Channels can be used to send data from one chain to another, or to send data from a chain to itself in a future step. LangGraph provides a number of built-in channels:\nLastValue: The default channel, stores the last value sent to the channel, useful for input and output values, or for sending data from one step to the next.\nTopic: A configurable PubSub Topic, useful for sending multiple values between actors, or for accumulating output. Can be configured to deduplicate values or to accumulate values over the course of multiple steps.\nBinaryOperatorAggregate: stores a persistent value, updated by applying a binary operator to the current value and each update sent to the channel, useful for computing aggregates over multiple steps; e.g.,total = BinaryOperatorAggregate(int, operator.add)\n�\nExamples\nWhile most users will interact with Pregel through the StateGraph API or the @entrypoint decorator, it is possible to interact with Pregel directly.\nBelow are a few different examples to give you a sense of the Pregel API.\nSingle node\nMultiple nodes\nTopic\nBinaryOperatorAggregate\nCycle\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.channels import EphemeralValue\nfrom langgraph.pregel import Pregel, NodeBuilder\n\nnode1 = (\n    NodeBuilder().subscribe_only(\"a\")\n    .do(lambda x: x + x)\n    .write_to(\"b\")\n)\n\napp = Pregel(\n    nodes={\"node1\": node1},\n    channels={\n        \"a\": EphemeralValue(str),\n        \"b\": EphemeralValue(str),\n    },\n    input_channels=[\"a\"],\n    output_channels=[\"b\"],\n)\n\napp.invoke({\"a\": \"foo\"})\n\nCopy\n{'b': 'foofoo'}\n\n�\nHigh-level API\nLangGraph provides two high-level APIs for creating a Pregel application: the StateGraph (Graph API) and the Functional API.\nStateGraph (Graph API)\nFunctional API\nThe StateGraph (Graph API) is a higher-level abstraction that simplifies the creation of Pregel applications. It allows you to define a graph of nodes and edges. When you compile the graph, the StateGraph API automatically creates the Pregel application for you.\nCopy\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nfrom langgraph.constants import START\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\nclass Essay(TypedDict):\n    topic: str\n    content: str | None\n    score: float | None\n\ndef write_essay(essay: Essay):\n    return {\n        \"content\": f\"Essay about {essay['topic']}\",\n    }\n\ndef score_essay(essay: Essay):\n    return {\n        \"score\": 10\n    }\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(Essay)\nbuilder.add_node(write_essay)\nbuilder.add_node(score_essay)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"write_essay\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"write_essay\", \"score_essay\")\n\n# Compile the graph.\n# This will return a Pregel instance.\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nThe compiled Pregel instance will be associated with a list of nodes and channels. You can inspect the nodes and channels by printing them.\nCopy\nprint(graph.nodes)\n\nYou will see something like this:\nCopy\n{'__start__': <langgraph.pregel.read.PregelNode at 0x7d05e3ba1810>,\n 'write_essay': <langgraph.pregel.read.PregelNode at 0x7d05e3ba14d0>,\n 'score_essay': <langgraph.pregel.read.PregelNode at 0x7d05e3ba1710>}\n\nCopy\nprint(graph.channels)\n\nYou should see something like this\nCopy\n{'topic': <langgraph.channels.last_value.LastValue at 0x7d05e3294d80>,\n 'content': <langgraph.channels.last_value.LastValue at 0x7d05e3295040>,\n 'score': <langgraph.channels.last_value.LastValue at 0x7d05e3295980>,\n '__start__': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e3297e00>,\n 'write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e32960c0>,\n 'score_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d8ab80>,\n 'branch:__start__:__self__:write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e32941c0>,\n 'branch:__start__:__self__:score_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d88800>,\n 'branch:write_essay:__self__:write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e3295ec0>,\n 'branch:write_essay:__self__:score_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d8ac00>,\n 'branch:score_essay:__self__:write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d89700>,\n 'branch:score_essay:__self__:score_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d8b400>,\n 'start:write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d8b280>}\n\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

Run the agentic RAG\nTutorials\nLangGraph\nBuild a custom RAG agent with LangGraph\nCopy page\n�\nOverview\nIn this tutorial we will build a retrieval agent using LangGraph.\nLangChain offers built-in agent implementations, implemented using LangGraph primitives. If deeper customization is required, agents can be implemented directly in LangGraph. This guide demonstrates an example implementation of a retrieval agent. Retrieval agents are useful when you want an LLM to make a decision about whether to retrieve context from a vectorstore or respond to the user directly.\nBy the end of the tutorial we will have done the following:\nFetch and preprocess documents that will be used for retrieval.\nIndex those documents for semantic search and create a retriever tool for the agent.\nBuild an agentic RAG system that can decide when to use the retriever tool.\n�\nConcepts\nWe will cover the following concepts:\nRetrieval using document loaders, text splitters, embeddings, and vector stores\nThe LangGraph Graph API, including state, nodes, edges, and conditional edges.\n�\nSetup\nLet’s download the required packages and set our API keys:\nCopy\npip install -U langgraph \"langchain[openai]\" langchain-community langchain-text-splitters bs4\n\nCopy\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\n\ndef _set_env(key: str):\n    if key not in os.environ:\n        os.environ[key] = getpass.getpass(f\"{key}:\")\n\n\n_set_env(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n\nSign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph.\n�\n1. Preprocess documents\nFetch documents to use in our RAG system. We will use three of the most recent pages from Lilian Weng’s excellent blog. We’ll start by fetching the content of the pages using WebBaseLoader utility:\nCopy\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n\nurls = [\n    \"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-11-28-reward-hacking/\",\n    \"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/\",\n    \"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-04-12-diffusion-video/\",\n]\n\ndocs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls]\n\nCopy\ndocs[0][0].page_content.strip()[:1000]\n\nSplit the fetched documents into smaller chunks for indexing into our vectorstore:\nCopy\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n\ndocs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist]\n\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(\n    chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=50\n)\ndoc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list)\n\nCopy\ndoc_splits[0].page_content.strip()\n\n�\n2. Create a retriever tool\nNow that we have our split documents, we can index them into a vector store that we’ll use for semantic search.\nUse an in-memory vector store and OpenAI embeddings:\nCopy\nfrom langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\nvectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore.from_documents(\n    documents=doc_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()\n)\nretriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()\n\nCreate a retriever tool using the @tool decorator:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\n\n@tool\ndef retrieve_blog_posts(query: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Search and return information about Lilian Weng blog posts.\"\"\"\n    docs = retriever.invoke(query)\n    return \"\\n\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])\n\nretriever_tool = retrieve_blog_posts\n\nTest the tool:\nCopy\nretriever_tool.invoke({\"query\": \"types of reward hacking\"})\n\n�\n3. Generate query\nNow we will start building components (nodes and edges) for our agentic RAG graph.\nNote that the components will operate on the MessagesState — graph state that contains a messages key with a list of chat messages.\nBuild a generate_query_or_respond node. It will call an LLM to generate a response based on the current graph state (list of messages). Given the input messages, it will decide to retrieve using the retriever tool, or respond directly to the user. Note that we’re giving the chat model access to the retriever_tool we created earlier via .bind_tools:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\n\nresponse_model = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4.1\", temperature=0)\n\n\ndef generate_query_or_respond(state: MessagesState):\n    \"\"\"Call the model to generate a response based on the current state.

Grade documents\nAdd a conditional edge — grade_documents — to determine whether the retrieved documents are relevant to the question. We will use a model with a structured output schema GradeDocuments for document grading. The grade_documents function will return the name of the node to go to based on the grading decision (generate_answer or rewrite_question):\nCopy\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nGRADE_PROMPT = (\n    \"You are a grader assessing relevance of a retrieved document to a user question. \\n \"\n    \"Here is the retrieved document: \\n\\n {context} \\n\\n\"\n    \"Here is the user question: {question} \\n\"\n    \"If the document contains keyword(s) or semantic meaning related to the user question, grade it as relevant. \\n\"\n    \"Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no' score to indicate whether the document is relevant to the question.\"\n)\n\n\nclass GradeDocuments(BaseModel):  \n    \"\"\"Grade documents using a binary score for relevance check.\"\"\"\n\n    binary_score: str = Field(\n        description=\"Relevance score: 'yes' if relevant, or 'no' if not relevant\"\n    )\n\n\ngrader_model = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4.1\", temperature=0)\n\n\ndef grade_documents(\n    state: MessagesState,\n) -> Literal[\"generate_answer\", \"rewrite_question\"]:\n    \"\"\"Determine whether the retrieved documents are relevant to the question.\"\"\"\n    question = state[\"messages\"][0].content\n    context = state[\"messages\"][-1].content\n\n    prompt = GRADE_PROMPT.format(question=question, context=context)\n    response = (\n        grader_model\n        .with_structured_output(GradeDocuments).invoke(  \n            [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n        )\n    )\n    score = response.binary_score\n\n    if score == \"yes\":\n        return \"generate_answer\"\n    else:\n        return \"rewrite_question\"\n\nRun this with irrelevant documents in the tool response:\nCopy\nfrom langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages\n\ninput = {\n    \"messages\": convert_to_messages(\n        [\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": \"What does Lilian Weng say about types of reward hacking?\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"content\": \"\",\n                \"tool_calls\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"1\",\n                        \"name\": \"retrieve_blog_posts\",\n                        \"args\": {\"query\": \"types of reward hacking\"},\n                    }\n                ],\n            },\n            {\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": \"meow\", \"tool_call_id\": \"1\"},\n        ]\n    )\n}\ngrade_documents(input)\n\nConfirm that the relevant documents are classified as such:\nCopy\ninput = {\n    \"messages\": convert_to_messages(\n        [\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": \"What does Lilian Weng say about types of reward hacking?\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"content\": \"\",\n                \"tool_calls\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"1\",\n                        \"name\": \"retrieve_blog_posts\",\n                        \"args\": {\"query\": \"types of reward hacking\"},\n                    }\n                ],\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"tool\",\n                \"content\": \"reward hacking can be categorized into two types: environment or goal misspecification, and reward tampering\",\n                \"tool_call_id\": \"1\",\n            },\n        ]\n    )\n}\ngrade_documents(input)\n\n�\n5. Rewrite question\nBuild the rewrite_question node. The retriever tool can return potentially irrelevant documents, which indicates a need to improve the original user question. To do so, we will call the rewrite_question node:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import HumanMessage\n\nREWRITE_PROMPT = (\n    \"Look at the input and try to reason about the underlying semantic intent / meaning.\\n\"\n    \"Here is the initial question:\"\n    \"\\n ------- \\n\"\n    \"{question}\"\n    \"\\n ------- \\n\"\n    \"Formulate an improved question:\"\n)\n\n\ndef rewrite_question(state: MessagesState):\n    \"\"\"Rewrite the original user question.\"\"\"\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    question = messages[0].content\n    prompt = REWRITE_PROMPT.format(question=question)\n    response = response_model.invoke([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}])\n    return {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=response.content)]}\n\nTry it out:\nCopy\ninput = {\n    \"messages\": convert_to_messages(\n        [\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": \"What does Lilian Weng say about types of reward hacking?\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"content\": \"\",\n                \"tool_calls\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"1\",\n                        \"name\": \"retrieve_blog_posts\",\n                        \"args\": {\"query\": \"types of reward hacking\"},\n                    }\n                ],\n            },\n            {\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": \"meow\", \"tool_call_id\": \"1\"},\n        ]\n    )\n}\n\nresponse = rewrite_question(input)\nprint(response[\"messages\"][-1].content)\n\nOutput:\nCopy\nWhat are the different types of reward hacking described by Lilian Weng, and how does she explain them?\n\n�\n6. Generate an answer\nBuild generate_answer node: if we pass the grader checks, we can generate the final answer based on the original question and the retrieved context:\nCopy\nGENERATE_PROMPT = (\n    \"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \"\n    \"Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \"\n    \"If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. \"\n    \"Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\n\"\n    \"Question: {question} \\n\"\n    \"Context: {context}\"\n)\n\n\ndef generate_answer(state: MessagesState):\n    \"\"\"Generate an answer.\"\"\"\n    question = state[\"messages\"][0].content\n    context = state[\"messages\"][-1].content\n    prompt = GENERATE_PROMPT.format(question=question, context=context)\n    response = response_model.invoke([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}])\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\nTry it:\nCopy\ninput = {\n    \"messages\": convert_to_messages(\n        [\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": \"What does Lilian Weng say about types of reward hacking?\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"content\": \"\",\n                \"tool_calls\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"1\",\n                        \"name\": \"retrieve_blog_posts\",\n                        \"args\": {\"query\": \"types of reward hacking\"},\n                    }\n                ],\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"tool\",\n                \"content\": \"reward hacking can be categorized into two types: environment or goal misspecification, and reward tampering\",\n                \"tool_call_id\": \"1\",\n            },\n        ]\n    )\n}\n\nresponse = generate_answer(input)\nresponse[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\n\nOutput:\nCopy\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nLilian Weng categorizes reward hacking into two types: environment or goal misspecification, and reward tampering.

But I consider reward hacking as a broader concept here.)\nAt a high level, reward hacking can be categorized into two types: environment or goal misspecification, and reward tampering.\n\nWhy does Reward Hacking Exist?#\n\nPan et al. (2022) investigated reward hacking as a function of agent capabilities, including (1) model size, (2) action space resolution, (3) observation space noise, and (4) training time. They also proposed a taxonomy of three types of misspecified proxy rewards:\n\nLet's Define Reward Hacking#\nReward shaping in RL is challenging. Reward hacking occurs when an RL agent exploits flaws or ambiguities in the reward function to obtain high rewards without genuinely learning the intended behaviors or completing the task as designed. In recent years, several related concepts have been proposed, all referring to some form of reward hacking:\n\n\n\nUpdate from node generate_answer\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nLilian Weng categorizes reward hacking into two types: environment or goal misspecification, and reward tampering.

LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs.\n�\nDefine and update state\nHere we show how to define and update state in LangGraph. We will demonstrate:\nHow to use state to define a graph’s schema\nHow to use reducers to control how state updates are processed.\n�\nDefine state\nState in LangGraph can be a TypedDict, Pydantic model, or dataclass. Below we will use TypedDict. See this section for detail on using Pydantic.\nBy default, graphs will have the same input and output schema, and the state determines that schema. See this section for how to define distinct input and output schemas.\nLet’s consider a simple example using messages. This represents a versatile formulation of state for many LLM applications. See our concepts page for more detail.\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import AnyMessage\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: list[AnyMessage]\n    extra_field: int\n\nThis state tracks a list of message objects, as well as an extra integer field.\n�\nUpdate state\nLet’s build an example graph with a single node. Our node is just a Python function that reads our graph’s state and makes updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import AIMessage\n\ndef node(state: State):\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    new_message = AIMessage(\"Hello!\")\n    return {\"messages\": messages + [new_message], \"extra_field\": 10}\n\nThis node simply appends a message to our message list, and populates an extra field.\nNodes should return updates to the state directly, instead of mutating the state.\nLet’s next define a simple graph containing this node. We use StateGraph to define a graph that operates on this state. We then use add_node populate our graph.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(node)\nbuilder.set_entry_point(\"node\")\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nLangGraph provides built-in utilities for visualizing your graph. Let’s inspect our graph. See this section for detail on visualization.\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nIn this case, our graph just executes a single node. Let’s proceed with a simple invocation:\nCopy\nfrom langchain.messages import HumanMessage\n\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(\"Hi\")]})\nresult\n\nCopy\n{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='Hi'), AIMessage(content='Hello!')], 'extra_field': 10}\n\nNote that:\nWe kicked off invocation by updating a single key of the state.\nWe receive the entire state in the invocation result.\nFor convenience, we frequently inspect the content of message objects via pretty-print:\nCopy\nfor message in result[\"messages\"]:\n    message.pretty_print()\n\nCopy\n================================ Human Message ================================\n\nHi\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nHello!\n\n�\nProcess state updates with reducers\nEach key in the state can have its own independent reducer function, which controls how updates from nodes are applied. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to the key should override it.\nFor TypedDict state schemas, we can define reducers by annotating the corresponding field of the state with a reducer function.\nIn the earlier example, our node updated the \"messages\" key in the state by appending a message to it. Below, we add a reducer to this key, such that updates are automatically appended:\nCopy\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\n\ndef add(left, right):\n    \"\"\"Can also import `add` from the `operator` built-in.\"\"\"\n    return left + right\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add]  \n    extra_field: int\n\nNow our node can be simplified:\nCopy\ndef node(state: State):\n    new_message = AIMessage(\"Hello!\")\n    return {\"messages\": [new_message], \"extra_field\": 10}  \n\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import START\n\ngraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).add_edge(START, \"node\").compile()\n\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(\"Hi\")]})\n\nfor message in result[\"messages\"]:\n    message.pretty_print()\n\nCopy\n================================ Human Message ================================\n\nHi\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nHello!\n\n�\nMessagesState\nIn practice, there are additional considerations for updating lists of messages:\nWe may wish to update an existing message in the state.\nWe may want to accept short-hands for message formats, such as OpenAI format.\nLangGraph includes a built-in reducer add_messages that handles these considerations:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]  \n    extra_field: int\n\ndef node(state: State):\n    new_message = AIMessage(\"Hello!\")\n    return {\"messages\": [new_message], \"extra_field\": 10}\n\ngraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).set_entry_point(\"node\").compile()\n\nCopy\ninput_message = {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hi\"}  \n\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [input_message]})\n\nfor message in result[\"messages\"]:\n    message.pretty_print()\n\nCopy\n================================ Human Message ================================\n\nHi\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nHello!\n\nThis is a versatile representation of state for applications involving chat models. LangGraph includes a pre-built MessagesState for convenience, so that we can have:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\n\nclass State(MessagesState):\n    extra_field: int\n\n�\nBypass reducers with Overwrite\nIn some cases, you may want to bypass a reducer and directly overwrite a state value. LangGraph provides the Overwrite type for this purpose. When a node returns a value wrapped with Overwrite, the reducer is bypassed and the channel is set directly to that value.\nThis is useful when you want to reset or replace accumulated state rather than merge it with existing values.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.types import Overwrite\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict\nimport operator\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]\n\ndef add_message(state: State):\n    return {\"messages\": [\"first message\"]}\n\ndef replace_messages(state: State):\n    # Bypass the reducer and replace the entire messages list\n    return {\"messages\": Overwrite([\"replacement message\"])}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"add_message\", add_message)\nbuilder.add_node(\"replace_messages\", replace_messages)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"add_message\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"add_message\", \"replace_messages\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"replace_messages\", END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [\"initial\"]})\nprint(result[\"messages\"])\n\nCopy\n['replacement message']\n\nYou can also use JSON format with the special key \"__overwrite__\":\nCopy\ndef replace_messages(state: State):\n    return {\"messages\": {\"__overwrite__\": [\"replacement message\"]}}\n\nWhen nodes execute in parallel, only one node can use Overwrite on the same state key in a given super-step. If multiple nodes attempt to overwrite the same key in the same super-step, an InvalidUpdateError will be raised.\n�\nDefine input and output schemas\nBy default, StateGraph operates with a single schema, and all nodes are expected to communicate using that schema. However, it’s also possible to define distinct input and output schemas for a graph.\nWhen distinct schemas are specified, an internal schema will still be used for communication between nodes. The input schema ensures that the provided input matches the expected structure, while the output schema filters the internal data to return only the relevant information according to the defined output schema.\nBelow, we’ll see how to define distinct input and output schema.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\n# Define the schema for the input\nclass InputState(TypedDict):\n    question: str\n\n# Define the schema for the output\nclass OutputState(TypedDict):\n    answer: str\n\n# Define the overall schema, combining both input and output\nclass OverallState(InputState, OutputState):\n    pass\n\n# Define the node that processes the input and generates an answer\ndef answer_node(state: InputState):\n    # Example answer and an extra key\n    return {\"answer\": \"bye\", \"question\": state[\"question\"]}\n\n# Build the graph with input and output schemas specified\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState, input_schema=InputState, output_schema=OutputState)\nbuilder.add_node(answer_node)  # Add the answer node\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"answer_node\")  # Define the starting edge\nbuilder.add_edge(\"answer_node\", END)  # Define the ending edge\ngraph = builder.compile()  # Compile the graph\n\n# Invoke the graph with an input and print the result\nprint(graph.invoke({\"question\": \"hi\"}))\n\nCopy\n{'answer': 'bye'}\n\nNotice that the output of invoke only includes the output schema.\n�\nPass private state between nodes\nIn some cases, you may want nodes to exchange information that is crucial for intermediate logic but doesn’t need to be part of the main schema of the graph. This private data is not relevant to the overall input/output of the graph and should only be shared between certain nodes.\nBelow, we’ll create an example sequential graph consisting of three nodes (node_1, node_2 and node_3), where private data is passed between the first two steps (node_1 and node_2), while the third step (node_3) only has access to the public overall state.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\n# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)\nclass OverallState(TypedDict):\n    a: str\n\n# Output from node_1 contains private data that is not part of the overall state\nclass Node1Output(TypedDict):\n    private_data: str\n\n# The private data is only shared between node_1 and node_2\ndef node_1(state: OverallState) -> Node1Output:\n    output = {\"private_data\": \"set by node_1\"}\n    print(f\"Entered node `node_1`:\\n\\tInput: {state}.\\n\\tReturned: {output}\")\n    return output\n\n# Node 2 input only requests the private data available after node_1\nclass Node2Input(TypedDict):\n    private_data: str\n\ndef node_2(state: Node2Input) -> OverallState:\n    output = {\"a\": \"set by node_2\"}\n    print(f\"Entered node `node_2`:\\n\\tInput: {state}.\\n\\tReturned: {output}\")\n    return output\n\n# Node 3 only has access to the overall state (no access to private data from node_1)\ndef node_3(state: OverallState) -> OverallState:\n    output = {\"a\": \"set by node_3\"}\n    print(f\"Entered node `node_3`:\\n\\tInput: {state}.\\n\\tReturned: {output}\")\n    return output\n\n# Connect nodes in a sequence\n# node_2 accepts private data from node_1, whereas\n# node_3 does not see the private data.\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState).add_sequence([node_1, node_2, node_3])\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\n# Invoke the graph with the initial state\nresponse = graph.invoke(\n    {\n        \"a\": \"set at start\",\n    }\n)\n\nprint()\nprint(f\"Output of graph invocation: {response}\")\n\nCopy\nEntered node `node_1`:\n    Input: {'a': 'set at start'}.\n    Returned: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}\nEntered node `node_2`:\n    Input: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}.\n    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_2'}\nEntered node `node_3`:\n    Input: {'a': 'set by node_2'}.\n    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_3'}\n\nOutput of graph invocation: {'a': 'set by node_3'}\n\n�\nUse pydantic models for graph state\nA StateGraph accepts a state_schema argument on initialization that specifies the “shape” of the state that the nodes in the graph can access and update.\nIn our examples, we typically use a python-native TypedDict or dataclass for state_schema, but state_schema can be any type.\nHere, we’ll see how a Pydantic BaseModel can be used for state_schema to add run-time validation on inputs.\nKnown Limitations\nCurrently, the output of the graph will NOT be an instance of a pydantic model.\nRun-time validation only occurs on inputs to the first node in the graph, not on subsequent nodes or outputs.\nThe validation error trace from pydantic does not show which node the error arises in.\nPydantic’s recursive validation can be slow. For performance-sensitive applications, you may want to consider using a dataclass instead.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)\nclass OverallState(BaseModel):\n    a: str\n\ndef node(state: OverallState):\n    return {\"a\": \"goodbye\"}\n\n# Build the state graph\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState)\nbuilder.add_node(node)  # node_1 is the first node\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node\")  # Start the graph with node_1\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node\", END)  # End the graph after node_1\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\n# Test the graph with a valid input\ngraph.invoke({\"a\": \"hello\"})\n\nInvoke the graph with an invalid input\nCopy\ntry:\n    graph.invoke({\"a\": 123})  # Should be a string\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.\")\n    print(e)\n\nCopy\nAn exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.\n1 validation error for OverallState\na\n  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.9/v/string_type\n\nSee below for additional features of Pydantic model state:\n\nSerialization Behavior\n\nRuntime Type Coercion\n\nWorking with Message Models\n\n�\nAdd runtime configuration\nSometimes you want to be able to configure your graph when calling it. For example, you might want to be able to specify what LLM or system prompt to use at runtime, without polluting the graph state with these parameters.\nTo add runtime configuration:\nSpecify a schema for your configuration\nAdd the configuration to the function signature for nodes or conditional edges\nPass the configuration into the graph.\nSee below for a simple example:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\n# 1. Specify config schema\nclass ContextSchema(TypedDict):\n    my_runtime_value: str\n\n# 2. Define a graph that accesses the config in a node\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    my_state_value: str\n\ndef node(state: State, runtime: Runtime[ContextSchema]):  \n    if runtime.context[\"my_runtime_value\"] == \"a\":  \n        return {\"my_state_value\": 1}\n    elif runtime.context[\"my_runtime_value\"] == \"b\":  \n        return {\"my_state_value\": 2}\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unknown values.\")\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State, context_schema=ContextSchema)  \nbuilder.add_node(node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node\", END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\n# 3. Pass in configuration at runtime:\nprint(graph.invoke({}, context={\"my_runtime_value\": \"a\"}))  \nprint(graph.invoke({}, context={\"my_runtime_value\": \"b\"}))  \n\nCopy\n{'my_state_value': 1}\n{'my_state_value': 2}\n\n\nExtended example: specifying LLM at runtime\n\nExtended example: specifying model and system message at runtime\n\n�\nAdd retry policies\nThere are many use cases where you may wish for your node to have a custom retry policy, for example if you are calling an API, querying a database, or calling an LLM, etc. LangGraph lets you add retry policies to nodes.\nTo configure a retry policy, pass the retry_policy parameter to the add_node. The retry_policy parameter takes in a RetryPolicy named tuple object. Below we instantiate a RetryPolicy object with the default parameters and associate it with a node:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.types import RetryPolicy\n\nbuilder.add_node(\n    \"node_name\",\n    node_function,\n    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(),\n)\n\nBy default, the retry_on parameter uses the default_retry_on function, which retries on any exception except for the following:\nValueError\nTypeError\nArithmeticError\nImportError\nLookupError\nNameError\nSyntaxError\nRuntimeError\nReferenceError\nStopIteration\nStopAsyncIteration\nOSError\nIn addition, for exceptions from popular http request libraries such as requests and httpx it only retries on 5xx status codes.\n\nExtended example: customizing retry policies\n\n�\nAdd node caching\nNode caching is useful in cases where you want to avoid repeating operations, like when doing something expensive (either in terms of time or cost). LangGraph lets you add individualized caching policies to nodes in a graph.\nTo configure a cache policy, pass the cache_policy parameter to the add_node function. In the following example, a CachePolicy object is instantiated with a time to live of 120 seconds and the default key_func generator. Then it is associated with a node:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.types import CachePolicy\n\nbuilder.add_node(\n    \"node_name\",\n    node_function,\n    cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=120),\n)\n\nThen, to enable node-level caching for a graph, set the cache argument when compiling the graph. The example below uses InMemoryCache to set up a graph with in-memory cache, but SqliteCache is also available.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache\n\ngraph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())\n\n�\nCreate a sequence of steps\nPrerequisites This guide assumes familiarity with the above section on state.\nHere we demonstrate how to construct a simple sequence of steps. We will show:\nHow to build a sequential graph\nBuilt-in short-hand for constructing similar graphs.\nTo add a sequence of nodes, we use the add_node and add_edge methods of our graph:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\n\n# Add nodes\nbuilder.add_node(step_1)\nbuilder.add_node(step_2)\nbuilder.add_node(step_3)\n\n# Add edges\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"step_1\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_1\", \"step_2\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_2\", \"step_3\")\n\nWe can also use the built-in shorthand .add_sequence:\nCopy\nbuilder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"step_1\")\n\n\nWhy split application steps into a sequence with LangGraph?\n\n�\nCreate branches\nParallel execution of nodes is essential to speed up overall graph operation. LangGraph offers native support for parallel execution of nodes, which can significantly enhance the performance of graph-based workflows. This parallelization is achieved through fan-out and fan-in mechanisms, utilizing both standard edges and conditional_edges. Below are some examples showing how to add create branching dataflows that work for you.\n�\nRun graph nodes in parallel\nIn this example, we fan out from Node A to B and C and then fan in to D. With our state, we specify the reducer add operation. This will combine or accumulate values for the specific key in the State, rather than simply overwriting the existing value. For lists, this means concatenating the new list with the existing list. See the above section on state reducers for more detail on updating state with reducers.\nCopy\nimport operator\nfrom typing import Annotated, Any\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only\n    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]\n\ndef a(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"A\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"A\"]}\n\ndef b(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"B\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"B\"]}\n\ndef c(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"C\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"C\"]}\n\ndef d(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"D\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"D\"]}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(a)\nbuilder.add_node(b)\nbuilder.add_node(c)\nbuilder.add_node(d)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"a\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"a\", \"b\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"a\", \"c\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b\", \"d\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"c\", \"d\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"d\", END)\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nWith the reducer, you can see that the values added in each node are accumulated.\nCopy\ngraph.invoke({\"aggregate\": []}, {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"foo\"}})\n\nCopy\nAdding \"A\" to []\nAdding \"B\" to ['A']\nAdding \"C\" to ['A']\nAdding \"D\" to ['A', 'B', 'C']\n\nIn the above example, nodes \"b\" and \"c\" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. Because they are in the same step, node \"d\" executes after both \"b\" and \"c\" are finished.\nImportantly, updates from a parallel superstep may not be ordered consistently. If you need a consistent, predetermined ordering of updates from a parallel superstep, you should write the outputs to a separate field in the state together with a value with which to order them.\n\nException handling?\n\nSet max concurrency You can control the maximum number of concurrent tasks by setting max_concurrency in the configuration when invoking the graph.\nCopy\ngraph.invoke({\"value_1\": \"c\"}, {\"configurable\": {\"max_concurrency\": 10}})\n\n�\nDefer node execution\nDeferring node execution is useful when you want to delay the execution of a node until all other pending tasks are completed. This is particularly relevant when branches have different lengths, which is common in workflows like map-reduce flows.\nThe above example showed how to fan-out and fan-in when each path was only one step. But what if one branch had more than one step? Let’s add a node \"b_2\" in the \"b\" branch:\nCopy\nimport operator\nfrom typing import Annotated, Any\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only\n    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]\n\ndef a(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"A\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"A\"]}\n\ndef b(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"B\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"B\"]}\n\ndef b_2(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"B_2\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"B_2\"]}\n\ndef c(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"C\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"C\"]}\n\ndef d(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"D\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"D\"]}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(a)\nbuilder.add_node(b)\nbuilder.add_node(b_2)\nbuilder.add_node(c)\nbuilder.add_node(d, defer=True)  \nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"a\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"a\", \"b\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"a\", \"c\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b\", \"b_2\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b_2\", \"d\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"c\", \"d\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"d\", END)\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nCopy\ngraph.invoke({\"aggregate\": []})\n\nCopy\nAdding \"A\" to []\nAdding \"B\" to ['A']\nAdding \"C\" to ['A']\nAdding \"B_2\" to ['A', 'B', 'C']\nAdding \"D\" to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2']\n\nIn the above example, nodes \"b\" and \"c\" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. We set defer=True on node d so it will not execute until all pending tasks are finished. In this case, this means that \"d\" waits to execute until the entire \"b\" branch is finished.\n�\nConditional branching\nIf your fan-out should vary at runtime based on the state, you can use add_conditional_edges to select one or more paths using the graph state. See example below, where node a generates a state update that determines the following node.\nCopy\nimport operator\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal, Sequence\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]\n    # Add a key to the state. We will set this key to determine\n    # how we branch.\n    which: str\n\ndef a(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"A\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"A\"], \"which\": \"c\"}  \n\ndef b(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"B\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"B\"]}\n\ndef c(state: State):\n    print(f'Adding \"C\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"C\"]}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(a)\nbuilder.add_node(b)\nbuilder.add_node(c)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"a\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b\", END)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"c\", END)\n\ndef conditional_edge(state: State) -> Literal[\"b\", \"c\"]:\n    # Fill in arbitrary logic here that uses the state\n    # to determine the next node\n    return state[\"which\"]\n\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"a\", conditional_edge)  \n\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nCopy\nresult = graph.invoke({\"aggregate\": []})\nprint(result)\n\nCopy\nAdding \"A\" to []\nAdding \"C\" to ['A']\n{'aggregate': ['A', 'C'], 'which': 'c'}\n\nYour conditional edges can route to multiple destination nodes. For example:\nCopy\ndef route_bc_or_cd(state: State) -> Sequence[str]:\n    if state[\"which\"] == \"cd\":\n        return [\"c\", \"d\"]\n    return [\"b\", \"c\"]\n\n�\nMap-Reduce and the send API\nLangGraph supports map-reduce and other advanced branching patterns using the Send API. Here is an example of how to use it:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.types import Send\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict, Annotated\nimport operator\n\nclass OverallState(TypedDict):\n    topic: str\n    subjects: list[str]\n    jokes: Annotated[list[str], operator.add]\n    best_selected_joke: str\n\ndef generate_topics(state: OverallState):\n    return {\"subjects\": [\"lions\", \"elephants\", \"penguins\"]}\n\ndef generate_joke(state: OverallState):\n    joke_map = {\n        \"lions\": \"Why don't lions like fast food? Because they can't catch it!\",\n        \"elephants\": \"Why don't elephants use computers? They're afraid of the mouse!\",\n        \"penguins\": \"Why don't penguins like talking to strangers at parties? Because they find it hard to break the ice.\"\n    }\n    return {\"jokes\": [joke_map[state[\"subject\"]]]}\n\ndef continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):\n    return [Send(\"generate_joke\", {\"subject\": s}) for s in state[\"subjects\"]]\n\ndef best_joke(state: OverallState):\n    return {\"best_selected_joke\": \"penguins\"}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState)\nbuilder.add_node(\"generate_topics\", generate_topics)\nbuilder.add_node(\"generate_joke\", generate_joke)\nbuilder.add_node(\"best_joke\", best_joke)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"generate_topics\")\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"generate_topics\", continue_to_jokes, [\"generate_joke\"])\nbuilder.add_edge(\"generate_joke\", \"best_joke\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"best_joke\", END)\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nCopy\n# Call the graph: here we call it to generate a list of jokes\nfor step in graph.stream({\"topic\": \"animals\"}):\n    print(step)\n\nCopy\n{'generate_topics': {'subjects': ['lions', 'elephants', 'penguins']}}\n{'generate_joke': {'jokes': [\"Why don't lions like fast food? Because they can't catch it!\"]}}\n{'generate_joke': {'jokes': [\"Why don't elephants use computers? They're afraid of the mouse!\"]}}\n{'generate_joke': {'jokes': ['Why don't penguins like talking to strangers at parties? Because they find it hard to break the ice.']}}\n{'best_joke': {'best_selected_joke': 'penguins'}}\n\n�\nCreate and control loops\nWhen creating a graph with a loop, we require a mechanism for terminating execution. This is most commonly done by adding a conditional edge that routes to the END node once we reach some termination condition.\nYou can also set the graph recursion limit when invoking or streaming the graph. The recursion limit sets the number of supersteps that the graph is allowed to execute before it raises an error. Read more about the concept of recursion limits here.\nLet’s consider a simple graph with a loop to better understand how these mechanisms work.\nTo return the last value of your state instead of receiving a recursion limit error, see the next section.\nWhen creating a loop, you can include a conditional edge that specifies a termination condition:\nCopy\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(a)\nbuilder.add_node(b)\n\ndef route(state: State) -> Literal[\"b\", END]:\n    if termination_condition(state):\n        return END\n    else:\n        return \"b\"\n\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"a\")\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"a\", route)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b\", \"a\")\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nTo control the recursion limit, specify \"recursionLimit\" in the config. This will raise a GraphRecursionError, which you can catch and handle:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError\n\ntry:\n    graph.invoke(inputs, {\"recursion_limit\": 3})\nexcept GraphRecursionError:\n    print(\"Recursion Error\")\n\nLet’s define a graph with a simple loop. Note that we use a conditional edge to implement a termination condition.\nCopy\nimport operator\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only\n    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]\n\ndef a(state: State):\n    print(f'Node A sees {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"A\"]}\n\ndef b(state: State):\n    print(f'Node B sees {state[\"aggregate\"]}')\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"B\"]}\n\n# Define nodes\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(a)\nbuilder.add_node(b)\n\n# Define edges\ndef route(state: State) -> Literal[\"b\", END]:\n    if len(state[\"aggregate\"]) < 7:\n        return \"b\"\n    else:\n        return END\n\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"a\")\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"a\", route)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b\", \"a\")\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nThis architecture is similar to a ReAct agent in which node \"a\" is a tool-calling model, and node \"b\" represents the tools.\nIn our route conditional edge, we specify that we should end after the \"aggregate\" list in the state passes a threshold length.\nInvoking the graph, we see that we alternate between nodes \"a\" and \"b\" before terminating once we reach the termination condition.\nCopy\ngraph.invoke({\"aggregate\": []})\n\nCopy\nNode A sees []\nNode B sees ['A']\nNode A sees ['A', 'B']\nNode B sees ['A', 'B', 'A']\nNode A sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']\nNode B sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']\nNode A sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B']\n\n�\nImpose a recursion limit\nIn some applications, we may not have a guarantee that we will reach a given termination condition. In these cases, we can set the graph’s recursion limit. This will raise a GraphRecursionError after a given number of supersteps. We can then catch and handle this exception:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError\n\ntry:\n    graph.invoke({\"aggregate\": []}, {\"recursion_limit\": 4})\nexcept GraphRecursionError:\n    print(\"Recursion Error\")\n\nCopy\nNode A sees []\nNode B sees ['A']\nNode C sees ['A', 'B']\nNode D sees ['A', 'B']\nNode A sees ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\nRecursion Error\n\n\nExtended example: return state on hitting recursion limit\n\nExtended example: loops with branches\n\n�\nAsync\nUsing the async programming paradigm can produce significant performance improvements when running IO-bound code concurrently (e.g., making concurrent API requests to a chat model provider).\nTo convert a sync implementation of the graph to an async implementation, you will need to:\nUpdate nodes use async def instead of def.\nUpdate the code inside to use await appropriately.\nInvoke the graph with .ainvoke or .astream as desired.\nBecause many LangChain objects implement the Runnable Protocol which has async variants of all the sync methods it’s typically fairly quick to upgrade a sync graph to an async graph.\nSee example below. To demonstrate async invocations of underlying LLMs, we will include a chat model:\nOpenAI\nAnthropic\nAzure\nGoogle Gemini\nAWS Bedrock\nHuggingFace\n👉 Read the OpenAI chat model integration docs\nCopy\npip install -U \"langchain[openai]\"\n\ninit_chat_model\nModel Class\nCopy\nimport os\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\n\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4.1\")\n\nCopy\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph\n\nasync def node(state: MessagesState):  \n    new_message = await llm.ainvoke(state[\"messages\"])  \n    return {\"messages\": [new_message]}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(MessagesState).add_node(node).set_entry_point(\"node\")\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\ninput_message = {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}\nresult = await graph.ainvoke({\"messages\": [input_message]})  \n\nAsync streaming See the streaming guide for examples of streaming with async.\n�\nCombine control flow and state updates with Command\nIt can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:\nCopy\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        # state update\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\n        # control flow\n        goto=\"my_other_node\"\n    )\n\nWe show an end-to-end example below. Let’s create a simple graph with 3 nodes: A, B and C. We will first execute node A, and then decide whether to go to Node B or Node C next based on the output of node A.\nCopy\nimport random\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict, Literal\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\n\n# Define graph state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n\n# Define the nodes\n\ndef node_a(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"]]:\n    print(\"Called A\")\n    value = random.choice([\"b\", \"c\"])\n    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function\n    if value == \"b\":\n        goto = \"node_b\"\n    else:\n        goto = \"node_c\"\n\n    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node\n    return Command(\n        # this is the state update\n        update={\"foo\": value},\n        # this is a replacement for an edge\n        goto=goto,\n    )\n\ndef node_b(state: State):\n    print(\"Called B\")\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"foo\"] + \"b\"}\n\ndef node_c(state: State):\n    print(\"Called C\")\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"foo\"] + \"c\"}\n\nWe can now create the StateGraph with the above nodes. Notice that the graph doesn’t have conditional edges for routing! This is because control flow is defined with Command inside node_a.\nCopy\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\nbuilder.add_node(node_a)\nbuilder.add_node(node_b)\nbuilder.add_node(node_c)\n# NOTE: there are no edges between nodes A, B and C!\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nYou might have noticed that we used Command as a return type annotation, e.g. Command[Literal[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that node_a can navigate to node_b and node_c.\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import display, Image\n\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nIf we run the graph multiple times, we’d see it take different paths (A -> B or A -> C) based on the random choice in node A.\nCopy\ngraph.invoke({\"foo\": \"\"})\n\nCopy\nCalled A\nCalled C\n\n�\nNavigate to a node in a parent graph\nIf you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:\nCopy\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\n        goto=\"other_subgraph\",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph\n        graph=Command.PARENT\n    )\n\nLet’s demonstrate this using the above example. We’ll do so by changing nodeA in the above example into a single-node graph that we’ll add as a subgraph to our parent graph.\nState updates with Command.PARENT When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that’s shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you’re updating in the parent graph state. See the example below.\nCopy\nimport operator\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    # NOTE: we define a reducer here\n    foo: Annotated[str, operator.add]  \n\ndef node_a(state: State):\n    print(\"Called A\")\n    value = random.choice([\"a\", \"b\"])\n    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function\n    if value == \"a\":\n        goto = \"node_b\"\n    else:\n        goto = \"node_c\"\n\n    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node\n    return Command(\n        update={\"foo\": value},\n        goto=goto,\n        # this tells LangGraph to navigate to node_b or node_c in the parent graph\n        # NOTE: this will navigate to the closest parent graph relative to the subgraph\n        graph=Command.PARENT,  \n    )\n\nsubgraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node_a).add_edge(START, \"node_a\").compile()\n\ndef node_b(state: State):\n    print(\"Called B\")\n    # NOTE: since we've defined a reducer, we don't need to manually append\n    # new characters to existing 'foo' value. instead, reducer will append these\n    # automatically (via operator.add)\n    return {\"foo\": \"b\"}  \n\ndef node_c(state: State):\n    print(\"Called C\")\n    return {\"foo\": \"c\"}  \n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"subgraph\")\nbuilder.add_node(\"subgraph\", subgraph)\nbuilder.add_node(node_b)\nbuilder.add_node(node_c)\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\nCopy\ngraph.invoke({\"foo\": \"\"})\n\nCopy\nCalled A\nCalled C\n\n�\nUse inside tools\nA common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation. To update the graph state from the tool, you can return Command(update={\"my_custom_key\": \"foo\", \"messages\": [...]}) from the tool:\nCopy\n@tool\ndef lookup_user_info(tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId], config: RunnableConfig):\n    \"\"\"Use this to look up user information to better assist them with their questions.\"\"\"\n    user_info = get_user_info(config.get(\"configurable\", {}).get(\"user_id\"))\n    return Command(\n        update={\n            # update the state keys\n            \"user_info\": user_info,\n            # update the message history\n            \"messages\": [ToolMessage(\"Successfully looked up user information\", tool_call_id=tool_call_id)]\n        }\n    )\n\nYou MUST include messages (or any state key used for the message history) in Command.update when returning Command from a tool and the list of messages in messages MUST contain a ToolMessage. This is necessary for the resulting message history to be valid (LLM providers require AI messages with tool calls to be followed by the tool result messages).\nIf you are using tools that update state via Command, we recommend using prebuilt ToolNode which automatically handles tools returning Command objects and propagates them to the graph state. If you’re writing a custom node that calls tools, you would need to manually propagate Command objects returned by the tools as the update from the node.\n�\nVisualize your graph\nHere we demonstrate how to visualize the graphs you create.\nYou can visualize any arbitrary Graph, including StateGraph.\nLet’s have some fun by drawing fractals :).\nCopy\nimport random\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n\nclass MyNode:\n    def __init__(self, name: str):\n        self.name = name\n    def __call__(self, state: State):\n        return {\"messages\": [(\"assistant\", f\"Called node {self.name}\")]}\n\ndef route(state) -> Literal[\"entry_node\", END]:\n    if len(state[\"messages\"]) > 10:\n        return END\n    return \"entry_node\"\n\ndef add_fractal_nodes(builder, current_node, level, max_level):\n    if level > max_level:\n        return\n    # Number of nodes to create at this level\n    num_nodes = random.randint(1, 3)  # Adjust randomness as needed\n    for i in range(num_nodes):\n        nm = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"][i]\n        node_name = f\"node_{current_node}_{nm}\"\n        builder.add_node(node_name, MyNode(node_name))\n        builder.add_edge(current_node, node_name)\n        # Recursively add more nodes\n        r = random.random()\n        if r > 0.2 and level + 1 < max_level:\n            add_fractal_nodes(builder, node_name, level + 1, max_level)\n        elif r > 0.05:\n            builder.add_conditional_edges(node_name, route, node_name)\n        else:\n            # End\n            builder.add_edge(node_name, END)\n\ndef build_fractal_graph(max_level: int):\n    builder = StateGraph(State)\n    entry_point = \"entry_node\"\n    builder.add_node(entry_point, MyNode(entry_point))\n    builder.add_edge(START, entry_point)\n    add_fractal_nodes(builder, entry_point, 1, max_level)\n    # Optional: set a finish point if required\n    builder.add_edge(entry_point, END)  # or any specific node\n    return builder.compile()\n\napp = build_fractal_graph(3)\n\n�\nMermaid\nWe can also convert a graph class into Mermaid syntax.\nCopy\nprint(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid())\n\nCopy\n%%{init: {'flowchart': {'curve': 'linear'}}}%%\ngraph TD;\n    tart__([<p>__start__</p>]):::first\n    ry_node(entry_node)\n    e_entry_node_A(node_entry_node_A)\n    e_entry_node_B(node_entry_node_B)\n    e_node_entry_node_B_A(node_node_entry_node_B_A)\n    e_node_entry_node_B_B(node_node_entry_node_B_B)\n    e_node_entry_node_B_C(node_node_entry_node_B_C)\n    nd__([<p>__end__</p>]):::last\n    tart__ --> entry_node;\n    ry_node --> __end__;\n    ry_node --> node_entry_node_A;\n    ry_node --> node_entry_node_B;\n    e_entry_node_B --> node_node_entry_node_B_A;\n    e_entry_node_B --> node_node_entry_node_B_B;\n    e_entry_node_B --> node_node_entry_node_B_C;\n    e_entry_node_A -.-> entry_node;\n    e_entry_node_A -.-> __end__;\n    e_node_entry_node_B_A -.-> entry_node;\n    e_node_entry_node_B_A -.-> __end__;\n    e_node_entry_node_B_B -.-> entry_node;\n    e_node_entry_node_B_B -.-> __end__;\n    e_node_entry_node_B_C -.-> entry_node;\n    e_node_entry_node_B_C -.-> __end__;\n    ssDef default fill:#f2f0ff,line-height:1.2\n    ssDef first fill-opacity:0\n    ssDef last fill:#bfb6fc\n\n�\nPNG\nIf preferred, we could render the Graph into a .png. Here we could use three options:\nUsing Mermaid.ink API (does not require additional packages)\nUsing Mermaid + Pyppeteer (requires pip install pyppeteer)\nUsing graphviz (which requires pip install graphviz)\nUsing Mermaid.Ink\nBy default, draw_mermaid_png() uses Mermaid.Ink’s API to generate the diagram.\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\nfrom langchain_core.runnables.graph import CurveStyle, MermaidDrawMethod, NodeStyles\n\ndisplay(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nUsing Mermaid + Pyppeteer\nCopy\nimport nest_asyncio\n\nnest_asyncio.apply()  # Required for Jupyter Notebook to run async functions\n\ndisplay(\n    Image(\n        app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(\n            curve_style=CurveStyle.LINEAR,\n            node_colors=NodeStyles(first=\"#ffdfba\", last=\"#baffc9\", default=\"#fad7de\"),\n            wrap_label_n_words=9,\n            output_file_path=None,\n            draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.PYPPETEER,\n            background_color=\"white\",\n            padding=10,\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nUsing Graphviz\nCopy\ntry:\n    display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_png()))\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\n        \"You likely need to install dependencies for pygraphviz, see more here https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/blob/main/INSTALL.txt\"\n    )\n\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nDocs by LangChain home page\n\nResources\n\nForum\nChangelog\nLangChain Academy\nTrust Center\n\nCompany\n\nHome\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\ngithub\nx\nlinkedin\nyoutube\nPowered by"

To pass multiple inputs, you can use a dictionary.\nCopy\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\n    value = inputs[\"value\"]\n    another_value = inputs[\"another_value\"]\n    ...\n\nmy_workflow.invoke({\"value\": 1, \"another_value\": 2})\n\n\nExtended example: simple workflow\n\nExtended example: Compose an essay with an LLM\n\n�\nParallel execution\nTasks can be executed in parallel by invoking them concurrently and waiting for the results. This is useful for improving performance in IO bound tasks (e.g., calling APIs for LLMs).\nCopy\n@task\ndef add_one(number: int) -> int:\n    return number + 1\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef graph(numbers: list[int]) -> list[str]:\n    futures = [add_one(i) for i in numbers]\n    return [f.result() for f in futures]\n\n\nExtended example: parallel LLM calls\n\n�\nCalling graphs\nThe Functional API and the Graph API can be used together in the same application as they share the same underlying runtime.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\nbuilder = StateGraph()\n...\nsome_graph = builder.compile()\n\n@entrypoint()\ndef some_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:\n    # Call a graph defined using the graph API\n    result_1 = some_graph.invoke(...)\n    # Call another graph defined using the graph API\n    result_2 = another_graph.invoke(...)\n    return {\n        \"result_1\": result_1,\n        \"result_2\": result_2\n    }\n\n\nExtended example: calling a simple graph from the functional API\n\n�\nCall other entrypoints\nYou can call other entrypoints from within an entrypoint or a task.\nCopy\n@entrypoint() # Will automatically use the checkpointer from the parent entrypoint\ndef some_other_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\n    return inputs[\"value\"]\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\n    value = some_other_workflow.invoke({\"value\": 1})\n    return value\n\n\nExtended example: calling another entrypoint\n\n�\nStreaming\nThe Functional API uses the same streaming mechanism as the Graph API. Please read the streaming guide section for more details.\nExample of using the streaming API to stream both updates and custom data.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.config import get_stream_writer   \n\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef main(inputs: dict) -> int:\n    writer = get_stream_writer()   \n    writer(\"Started processing\")   \n    result = inputs[\"x\"] * 2\n    writer(f\"Result is {result}\")   \n    return result\n\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc\"}}\n\nfor mode, chunk in main.stream(   \n    {\"x\": 5},\n    stream_mode=[\"custom\", \"updates\"],   \n    config=config\n):\n    print(f\"{mode}: {chunk}\")\n\nImport get_stream_writer from langgraph.config.\nObtain a stream writer instance within the entrypoint.\nEmit custom data before computation begins.\nEmit another custom message after computing the result.\nUse .stream() to process streamed output.\nSpecify which streaming modes to use.\nCopy\n('updates', {'add_one': 2})\n('updates', {'add_two': 3})\n('custom', 'hello')\n('custom', 'world')\n('updates', {'main': 5})\n\nAsync with Python < 3.11 If using Python < 3.11 and writing async code, using get_stream_writer will not work.

When resuming, append human input.\nAppend \"qux\".\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint, task\nfrom langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n\n\n@task\ndef step_1(input_query):\n    \"\"\"Append bar.\"\"\"\n    return f\"{input_query} bar\"\n\n\n@task\ndef human_feedback(input_query):\n    \"\"\"Append user input.\"\"\"\n    feedback = interrupt(f\"Please provide feedback: {input_query}\")\n    return f\"{input_query} {feedback}\"\n\n\n@task\ndef step_3(input_query):\n    \"\"\"Append qux.\"\"\"\n    return f\"{input_query} qux\"\n\nWe can now compose these tasks in an entrypoint:\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\n\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef graph(input_query):\n    result_1 = step_1(input_query).result()\n    result_2 = human_feedback(result_1).result()\n    result_3 = step_3(result_2).result()\n\n    return result_3\n\ninterrupt() is called inside a task, enabling a human to review and edit the output of the previous task. The results of prior tasks— in this case step_1— are persisted, so that they are not run again following the interrupt.\nLet’s send in a query string:\nCopy\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n\nfor event in graph.stream(\"foo\", config):\n    print(event)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\nNote that we’ve paused with an interrupt after step_1. The interrupt provides instructions to resume the run. To resume, we issue a Command containing the data expected by the human_feedback task.\nCopy\n# Continue execution\nfor event in graph.stream(Command(resume=\"baz\"), config):\n    print(event)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\nAfter resuming, the run proceeds through the remaining step and terminates as expected.\n�\nReview tool calls\nTo review tool calls before execution, we add a review_tool_call function that calls interrupt. When this function is called, execution will be paused until we issue a command to resume it.\nGiven a tool call, our function will interrupt for human review. At that point we can either:\nAccept the tool call\nRevise the tool call and continue\nGenerate a custom tool message (e.g., instructing the model to re-format its tool call)\nCopy\nfrom typing import Union\n\ndef review_tool_call(tool_call: ToolCall) -> Union[ToolCall, ToolMessage]:\n    \"\"\"Review a tool call, returning a validated version.\"\"\"\n    human_review = interrupt(\n        {\n            \"question\": \"Is this correct?\",\n            \"tool_call\": tool_call,\n        }\n    )\n    review_action = human_review[\"action\"]\n    review_data = human_review.get(\"data\")\n    if review_action == \"continue\":\n        return tool_call\n    elif review_action == \"update\":\n        updated_tool_call = {**tool_call, **{\"args\": review_data}}\n        return updated_tool_call\n    elif review_action == \"feedback\":\n        return ToolMessage(\n            content=review_data, name=tool_call[\"name\"], tool_call_id=tool_call[\"id\"]\n        )\n\nWe can now update our entrypoint to review the generated tool calls. If a tool call is accepted or revised, we execute in the same way as before. Otherwise, we just append the ToolMessage supplied by the human. The results of prior tasks — in this case the initial model call — are persisted, so that they are not run again following the interrupt.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\nfrom langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n\n\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\n\n\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\ndef agent(messages, previous):\n    if previous is not None:\n        messages = add_messages(previous, messages)\n\n    model_response = call_model(messages).result()\n    while True:\n        if not model_response.tool_calls:\n            break\n\n        # Review tool calls\n        tool_results = []\n        tool_calls = []\n        for i, tool_call in enumerate(model_response.tool_calls):\n            review = review_tool_call(tool_call)\n            if isinstance(review, ToolMessage):\n                tool_results.append(review)\n            else:  # is a validated tool call\n                tool_calls.append(review)\n                if review != tool_call:\n                    model_response.tool_calls[i] = review  # update message\n\n        # Execute remaining tool calls\n        tool_result_futures = [call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in tool_calls]\n        remaining_tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]\n\n        # Append to message list\n        messages = add_messages(\n            messages,\n            [model_response, *tool_results, *remaining_tool_results],\n        )\n\n        # Call model again\n        model_response = call_model(messages).result()\n\n    # Generate final response\n    messages = add_messages(messages, model_response)\n    return entrypoint.final(value=model_response, save=messages)\n\n�\nShort-term memory\nShort-term memory allows storing information across different invocations of the same thread id.

If deeper customization is required, agents can be implemented directly in LangGraph. This guide demonstrates an example implementation of a SQL agent. You can find a tutorial building a SQL agent using higher-level LangChain abstractions here.\nBuilding Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your agent’s needs. This will mitigate, though not eliminate, the risks of building a model-driven system.\nThe prebuilt agent lets us get started quickly, but we relied on the system prompt to constrain its behavior— for example, we instructed the agent to always start with the “list tables” tool, and to always run a query-checker tool before executing the query.\nWe can enforce a higher degree of control in LangGraph by customizing the agent. Here, we implement a simple ReAct-agent setup, with dedicated nodes for specific tool-calls. We will use the same [state] as the pre-built agent.\n�\nConcepts\nWe will cover the following concepts:\nTools for reading from SQL databases\nThe LangGraph Graph API, including state, nodes, edges, and conditional edges.\nHuman-in-the-loop processes\n�\nSetup\n�\nInstallation\npip\nCopy\npip install langchain  langgraph  langchain-community\n\n�\nLangSmith\nSet up LangSmith to inspect what is happening inside your chain or agent. Then set the following environment variables:\nCopy\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\nexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\n\n�\n1. Select an LLM\nSelect a model that supports tool-calling:\nOpenAI\nAnthropic\nAzure\nGoogle Gemini\nAWS Bedrock\nHuggingFace\n👉 Read the OpenAI chat model integration docs\nCopy\npip install -U \"langchain[openai]\"\n\ninit_chat_model\nModel Class\nCopy\nimport os\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\n\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4.1\")\n\nThe output shown in the examples below used OpenAI.\n�\n2. Configure the database\nYou will be creating a SQLite database for this tutorial. SQLite is a lightweight database that is easy to set up and use. We will be loading the chinook database, which is a sample database that represents a digital media store.\nFor convenience, we have hosted the database (Chinook.db) on a public GCS bucket.\nCopy\nimport requests, pathlib\n\nurl = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/benchmarks-artifacts/chinook/Chinook.db\"\nlocal_path = pathlib.Path(\"Chinook.db\")\n\nif local_path.exists():\n    print(f\"{local_path} already exists, skipping download.\")\nelse:\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        local_path.write_bytes(response.content)\n        print(f\"File downloaded and saved as {local_path}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Failed to download the file. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n\nWe will use a handy SQL database wrapper available in the langchain_community package to interact with the database. The wrapper provides a simple interface to execute SQL queries and fetch results:\nCopy\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\")\n\nprint(f\"Dialect: {db.dialect}\")\nprint(f\"Available tables: {db.get_usable_table_names()}\")\nprint(f'Sample output: {db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 5;\")}')\n\nCopy\nDialect: sqlite\nAvailable tables: ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\nSample output: [(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains')]\n\n�\n3. Add tools for database interactions\nUse the SQLDatabase wrapper available in the langchain_community package to interact with the database. The wrapper provides a simple interface to execute SQL queries and fetch results:\nCopy\nfrom langchain_community.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit\n\ntoolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=model)\n\ntools = toolkit.get_tools()\n\nfor tool in tools:\n    print(f\"{tool.name}: {tool.description}\\n\")\n\nCopy\nsql_db_query: Input to this tool is a detailed and correct SQL query, output is a result from the database. If the query is not correct, an error message will be returned. If an error is returned, rewrite the query, check the query, and try again. If you encounter an issue with Unknown column 'xxxx' in 'field list', use sql_db_schema to query the correct table fields.\n\nsql_db_schema: Input to this tool is a comma-separated list of tables, output is the schema and sample rows for those tables. Be sure that the tables actually exist by calling sql_db_list_tables first! Example Input: table1, table2, table3\n\nsql_db_list_tables: Input is an empty string, output is a comma-separated list of tables in the database.\n\nsql_db_query_checker: Use this tool to double check if your query is correct before executing it. Always use this tool before executing a query with sql_db_query!\n\n�\n4. Define application steps\nWe construct dedicated nodes for the following steps:\nListing DB tables\nCalling the “get schema” tool\nGenerating a query\nChecking the query\nPutting these steps in dedicated nodes lets us (1) force tool-calls when needed, and (2) customize the prompts associated with each step.\nCopy\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nfrom langchain.messages import AIMessage\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, START, MessagesState, StateGraph\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\n\n\nget_schema_tool = next(tool for tool in tools if tool.name == \"sql_db_schema\")\nget_schema_node = ToolNode([get_schema_tool], name=\"get_schema\")\n\nrun_query_tool = next(tool for tool in tools if tool.name == \"sql_db_query\")\nrun_query_node = ToolNode([run_query_tool], name=\"run_query\")\n\n\n# Example: create a predetermined tool call\ndef list_tables(state: MessagesState):\n    tool_call = {\n        \"name\": \"sql_db_list_tables\",\n        \"args\": {},\n        \"id\": \"abc123\",\n        \"type\": \"tool_call\",\n    }\n    tool_call_message = AIMessage(content=\"\", tool_calls=[tool_call])\n\n    list_tables_tool = next(tool for tool in tools if tool.name == \"sql_db_list_tables\")\n    tool_message = list_tables_tool.invoke(tool_call)\n    response = AIMessage(f\"Available tables: {tool_message.content}\")\n\n    return {\"messages\": [tool_call_message, tool_message, response]}\n\n\n# Example: force a model to create a tool call\ndef call_get_schema(state: MessagesState):\n    # Note that LangChain enforces that all models accept `tool_choice=\"any\"`\n    # as well as `tool_choice=<string name of tool>`.\n    llm_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_schema_tool], tool_choice=\"any\")\n    response = llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])\n\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\n\ngenerate_query_system_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are an agent designed to interact with a SQL database.\nGiven an input question, create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run,\nthen look at the results of the query and return the answer.

Implement the agent\nWe can now assemble these steps into a workflow using the Graph API. We define a conditional edge at the query generation step that will route to the query checker if a query is generated, or end if there are no tool calls present, such that the LLM has delivered a response to the query.\nCopy\ndef should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal[END, \"check_query\"]:\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    last_message = messages[-1]\n    if not last_message.tool_calls:\n        return END\n    else:\n        return \"check_query\"\n\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(MessagesState)\nbuilder.add_node(list_tables)\nbuilder.add_node(call_get_schema)\nbuilder.add_node(get_schema_node, \"get_schema\")\nbuilder.add_node(generate_query)\nbuilder.add_node(check_query)\nbuilder.add_node(run_query_node, \"run_query\")\n\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"list_tables\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"list_tables\", \"call_get_schema\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"call_get_schema\", \"get_schema\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"get_schema\", \"generate_query\")\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"generate_query\",\n    should_continue,\n)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"check_query\", \"run_query\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"run_query\", \"generate_query\")\n\nagent = builder.compile()\n\nWe visualize the application below:\nCopy\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\nfrom langchain_core.runnables.graph import CurveStyle, MermaidDrawMethod, NodeStyles\n\ndisplay(Image(agent.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n\nWe can now invoke the graph:\nCopy\nquestion = \"Which genre on average has the longest tracks?\"\n\nfor step in agent.stream(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": question}]},\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\n):\n    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\n\nCopy\n================================ Human Message =================================\n\nWhich genre on average has the longest tracks?\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nAvailable tables: Album, Artist, Customer, Employee, Genre, Invoice, InvoiceLine, MediaType, Playlist, PlaylistTrack, Track\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nTool Calls:\n  sql_db_schema (call_yzje0tj7JK3TEzDx4QnRR3lL)\n Call ID: call_yzje0tj7JK3TEzDx4QnRR3lL\n  Args:\n    table_names: Genre, Track\n================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: sql_db_schema\n\n\nCREATE TABLE \"Genre\" (\n\t\"GenreId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\t\"Name\" NVARCHAR(120),\n\tPRIMARY KEY (\"GenreId\")\n)\n\n/*\n3 rows from Genre table:\nGenreId\tName\n1\tRock\n2\tJazz\n3\tMetal\n*/\n\n\nCREATE TABLE \"Track\" (\n\t\"TrackId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\t\"Name\" NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,\n\t\"AlbumId\" INTEGER,\n\t\"MediaTypeId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\t\"GenreId\" INTEGER,\n\t\"Composer\" NVARCHAR(220),\n\t\"Milliseconds\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\t\"Bytes\" INTEGER,\n\t\"UnitPrice\" NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n\tPRIMARY KEY (\"TrackId\"),\n\tFOREIGN KEY(\"MediaTypeId\") REFERENCES \"MediaType\" (\"MediaTypeId\"),\n\tFOREIGN KEY(\"GenreId\") REFERENCES \"Genre\" (\"GenreId\"),\n\tFOREIGN KEY(\"AlbumId\") REFERENCES \"Album\" (\"AlbumId\")\n)\n\n/*\n3 rows from Track table:\nTrackId\tName\tAlbumId\tMediaTypeId\tGenreId\tComposer\tMilliseconds\tBytes\tUnitPrice\n1\tFor Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\t1\t1\t1\tAngus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson\t343719\t11170334\t0.99\n2\tBalls to the Wall\t2\t2\t1\tU.

Implement human-in-the-loop review\nIt can be prudent to check the agent’s SQL queries before they are executed for any unintended actions or inefficiencies.\nHere we leverage LangGraph’s human-in-the-loop features to pause the run before executing a SQL query and wait for human review. Using LangGraph’s persistence layer, we can pause the run indefinitely (or at least as long as the persistence layer is alive).\nLet’s wrap the sql_db_query tool in a node that receives human input. We can implement this using the interrupt function. Below, we allow for input to approve the tool call, edit its arguments, or provide user feedback.\nCopy\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\n@tool(\n    run_query_tool.name,\n    description=run_query_tool.description,\n    args_schema=run_query_tool.args_schema\n)\ndef run_query_tool_with_interrupt(config: RunnableConfig, **tool_input):\n    request = {\n        \"action\": run_query_tool.name,\n        \"args\": tool_input,\n        \"description\": \"Please review the tool call\"\n    }\n    response = interrupt([request]) \n    # approve the tool call\n    if response[\"type\"] == \"accept\":\n        tool_response = run_query_tool.invoke(tool_input, config)\n    # update tool call args\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"edit\":\n        tool_input = response[\"args\"][\"args\"]\n        tool_response = run_query_tool.invoke(tool_input, config)\n    # respond to the LLM with user feedback\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"response\":\n        user_feedback = response[\"args\"]\n        tool_response = user_feedback\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported interrupt response type: {response['type']}\")\n\n    return tool_response\n\n# Redefine the tool node to use the interrupt version\nrun_query_node = ToolNode([run_query_tool_with_interrupt], name=\"run_query\") \n\nThe above implementation follows the tool interrupt example in the broader human-in-the-loop guide. Refer to that guide for details and alternatives.\nLet’s now re-assemble our graph. We will replace the programmatic check with human review. Note that we now include a checkpointer; this is required to pause and resume the run.\nCopy\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n\ndef should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal[END, \"run_query\"]:\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    last_message = messages[-1]\n    if not last_message.tool_calls:\n        return END\n    else:\n        return \"run_query\"\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(MessagesState)\nbuilder.add_node(list_tables)\nbuilder.add_node(call_get_schema)\nbuilder.add_node(get_schema_node, \"get_schema\")\nbuilder.add_node(generate_query)\nbuilder.add_node(run_query_node, \"run_query\")\n\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"list_tables\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"list_tables\", \"call_get_schema\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"call_get_schema\", \"get_schema\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"get_schema\", \"generate_query\")\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"generate_query\",\n    should_continue,\n)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"run_query\", \"generate_query\")\n\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver() \nagent = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer) \n\nWe can invoke the graph as before.

You are giving them some tools and they can do all kind of crazy\nand they can do all kind of crazy\nand they can do all kind of crazy things. So you need to control them. If\nthings. So you need to control them. If\nthings. So you need to control them. If you plot a chart of agent's level of\nyou plot a chart of agent's level of\nyou plot a chart of agent's level of control to its reliability, as you can\ncontrol to its reliability, as you can\ncontrol to its reliability, as you can see here, as you increase the control,\nsee here, as you increase the control,\nsee here, as you increase the control, the reliability will drop. So if you\nthe reliability will drop. So if you\nthe reliability will drop. So if you have a fully autonomous agent just like\nhave a fully autonomous agent just like\nhave a fully autonomous agent just like that monkey, the reliability will go\nthat monkey, the reliability will go\nthat monkey, the reliability will go down. Okay, this is the general issue\ndown. Okay, this is the general issue\ndown. Okay, this is the general issue with any agents. Lang graph is a\nwith any agents. Lang graph is a\nwith any agents. Lang graph is a framework that will help you increase\nframework that will help you increase\nframework that will help you increase the reliability for agents. Okay.\nthe reliability for agents. Okay.\nthe reliability for agents. Okay. Langraph comes with lot of tools and\nLangraph comes with lot of tools and\nLangraph comes with lot of tools and features which will help you bend this\nfeatures which will help you bend this\nfeatures which will help you bend this graph and you can increase the\ngraph and you can increase the\ngraph and you can increase the reliability of these autonomous agent.\nreliability of these autonomous agent.\nreliability of these autonomous agent. Okay. So it's a framework that helps you\nOkay. So it's a framework that helps you\nOkay. So it's a framework that helps you build reliable agents. Now how it\nbuild reliable agents. Now how it\nbuild reliable agents. Now how it differs from other frameworks such as\ndiffers from other frameworks such as\ndiffers from other frameworks such as Agno, Google ADK and so on. Agno is very\nAgno, Google ADK and so on. Agno is very\nAgno, Google ADK and so on. Agno is very lightweight and fast. Google ADK on the\nlightweight and fast.

Whereas Lang graph provides a more\nWhereas Lang graph provides a more\nWhereas Lang graph provides a more expressive customizable framework to\nexpressive customizable framework to\nexpressive customizable framework to build highly complex agents. Okay. So\nbuild highly complex agents. Okay. So\nbuild highly complex agents. Okay. So it's very customizable. In other\nit's very customizable. In other\nit's very customizable. In other frameworks when I use them personally\nframeworks when I use them personally\nframeworks when I use them personally what I see is it's sort of like a black\nwhat I see is it's sort of like a black\nwhat I see is it's sort of like a black box. Okay. you can't customize things\nbox. Okay. you can't customize things\nbox. Okay. you can't customize things beyond certain points. Whereas in\nbeyond certain points.

We'll go over graph and state and so on.\nWe'll go over graph and state and so on.\nWe'll go over graph and state and so on. I know these things might sound like\nI know these things might sound like\nI know these things might sound like jargon but just in case if you know\njargon but just in case if you know\njargon but just in case if you know about graph data structure and a\nabout graph data structure and a\nabout graph data structure and a stateful orchestration the langraph will\nstateful orchestration the langraph will\nstateful orchestration the langraph will allow you to do that okay it will allow\nallow you to do that okay it will allow\nallow you to do that okay it will allow you to do multi-step workflows with\nyou to do multi-step workflows with\nyou to do multi-step workflows with memory streaming human in the loop\nmemory streaming human in the loop\nmemory streaming human in the loop control some of you might be familiar\ncontrol some of you might be familiar\ncontrol some of you might be familiar with langchain framework and a natural\nwith langchain framework and a natural\nwith langchain framework and a natural question is what is the difference\nquestion is what is the difference\nquestion is what is the difference between these two frameworks well\nbetween these two frameworks well\nbetween these two frameworks well sometimes you want to build AI system\nsometimes you want to build AI system\nsometimes you want to build AI system where let's say you are getting uh data\nwhere let's say you are getting uh data\nwhere let's say you are getting uh data from some database okay in step one then\nfrom some database okay in step one then\nfrom some database okay in step one then you are doing some data cleaning then\nyou are doing some data cleaning then\nyou are doing some data cleaning then you are giving it to LLM for extracting\nyou are giving it to LLM for extracting\nyou are giving it to LLM for extracting some information or summarizing or doing\nsome information or summarizing or doing\nsome information or summarizing or doing some work okay then you are performing\nsome work okay then you are performing\nsome work okay then you are performing some other step then again you're\nsome other step then again you're\nsome other step then again you're calling LLM you can have this kind of a\ncalling LLM you can have this kind of a\ncalling LLM you can have this kind of a workflow system remember workflow from\nworkflow system remember workflow from\nworkflow system remember workflow from that anthropic document so this is that\nthat anthropic document so this is that\nthat anthropic document so this is that same workflow it's a linear workflow\nsame workflow it's a linear workflow\nsame workflow it's a linear workflow which is called a chain and whenever you\nwhich is called a chain and whenever you\nwhich is called a chain and whenever you want to build this kind of workflows,\nwant to build this kind of workflows,\nwant to build this kind of workflows, lang chain framework is ideal and in\nlang chain framework is ideal and in\nlang chain framework is ideal and in fact we have a couple of videos and one\nfact we have a couple of videos and one\nfact we have a couple of videos and one complete YouTube project where we built\ncomplete YouTube project where we built\ncomplete YouTube project where we built uh this kind of chain using lang chain.\nuh this kind of chain using lang chain.\nuh this kind of chain using lang chain. Okay, where we uh retrieved the\nOkay, where we uh retrieved the\nOkay, where we uh retrieved the documents for which we use text loader\ndocuments for which we use text loader\ndocuments for which we use text loader class from lang chain. Okay, so these\nclass from lang chain. Okay, so these\nclass from lang chain. Okay, so these are all the classes and tools provided\nare all the classes and tools provided\nare all the classes and tools provided by langchain frameworks. Langchain\nby langchain frameworks. Langchain\nby langchain frameworks. Langchain frameworks provides so many amazing\nframeworks provides so many amazing\nframeworks provides so many amazing utilities which can be used in langraph\nutilities which can be used in langraph\nutilities which can be used in langraph too. by the way. Okay. So this is one\ntoo. by the way. Okay. So this is one\ntoo. by the way. Okay. So this is one example of a chain that we created in\nexample of a chain that we created in\nexample of a chain that we created in one of our rocky boat project in in\none of our rocky boat project in in\none of our rocky boat project in in YouTube. Okay. So here you will use lang\nYouTube. Okay. So here you will use lang\nYouTube. Okay. So here you will use lang chain. Now when do you use langraph?\nchain. Now when do you use langraph?\nchain. Now when do you use langraph? Well when you have some kind of autonomy\nWell when you have some kind of autonomy\nWell when you have some kind of autonomy that is given to LLM. For example, here\nthat is given to LLM. For example, here\nthat is given to LLM. For example, here you start at some point and LLM will\nyou start at some point and LLM will\nyou start at some point and LLM will decide okay whether it wants to call\ndecide okay whether it wants to call\ndecide okay whether it wants to call step A, step B or whether it wants to\nstep A, step B or whether it wants to\nstep A, step B or whether it wants to make call to LLM, you know, another LLM\nmake call to LLM, you know, another LLM\nmake call to LLM, you know, another LLM and then this LLM will also have some\nand then this LLM will also have some\nand then this LLM will also have some kind of autonomy. It will internally\nkind of autonomy. It will internally\nkind of autonomy. It will internally decide if if it wants to call step C,\ndecide if if it wants to call step C,\ndecide if if it wants to call step C, step D, E, it can also call by the way\nstep D, E, it can also call by the way\nstep D, E, it can also call by the way previous LLM. You see this pathway. So\nprevious LLM. You see this pathway. So\nprevious LLM. You see this pathway. So here this kind of decision control is\nhere this kind of decision control is\nhere this kind of decision control is given to this LLM. It is done by this\ngiven to this LLM. It is done by this\ngiven to this LLM. It is done by this LLM in autonomous way. Okay, autonomy is\nLLM in autonomous way. Okay, autonomy is\nLLM in autonomous way. Okay, autonomy is a keyword folks. So LLM is like a human\na keyword folks. So LLM is like a human\na keyword folks. So LLM is like a human brain, right? It it it is smart. It can\nbrain, right? It it it is smart. It can\nbrain, right? It it it is smart. It can make that decision. You just give\nmake that decision. You just give\nmake that decision. You just give instruction that okay, you are given\ninstruction that okay, you are given\ninstruction that okay, you are given this task and just figure out from this\nthis task and just figure out from this\nthis task and just figure out from this step CD E these three steps and it will\nstep CD E these three steps and it will\nstep CD E these three steps and it will determine it on its own. You're not\ndetermine it on its own. You're not\ndetermine it on its own. You're not going to write some code etc. Okay, I\ngoing to write some code etc. Okay, I\ngoing to write some code etc. Okay, I mean you'll write code for giving a\nmean you'll write code for giving a\nmean you'll write code for giving a prompt but the decision is made by LLM.\nprompt but the decision is made by LLM.\nprompt but the decision is made by LLM. Okay, so here you have a human brain.\nOkay, so here you have a human brain.\nOkay, so here you have a human brain. Here you have a human like like sort of\nHere you have a human like like sort of\nHere you have a human like like sort of like a human brain and it's making all\nlike a human brain and it's making all\nlike a human brain and it's making all these independent decisions and you are\nthese independent decisions and you are\nthese independent decisions and you are seeing this graph type of data\nseeing this graph type of data\nseeing this graph type of data structure. Okay. So you have a graph\nstructure. Okay. So you have a graph\nstructure. Okay. So you have a graph where you can have like this kind of you\nwhere you can have like this kind of you\nwhere you can have like this kind of you know like like cycles and so on and it\nknow like like cycles and so on and it\nknow like like cycles and so on and it is represented as stateful workflows\nis represented as stateful workflows\nis represented as stateful workflows which is a graph. Okay. So for this\nwhich is a graph. Okay. So for this\nwhich is a graph. Okay. So for this scenario you will use lang graph. So\nscenario you will use lang graph. So\nscenario you will use lang graph. So let's outline the differences in a table\nlet's outline the differences in a table\nlet's outline the differences in a table format. You use lang chain to build llm\nformat. You use lang chain to build llm\nformat. You use lang chain to build llm apps. Okay chains tools and agents.\napps. Okay chains tools and agents.\napps. Okay chains tools and agents. Whereas langraph is used to manage\nWhereas langraph is used to manage\nWhereas langraph is used to manage complex workflows with state. Okay. So\ncomplex workflows with state. Okay. So\ncomplex workflows with state. Okay. So it will have a state and that state will\nit will have a state and that state will\nit will have a state and that state will pass through different nodes in the\npass through different nodes in the\npass through different nodes in the graph. In lang chain you have linear and\ngraph. In lang chain you have linear and\ngraph. In lang chain you have linear and reactive chains. Whereas in lang graph\nreactive chains. Whereas in lang graph\nreactive chains. Whereas in lang graph you have graph based support loops,\nyou have graph based support loops,\nyou have graph based support loops, retries and memories. Okay. So there is\nretries and memories. Okay. So there is\nretries and memories. Okay. So there is some kind of autonomy. When you're\nsome kind of autonomy. When you're\nsome kind of autonomy. When you're retrying let's say you are doing\nretrying let's say you are doing\nretrying let's say you are doing something it doesn't work it will retry\nsomething it doesn't work it will retry\nsomething it doesn't work it will retry again. It's like debugging your code.\nagain. It's like debugging your code.\nagain. It's like debugging your code. You write code you get an error you see\nYou write code you get an error you see\nYou write code you get an error you see the error you update it. You again run\nthe error you update it. You again run\nthe error you update it. You again run it. you know it's like a retry like\nit. you know it's like a retry like\nit. you know it's like a retry like you're fixing and there's a feedback\nyou're fixing and there's a feedback\nyou're fixing and there's a feedback loop. So you'll see all of that in this\nloop. So you'll see all of that in this\nloop. So you'll see all of that in this lang graph and the best use case for\nlang graph and the best use case for\nlang graph and the best use case for lang chain is simple chatboards rack\nlang chain is simple chatboards rack\nlang chain is simple chatboards rack tool usage whereas for complex workflows\ntool usage whereas for complex workflows\ntool usage whereas for complex workflows you know in our HR assistant chatboard\nyou know in our HR assistant chatboard\nyou know in our HR assistant chatboard when we said onboard new employee for\nwhen we said onboard new employee for\nwhen we said onboard new employee for this that kind of workflow which is\nthis that kind of workflow which is\nthis that kind of workflow which is multi-step agent with memory you will\nmulti-step agent with memory you will\nmulti-step agent with memory you will use langraph okay uh here the state\nuse langraph okay uh here the state\nuse langraph okay uh here the state handling is partially stateful or\nhandling is partially stateful or\nhandling is partially stateful or stateless in lang chain whereas in lang\nstateless in lang chain whereas in lang\nstateless in lang chain whereas in lang graph\ngraph\ngraph it is fully stateful. So there is a\nit is fully stateful. So there is a\nit is fully stateful. So there is a state that you will pass. Okay. So let's\nstate that you will pass. Okay. So let's\nstate that you will pass. Okay. So let's say in in\nsay in in\nsay in in lang graph you will have this kind of\nlang graph you will have this kind of\nlang graph you will have this kind of graph right. So you begin you have this\ngraph right. So you begin you have this\ngraph right. So you begin you have this kind of graph. This can have nodes.\nkind of graph. This can have nodes.\nkind of graph. This can have nodes. Okay. It can be any graph and you will\nOkay. It can be any graph and you will\nOkay. It can be any graph and you will be passing a state. So there will be a\nbe passing a state. So there will be a\nbe passing a state. So there will be a state. So there is some kind of state\nstate. So there is some kind of state\nstate. So there is some kind of state that you pass. So you pass it here. same\nthat you pass. So you pass it here. same\nthat you pass. So you pass it here. same state is being passed here. We will uh\nstate is being passed here. We will uh\nstate is being passed here. We will uh have a separate section on this so you\nhave a separate section on this so you\nhave a separate section on this so you will understand and each of these nodes\nwill understand and each of these nodes\nwill understand and each of these nodes will\nwill\nwill modify this state. Okay. And then\nmodify this state. Okay. And then\nmodify this state. Okay. And then example use case for lang is book a\nexample use case for lang is book a\nexample use case for lang is book a flight simple API whereas langraph you\nflight simple API whereas langraph you\nflight simple API whereas langraph you use it for complex thing like plan a\nuse it for complex thing like plan a\nuse it for complex thing like plan a vacation multiple step multi-step\nvacation multiple step multi-step\nvacation multiple step multi-step reasoning planning and so on.

So you can enhance this. you know you can add\nenhance this. you know you can add\nenhance this. you know you can add whatever extra files here. So this is\nwhatever extra files here. So this is\nwhatever extra files here. So this is the project structure that it has\nthe project structure that it has\nthe project structure that it has created and PyCharm is asking me to\ncreated and PyCharm is asking me to\ncreated and PyCharm is asking me to select a valid Python interpreter. So\nselect a valid Python interpreter. So\nselect a valid Python interpreter. So what I'm going to do is I will create\nwhat I'm going to do is I will create\nwhat I'm going to do is I will create virtual environment using UV and the way\nvirtual environment using UV and the way\nvirtual environment using UV and the way you do that is you will install\nyou do that is you will install\nyou do that is you will install necessary Python uh packages. So for now\nnecessary Python uh packages. So for now\nnecessary Python uh packages. So for now what I need is langraph. So you can just\nwhat I need is langraph. So you can just\nwhat I need is langraph. So you can just say uv add in that directory lang graph\nsay uv add in that directory lang graph\nsay uv add in that directory lang graph I also need python dot environment I\nI also need python dot environment I\nI also need python dot environment I need notebook. So just add and you'll\nneed notebook. So just add and you'll\nneed notebook. So just add and you'll see it's so fast it created virtual\nsee it's so fast it created virtual\nsee it's so fast it created virtual environment\nenvironment\nenvironment here. See v environment and it also\nhere. See v environment and it also\nhere. See v environment and it also added all the dependencies. So you will\nadded all the dependencies. So you will\nadded all the dependencies. So you will see this toml file being updated. See\nsee this toml file being updated. See\nsee this toml file being updated. See all the dependencies are added and the\nall the dependencies are added and the\nall the dependencies are added and the exit dependencies are expanded in this\nexit dependencies are expanded in this\nexit dependencies are expanded in this uv.log file. Okay. So these are internal\nuv.log file. Okay. So these are internal\nuv.log file. Okay. So these are internal details. You don't need to worry. You\ndetails. You don't need to worry. You\ndetails. You don't need to worry. You can treat it as a black box. Whatever\ncan treat it as a black box. Whatever\ncan treat it as a black box. Whatever you want to install.

Now with uv you are saying uv add that\nNow with uv you are saying uv add that\nNow with uv you are saying uv add that particular thing. Now let me configure\nparticular thing. Now let me configure\nparticular thing. Now let me configure python interpreter. So click on\npython interpreter. So click on\npython interpreter. So click on configure python interpreter. uh go to\nconfigure python interpreter. uh go to\nconfigure python interpreter. uh go to interpreter settings\ninterpreter settings\ninterpreter settings and here just say add interpreter add\nand here just say add interpreter add\nand here just say add interpreter add local interpreter. Okay, select existing\nlocal interpreter. Okay, select existing\nlocal interpreter. Okay, select existing and click on this folder icon. Okay,\nand click on this folder icon. Okay,\nand click on this folder icon. Okay, folder icon and here you need to select\nfolder icon and here you need to select\nfolder icon and here you need to select the virtual environment. So we have\nthe virtual environment. So we have\nthe virtual environment. So we have langraph learning okay which has venv\nlangraph learning okay which has venv\nlangraph learning okay which has venv folder that's your virtual environment.\nfolder that's your virtual environment.\nfolder that's your virtual environment. Go to scripts and in scripts you need to\nGo to scripts and in scripts you need to\nGo to scripts and in scripts you need to pick up a python.exe.\npick up a python.exe.\npick up a python.exe. Okay. Make sure you're selecting the\nOkay. Make sure you're selecting the\nOkay. Make sure you're selecting the Python interpreter within the virtual\nPython interpreter within the virtual\nPython interpreter within the virtual environment which is created by UV. So\nenvironment which is created by UV. So\nenvironment which is created by UV. So once you hit okay\nall right now your environment is all\nall right now your environment is all set. Graph is a most fundamental data\nset. Graph is a most fundamental data\nset. Graph is a most fundamental data structure in langraph. So let's\nstructure in langraph. So let's\nstructure in langraph. So let's understand some of the basics. If you\nunderstand some of the basics. If you\nunderstand some of the basics. If you have taken computer science classes, you\nhave taken computer science classes, you\nhave taken computer science classes, you will know graph uh already. So graph is\nwill know graph uh already. So graph is\nwill know graph uh already. So graph is nothing but nodes and ages. So let's say\nnothing but nodes and ages. So let's say\nnothing but nodes and ages. So let's say you have Google map, right? Like and you\nyou have Google map, right? Like and you\nyou have Google map, right? Like and you have all these cities. Let's say you\nhave all these cities. Let's say you\nhave all these cities. Let's say you have Delhi, New York, Mumbai, etc. So\nhave Delhi, New York, Mumbai, etc. So\nhave Delhi, New York, Mumbai, etc. So these cities are sort of like nodes.\nthese cities are sort of like nodes.\nthese cities are sort of like nodes. Okay? So whatever round you are seeing,\nOkay? So whatever round you are seeing,\nOkay? So whatever round you are seeing, they are nodes. And the thing that\nthey are nodes. And the thing that\nthey are nodes. And the thing that connects these two nodes are called\nconnects these two nodes are called\nconnects these two nodes are called ages.\nages.\nages. Okay. So going back to our example of\nOkay. So going back to our example of\nOkay. So going back to our example of Google map. Let's say this is Delhi.\nGoogle map. Let's say this is Delhi.\nGoogle map. Let's say this is Delhi. Okay. And from Delhi I'm going to\nOkay. And from Delhi I'm going to\nOkay. And from Delhi I'm going to Mumbai. Just think about this as a road\nMumbai. Just think about this as a road\nMumbai. Just think about this as a road between Delhi and Mumbai. You know some\nbetween Delhi and Mumbai. You know some\nbetween Delhi and Mumbai. You know some expressway.\nexpressway.\nexpressway. Graphs can also have cycles you know and\nGraphs can also have cycles you know and\nGraphs can also have cycles you know and graphs are used to represent things like\ngraphs are used to represent things like\ngraphs are used to represent things like your Facebook connections. So in in your\nyour Facebook connections. So in in your\nyour Facebook connections. So in in your Facebook uh when you have friends so you\nFacebook uh when you have friends so you\nFacebook uh when you have friends so you your friend they are all nodes and your\nyour friend they are all nodes and your\nyour friend they are all nodes and your relationship let's say you're a friend\nrelationship let's say you're a friend\nrelationship let's say you're a friend family whatever you know same way with\nfamily whatever you know same way with\nfamily whatever you know same way with LinkedIn those things are ages so we\nLinkedIn those things are ages so we\nLinkedIn those things are ages so we will build our first simple graph in a\nwill build our first simple graph in a\nwill build our first simple graph in a lang graph and for that we are going to\nlang graph and for that we are going to\nlang graph and for that we are going to use an example of uh let's say your\nuse an example of uh let's say your\nuse an example of uh let's say your stock trading account let's say you have\nstock trading account let's say you have\nstock trading account let's say you have stock trading account in Robin Hood or\nstock trading account in Robin Hood or\nstock trading account in Robin Hood or zeroda you put money in let's say you\nzeroda you put money in let's say you\nzeroda you put money in let's say you are investing in corporate bonds and you\nare investing in corporate bonds and you\nare investing in corporate bonds and you get almost similar kind of fixed uh\nget almost similar kind of fixed uh\nget almost similar kind of fixed uh return let's say around 8%. Okay. Now I\nreturn let's say around 8%. Okay. Now I\nreturn let's say around 8%. Okay. Now I live in US. I invest money and sometimes\nlive in US. I invest money and sometimes\nlive in US. I invest money and sometimes you know I'm from India. So I have this\nyou know I'm from India. So I have this\nyou know I'm from India. So I have this mindset of looking at my portfolio in\nmindset of looking at my portfolio in\nmindset of looking at my portfolio in INR Indian rupees. So what I do is I\nINR Indian rupees. So what I do is I\nINR Indian rupees. So what I do is I invest money and then I get the return\ninvest money and then I get the return\ninvest money and then I get the return and then I calculate the total amount\nand then I calculate the total amount\nand then I calculate the total amount and then I convert it to INR. Okay. So\nand then I convert it to INR. Okay. So\nand then I convert it to INR. Okay. So if you think about that uh in terms of a\nif you think about that uh in terms of a\nif you think about that uh in terms of a graph what you have is you have your\ngraph what you have is you have your\ngraph what you have is you have your input amount. Okay. Let's say you have\ninput amount. Okay. Let's say you have\ninput amount. Okay. Let's say you have input amount in zerod. Let's say you put\ninput amount in zerod. Let's say you put\ninput amount in zerod. Let's say you put or let's say bank account you put some\nor let's say bank account you put some\nor let's say bank account you put some $1,000 and you have your first node\n$1,000 and you have your first node\n$1,000 and you have your first node which will calculate your total amount\nwhich will calculate your total amount\nwhich will calculate your total amount including interest. So let's say you are\nincluding interest. So let's say you are\nincluding interest. So let's say you are getting interest or let's say bond is\ngetting interest or let's say bond is\ngetting interest or let's say bond is giving you 8% return. Okay. So here this\ngiving you 8% return. Okay. So here this\ngiving you 8% return. Okay. So here this is your first node and after you get 8%\nis your first node and after you get 8%\nis your first node and after you get 8% return your total okay your total in USD\nreturn your total okay your total in USD\nreturn your total okay your total in USD is going to be 1,000 into 8%. So 8% is\nis going to be 1,000 into 8%. So 8% is\nis going to be 1,000 into 8%. So 8% is like so if you do this you will get the\nlike so if you do this you will get the\nlike so if you do this you will get the total amount okay and then in node two I\ntotal amount okay and then in node two I\ntotal amount okay and then in node two I would like to convert this amount into\nwould like to convert this amount into\nwould like to convert this amount into INR. Okay. So this one the first node\nINR. Okay. So this one the first node\nINR. Okay. So this one the first node let's say if you have to write python\nlet's say if you have to write python\nlet's say if you have to write python function we can say calc total this will\nfunction we can say calc total this will\nfunction we can say calc total this will be my function and the second function\nbe my function and the second function\nbe my function and the second function will be convert\nwill be convert\nwill be convert to INR\nto INR\nto INR and when you do that like your total INR\nand when you do that like your total INR\nand when you do that like your total INR will be whatever is your total USD\nwill be whatever is your total USD\nwill be whatever is your total USD amount multiplied by the exchange rate\namount multiplied by the exchange rate\namount multiplied by the exchange rate let's say right now it's 85 so this okay\nlet's say right now it's 85 so this okay\nlet's say right now it's 85 so this okay and that's the amount you get uh as an\nand that's the amount you get uh as an\nand that's the amount you get uh as an output. Okay. Now the way lang graph uh\noutput. Okay. Now the way lang graph uh\noutput. Okay. Now the way lang graph uh graphs work is they will consume\ngraphs work is they will consume\ngraphs work is they will consume something called a state. So if you have\nsomething called a state. So if you have\nsomething called a state. So if you have taken some computer science classes uh\ntaken some computer science classes uh\ntaken some computer science classes uh you will know about this state. So state\nyou will know about this state. So state\nyou will know about this state. So state is let's say an object. Okay. So state\nis let's say an object. Okay. So state\nis let's say an object. Okay. So state is an object which gets passed between\nis an object which gets passed between\nis an object which gets passed between the nodes and this state will have all\nthe nodes and this state will have all\nthe nodes and this state will have all these parameters right. So it will have\nthese parameters right. So it will have\nthese parameters right. So it will have amount\namount\namount it will have total USD total\nit will have total USD total\nit will have total USD total USD it will have total INR and so on and\nUSD it will have total INR and so on and\nUSD it will have total INR and so on and you pass this state you know like like\nyou pass this state you know like like\nyou pass this state you know like like it goes through this node and you get\nit goes through this node and you get\nit goes through this node and you get new state again you get new state so\nnew state again you get new state so\nnew state again you get new state so you're not calling these nodes by\nyou're not calling these nodes by\nyou're not calling these nodes by function etc it's just a state whatever\nfunction etc it's just a state whatever\nfunction etc it's just a state whatever you want to pass single object you pass\nyou want to pass single object you pass\nyou want to pass single object you pass it and it just comes out so let me write\nit and it just comes out so let me write\nit and it just comes out so let me write the code folks this is very very simple.\nthe code folks this is very very simple.\nthe code folks this is very very simple. Uh you you will be amazed how simple\nUh you you will be amazed how simple\nUh you you will be amazed how simple this thing is. So let's create a\nthis thing is. So let's create a\nthis thing is. So let's create a notebook. Now uh this PyCharm version\nnotebook. Now uh this PyCharm version\nnotebook. Now uh this PyCharm version allows you to write notebooks\nallows you to write notebooks\nallows you to write notebooks uh inside the ID. Okay? So you don't\nuh inside the ID. Okay? So you don't\nuh inside the ID. Okay? So you don't have to go outside. And I will just call\nhave to go outside. And I will just call\nhave to go outside. And I will just call it simple graph.\nit simple graph.\nit simple graph. Now what I love about uh this is it will\nNow what I love about uh this is it will\nNow what I love about uh this is it will give you AI autocomplete. Okay. So first\ngive you AI autocomplete. Okay. So first\ngive you AI autocomplete. Okay. So first thing that we are going to do is we will\nthing that we are going to do is we will\nthing that we are going to do is we will define our state. Okay. So this state\ndefine our state. Okay. So this state\ndefine our state. Okay. So this state this red square is an object a python\nthis red square is an object a python\nthis red square is an object a python dictionary or let's say class. Okay. So\ndictionary or let's say class. Okay. So\ndictionary or let's say class. Okay. So let's define that. So I will say class\nlet's define that. So I will say class\nlet's define that. So I will say class portfolio\nportfolio\nportfolio state.\nstate.\nstate. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And\nAnd\nAnd now I want this to be derived from type\nnow I want this to be derived from type\nnow I want this to be derived from type dict. So in Python\ndict. So in Python\ndict. So in Python you you know about this uh thing typing\nyou you know about this uh thing typing\nyou you know about this uh thing typing right? So this way you create type\nright? So this way you create type\nright? So this way you create type hints. You know Python is not a\nhints. You know Python is not a\nhints. You know Python is not a statically typed language but you can\nstatically typed language but you can\nstatically typed language but you can use this typing hints to define data\nuse this typing hints to define data\nuse this typing hints to define data types of your members. So here once you\ntypes of your members. So here once you\ntypes of your members. So here once you derive this from type dict you'll be\nderive this from type dict you'll be\nderive this from type dict you'll be able to define the types. Okay. So here\nable to define the types. Okay. So here\nable to define the types. Okay. So here I will have\nI will have\nI will have amount USD which will be float. Now see\namount USD which will be float. Now see\namount USD which will be float. Now see this is what I like about AI editor like\nthis is what I like about AI editor like\nthis is what I like about AI editor like when you're typing something it will try\nwhen you're typing something it will try\nwhen you're typing something it will try to autocomplete and then you will have\nto autocomplete and then you will have\nto autocomplete and then you will have total\ntotal\ntotal USD which is float. See I'm just hitting\nUSD which is float. See I'm just hitting\nUSD which is float. See I'm just hitting tab and then you have total INR\ntab and then you have total INR\ntab and then you have total INR and that is also float. So control enter\nand that is also float. So control enter\nand that is also float. So control enter or just hit this button. See it is\nor just hit this button. See it is\nor just hit this button. See it is running this. And then the next one will\nrunning this. And then the next one will\nrunning this. And then the next one will be I will just create an object just to\nbe I will just create an object just to\nbe I will just create an object just to kind of show you right. So my object\nkind of show you right. So my object\nkind of show you right. So my object um and how do you define the types in\num and how do you define the types in\num and how do you define the types in Python? Well once again Python is a\nPython? Well once again Python is a\nPython? Well once again Python is a dynamically typed language. So when you\ndynamically typed language. So when you\ndynamically typed language. So when you say colon this you are defining a type\nsay colon this you are defining a type\nsay colon this you are defining a type hint not the exact type. And here you\nhint not the exact type. And here you\nhint not the exact type. And here you can have\ncan have\ncan have amount USD\namount USD\namount USD whatever\nwhatever\nwhatever and then you have total USD\nand then you have total USD\nand then you have total USD and then you have total INR. Okay. Now\nand then you have total INR. Okay. Now\nand then you have total INR. Okay. Now when you do this it works okay but let's\nwhen you do this it works okay but let's\nwhen you do this it works okay but let's say if I have improper key see you will\nsay if I have improper key see you will\nsay if I have improper key see you will see this kind of type hint. See this\nsee this kind of type hint. See this\nsee this kind of type hint. See this bulb. So it is saying that there are\nbulb. So it is saying that there are\nbulb. So it is saying that there are incorrect types. Okay. Okay, so that's\nincorrect types. Okay. Okay, so that's\nincorrect types. Okay. Okay, so that's the whole idea of doing this type dict.\nthe whole idea of doing this type dict.\nthe whole idea of doing this type dict. All right, my state object which is this\nAll right, my state object which is this\nAll right, my state object which is this red object is defined. Now I need to\nred object is defined. Now I need to\nred object is defined. Now I need to define these two nodes which is nothing\ndefine these two nodes which is nothing\ndefine these two nodes which is nothing but a simple Python function that state\nbut a simple Python function that state\nbut a simple Python function that state as an input. Okay, so you will have calc\nas an input. Okay, so you will have calc\nas an input. Okay, so you will have calc total. It will take portfolio state as\ntotal. It will take portfolio state as\ntotal. It will take portfolio state as an input and it will output the\nan input and it will output the\nan input and it will output the portfolio state. Okay. So, portfolio\nportfolio state. Okay. So, portfolio\nportfolio state. Okay. So, portfolio state will be my output.\nstate will be my output.\nstate will be my output. And here what you are getting is uh\nAnd here what you are getting is uh\nAnd here what you are getting is uh let's say I want to call this object\nlet's say I want to call this object\nlet's say I want to call this object state.\nstate.\nstate. In the state the total USD amount that I\nIn the state the total USD amount that I\nIn the state the total USD amount that I have is nothing but the amount in\nhave is nothing but the amount in\nhave is nothing but the amount in USD multiply by the return rates. Let's\nUSD multiply by the return rates. Let's\nUSD multiply by the return rates. Let's say I'm getting 8% fixed return. Okay.\nsay I'm getting 8% fixed return. Okay.\nsay I'm getting 8% fixed return. Okay. And I will just return this state back.\nAnd I will just return this state back.\nAnd I will just return this state back. Okay. So you're getting state as an\nOkay. So you're getting state as an\nOkay. So you're getting state as an input. You are returning state as an\ninput. You are returning state as an\ninput. You are returning state as an output as per this diagram. This red\noutput as per this diagram. This red\noutput as per this diagram. This red square will pass between the nodes. So\nsquare will pass between the nodes. So\nsquare will pass between the nodes. So say same thing for the second function\nsay same thing for the second function\nsay same thing for the second function which is convert to INR. So I'll just\nwhich is convert to INR. So I'll just\nwhich is convert to INR. So I'll just copy paste folks just to save time on\ncopy paste folks just to save time on\ncopy paste folks just to save time on recording. Pretty straightforward. you\nrecording. Pretty straightforward. you\nrecording. Pretty straightforward. you are getting state as an input, state as\nare getting state as an input, state as\nare getting state as an input, state as an output and this is how you define the\nan output and this is how you define the\nan output and this is how you define the data type of output using the Python\ndata type of output using the Python\ndata type of output using the Python type hints. Okay? And in this function\ntype hints. Okay? And in this function\ntype hints. Okay? And in this function what you're doing is you're saying total\nwhat you're doing is you're saying total\nwhat you're doing is you're saying total INR is nothing but whatever is the total\nINR is nothing but whatever is the total\nINR is nothing but whatever is the total amount in USD multiplied by 85. Now in\namount in USD multiplied by 85. Now in\namount in USD multiplied by 85. Now in real life situation you will get the\nreal life situation you will get the\nreal life situation you will get the live conversion rates using some APIs.\nlive conversion rates using some APIs.\nlive conversion rates using some APIs. Here it's a learning tutorial so we\nHere it's a learning tutorial so we\nHere it's a learning tutorial so we don't need to bother about all of that.\ndon't need to bother about all of that.\ndon't need to bother about all of that. All right. So let's execute this. This\nAll right. So let's execute this. This\nAll right. So let's execute this. This is done. Now I will go ahead and define\nis done. Now I will go ahead and define\nis done. Now I will go ahead and define my graph. So lang graph dot graph\nmy graph. So lang graph dot graph\nmy graph. So lang graph dot graph import state graph. Okay. And my\nimport state graph. Okay. And my\nimport state graph. Okay. And my builder. So there is something called\nbuilder. So there is something called\nbuilder. So there is something called builder which will let you define that\nbuilder which will let you define that\nbuilder which will let you define that graph. Okay. So here the state is your\ngraph. Okay. So here the state is your\ngraph. Okay. So here the state is your portfolio state. So that is what you're\nportfolio state. So that is what you're\nportfolio state. So that is what you're passing it as an input. Okay. And in the\npassing it as an input. Okay. And in the\npassing it as an input. Okay. And in the graph what do you do? Well, you add\ngraph what do you do? Well, you add\ngraph what do you do? Well, you add nodes. Okay, first you add nodes and\nnodes. Okay, first you add nodes and\nnodes. Okay, first you add nodes and then you define the relationship which\nthen you define the relationship which\nthen you define the relationship which is like ages. So I will just add a node\nis like ages. So I will just add a node\nis like ages. So I will just add a node here saying add node and calculate\nhere saying add node and calculate\nhere saying add node and calculate total. Now you can also define the name\ntotal. Now you can also define the name\ntotal. Now you can also define the name of the node. Okay. So my\nof the node. Okay. So my\nof the node. Okay. So my you can also call it calculate total\nyou can also call it calculate total\nyou can also call it calculate total node, right? calc total and then same\nnode, right? calc total and then same\nnode, right? calc total and then same way you will say\nway you will say\nway you will say uh this one is convert to INR and this\nuh this one is convert to INR and this\nuh this one is convert to INR and this is convert to INR node. Okay. So these\nis convert to INR node. Okay. So these\nis convert to INR node. Okay. So these are the two nodes you have added. Now\nare the two nodes you have added. Now\nare the two nodes you have added. Now you need to add ages to define the\nyou need to add ages to define the\nyou need to add ages to define the relationship. Okay. So it will always\nrelationship. Okay. So it will always\nrelationship. Okay. So it will always start with uh something called a start\nstart with uh something called a start\nstart with uh something called a start age. Okay. So here you you will begin\nage. Okay. So here you you will begin\nage. Okay. So here you you will begin with this start age. So you are starting\nwith this start age. So you are starting\nwith this start age. So you are starting with a start age and then you will end\nwith a start age and then you will end\nwith a start age and then you will end with the end age.\nwith the end age.\nwith the end age. So let's start with that builder dot add\nSo let's start with that builder dot add\nSo let's start with that builder dot add age\nage\nage and in add age\nand in add age\nand in add age you will have start. So start is a\nyou will have start. So start is a\nyou will have start. So start is a constant that you can import from this.\nconstant that you can import from this.\nconstant that you can import from this. So from start first I want to calculate\nSo from start first I want to calculate\nSo from start first I want to calculate the total correct and then from total\nthe total correct and then from total\nthe total correct and then from total I want to go to INR and from INR I want\nI want to go to INR and from INR I want\nI want to go to INR and from INR I want to go to N. Now you just notice like my\nto go to N. Now you just notice like my\nto go to N. Now you just notice like my AI autocomplete is completing it. So I'm\nAI autocomplete is completing it. So I'm\nAI autocomplete is completing it. So I'm saving a lot of time when I use this AI\nsaving a lot of time when I use this AI\nsaving a lot of time when I use this AI assistant. I feel like I have got some\nassistant. I feel like I have got some\nassistant. I feel like I have got some iron man kind of superpower. You know my\niron man kind of superpower. You know my\niron man kind of superpower. You know my productivity goes up because I don't\nproductivity goes up because I don't\nproductivity goes up because I don't have to type so many things. You can\nhave to type so many things. You can\nhave to type so many things. You can also use this AI assistant code here and\nalso use this AI assistant code here and\nalso use this AI assistant code here and you can just say whatever you want to\nyou can just say whatever you want to\nyou can just say whatever you want to do, right? Like you can just say okay\ndo, right? Like you can just say okay\ndo, right? Like you can just say okay complete\ncomplete\ncomplete the code for builder\nthe code for builder\nthe code for builder and display the graph using\nand display the graph using\nand display the graph using I display. So when you do that it is\nI display. So when you do that it is\nI display. So when you do that it is generating the code. See\ngenerating the code. See\ngenerating the code. See you see. So that way it is useful. So\nyou see. So that way it is useful. So\nyou see. So that way it is useful. So I'll just delete it um just to kind of\nI'll just delete it um just to kind of\nI'll just delete it um just to kind of show you manually before I show you how\nshow you manually before I show you how\nshow you manually before I show you how to display the graph. We need to build\nto display the graph. We need to build\nto display the graph. We need to build it. So we'll just say graph is equal to\nit. So we'll just say graph is equal to\nit. So we'll just say graph is equal to builder dot compile.\nbuilder dot compile.\nbuilder dot compile. And this is the code.\nAnd this is the code.\nAnd this is the code. You just copy paste. You don't need to\nYou just copy paste. You don't need to\nYou just copy paste. You don't need to remember syntax etc. to display the\nremember syntax etc. to display the\nremember syntax etc. to display the graph. So as you can see here it has a\ngraph. So as you can see here it has a\ngraph. So as you can see here it has a start node. Then there is calc total\nstart node. Then there is calc total\nstart node. Then there is calc total node convert to INR node and end. Now\nnode convert to INR node and end. Now\nnode convert to INR node and end. Now you can simply call it by doing this.\nyou can simply call it by doing this.\nyou can simply call it by doing this. You can just say graph dot invoke and\nYou can just say graph dot invoke and\nYou can just say graph dot invoke and pass your initial state. Okay. So see on\npass your initial state. Okay. So see on\npass your initial state. Okay. So see on a $1,000 USD amount uh the total USD is\na $1,000 USD amount uh the total USD is\na $1,000 USD amount uh the total USD is 1080 and total INR is this much. Now\n1080 and total INR is this much. Now\n1080 and total INR is this much. Now when you look at this graph it looks\nwhen you look at this graph it looks\nwhen you look at this graph it looks more like a linear chain. In the next\nmore like a linear chain. In the next\nmore like a linear chain. In the next step, we are going to create a graph\nstep, we are going to create a graph\nstep, we are going to create a graph with some conditions. We will design\nwith some conditions. We will design\nwith some conditions. We will design this kind of graph where you give your\nthis kind of graph where you give your\nthis kind of graph where you give your amount as an input and also target\namount as an input and also target\namount as an input and also target currency. So previously we had INR as a\ncurrency. So previously we had INR as a\ncurrency. So previously we had INR as a fixed currency. Now I want to supply\nfixed currency. Now I want to supply\nfixed currency. Now I want to supply INR, EUR etc. And based on the target\nINR, EUR etc. And based on the target\nINR, EUR etc. And based on the target currency, it will call different nodes.\ncurrency, it will call different nodes.\ncurrency, it will call different nodes. Okay. So let's create a Jupyter notebook\nOkay. So let's create a Jupyter notebook\nOkay. So let's create a Jupyter notebook here.\nhere.\nhere. This will be to graph with condition.\nThis will be to graph with condition.\nThis will be to graph with condition. And here I'm going to do some copy\nAnd here I'm going to do some copy\nAnd here I'm going to do some copy paste.\npaste.\npaste. Now I don't want this to be total INR.\nNow I don't want this to be total INR.\nNow I don't want this to be total INR. It is total INR. And you will have a\nIt is total INR. And you will have a\nIt is total INR. And you will have a target currency. Okay. So from by the\ntarget currency. Okay. So from by the\ntarget currency. Okay. So from by the way if you want to support fixed set of\nway if you want to support fixed set of\nway if you want to support fixed set of currency you can use literal which will\ncurrency you can use literal which will\ncurrency you can use literal which will means like just use from these\nmeans like just use from these\nmeans like just use from these currencies. Okay. So let's say I want\ncurrencies. Okay. So let's say I want\ncurrencies. Okay. So let's say I want only INR and EUR to be my target\nonly INR and EUR to be my target\nonly INR and EUR to be my target currency. Okay. So let's execute this\ncurrency. Okay. So let's execute this\ncurrency. Okay. So let's execute this and also copy paste this here.\nand also copy paste this here.\nand also copy paste this here. So I have\nSo I have\nSo I have total USD. I think this function is okay\ntotal USD. I think this function is okay\ntotal USD. I think this function is okay but total INR should be this because we\nbut total INR should be this because we\nbut total INR should be this because we don't have that total INR variable\ndon't have that total INR variable\ndon't have that total INR variable and let's create a convert to EUR\nand let's create a convert to EUR\nand let's create a convert to EUR function. Okay, so convert to EUR\nfunction. Okay, so convert to EUR\nfunction. Okay, so convert to EUR will be whatever is the I'm just hard\nwill be whatever is the I'm just hard\nwill be whatever is the I'm just hard coding 0.9. Whatever is the rate you can\ncoding 0.9. Whatever is the rate you can\ncoding 0.9. Whatever is the rate you can put it there. Okay, so let's execute. So\nput it there. Okay, so let's execute. So\nput it there. Okay, so let's execute. So we have this three nodes now. So let's\nwe have this three nodes now. So let's\nwe have this three nodes now. So let's add those three nodes. Okay. So here\nadd those three nodes. Okay. So here\nadd those three nodes. Okay. So here I will once again copy paste this\nI will once again copy paste this\nI will once again copy paste this calc total node convert to INR node and\ncalc total node convert to INR node and\ncalc total node convert to INR node and convert to EUR node. Okay. So this is\nconvert to EUR node. Okay. So this is\nconvert to EUR node. Okay. So this is convert to EUR\nconvert to EUR\nconvert to EUR EUR. Now let's think about ages. So the\nEUR. Now let's think about ages. So the\nEUR. Now let's think about ages. So the first age is this which is okay. You\nfirst age is this which is okay. You\nfirst age is this which is okay. You always calculate total and then you add\nalways calculate total and then you add\nalways calculate total and then you add something called a conditional age.\nsomething called a conditional age.\nsomething called a conditional age. So in conditional age your start key or\nSo in conditional age your start key or\nSo in conditional age your start key or your source is let's say this one right\nyour source is let's say this one right\nyour source is let's say this one right kelp total node\nkelp total node\nkelp total node and then you want to write a function\nand then you want to write a function\nand then you want to write a function that will help you select you know which\nthat will help you select you know which\nthat will help you select you know which node to go to. So we can say choose\nnode to go to. So we can say choose\nnode to go to. So we can say choose conversion is our function. it will get\nconversion is our function. it will get\nconversion is our function. it will get state as an input obviously\nstate as an input obviously\nstate as an input obviously portfolio state and I want the string to\nportfolio state and I want the string to\nportfolio state and I want the string to be the output. It will return a string\nbe the output. It will return a string\nbe the output. It will return a string and and see you can do simply you can\nand and see you can do simply you can\nand and see you can do simply you can just return the target currency folks.\njust return the target currency folks.\njust return the target currency folks. So based on whatever is the target\nSo based on whatever is the target\nSo based on whatever is the target currency you can make a decision. So let\ncurrency you can make a decision. So let\ncurrency you can make a decision. So let me show you. So once you do that you\nme show you. So once you do that you\nme show you. So once you do that you supply this as a second argument here.\nsupply this as a second argument here.\nsupply this as a second argument here. Okay. So first argument is the starting\nOkay. So first argument is the starting\nOkay. So first argument is the starting node. Second one is the function. So\nnode. Second one is the function. So\nnode. Second one is the function. So calculate node calculated a state and\ncalculate node calculated a state and\ncalculate node calculated a state and state was passed to conversion and what\nstate was passed to conversion and what\nstate was passed to conversion and what you got as an output is a string\nyou got as an output is a string\nyou got as an output is a string actually. Okay. So here\nactually. Okay. So here\nactually. Okay. So here you can do something like\nyou can do something like\nyou can do something like say hello this autocomplete. So the\nsay hello this autocomplete. So the\nsay hello this autocomplete. So the output can be either INR or EUR and you\noutput can be either INR or EUR and you\noutput can be either INR or EUR and you want to map INR to convert to INR node\nwant to map INR to convert to INR node\nwant to map INR to convert to INR node and convert to UR node. So you're just\nand convert to UR node. So you're just\nand convert to UR node. So you're just doing the mapping. Okay. So that's your\ndoing the mapping. Okay. So that's your\ndoing the mapping. Okay. So that's your conditional age. And your last age\nconditional age. And your last age\nconditional age. And your last age is\nis\nis you can do this. You can do either this\nyou can do this. You can do either this\nyou can do this. You can do either this or you can supply this as an array.\nor you can supply this as an array.\nor you can supply this as an array. Either way works fine. Okay. So\nEither way works fine. Okay. So\nEither way works fine. Okay. So applying this as an array\napplying this as an array\napplying this as an array and then graph is equal to builder dot\nand then graph is equal to builder dot\nand then graph is equal to builder dot compile. I run it\ncompile. I run it\ncompile. I run it and then okay I got this error because\nand then okay I got this error because\nand then okay I got this error because this function was not defined.\nthis function was not defined.\nthis function was not defined. Okay, it ran fine\nOkay, it ran fine\nOkay, it ran fine and let's run the graph. See you see\nand let's run the graph. See you see\nand let's run the graph. See you see like now you see\nlike now you see\nlike now you see from calculate node it will use this\nfrom calculate node it will use this\nfrom calculate node it will use this function which will return which\nfunction which will return which\nfunction which will return which function choose conversion remember\nfunction choose conversion remember\nfunction choose conversion remember choose conversion will return either UR\nchoose conversion will return either UR\nchoose conversion will return either UR or INR and based on that it will pick\nor INR and based on that it will pick\nor INR and based on that it will pick this function\nthis function\nthis function all right now let's run this so you will\nall right now let's run this so you will\nall right now let's run this so you will just say graph\njust say graph\njust say graph dot invoke\ndot invoke\ndot invoke and see for INR currency See it is\nand see for INR currency See it is\nand see for INR currency See it is returning this. I mean you can do the\nreturning this. I mean you can do the\nreturning this. I mean you can do the math it's correct. Or if you do eur it\nmath it's correct. Or if you do eur it\nmath it's correct. Or if you do eur it is going through a different path of\nis going through a different path of\nis going through a different path of invocation. So congratulation we just\ninvocation. So congratulation we just\ninvocation. So congratulation we just created a graph with some conditions and\ncreated a graph with some conditions and\ncreated a graph with some conditions and some kind of routing. Let us now create\nsome kind of routing. Let us now create\nsome kind of routing. Let us now create a simple chatboard state graph. Here we\na simple chatboard state graph. Here we\na simple chatboard state graph. Here we will be using Google Gemini model. You\nwill be using Google Gemini model. You\nwill be using Google Gemini model. You can use openAI or other model too. You\ncan use openAI or other model too. You\ncan use openAI or other model too. You need to create API key first. So just\nneed to create API key first. So just\nneed to create API key first. So just Google Gemini API key and click on this\nGoogle Gemini API key and click on this\nGoogle Gemini API key and click on this link and click on get API key or let's\nlink and click on get API key or let's\nlink and click on get API key or let's say create API key and here it will ask\nsay create API key and here it will ask\nsay create API key and here it will ask you for the Google project. So you can u\nyou for the Google project. So you can u\nyou for the Google project. So you can u once again Google Google cloud project\nonce again Google Google cloud project\nonce again Google Google cloud project and here you'll be logging using your\nand here you'll be logging using your\nand here you'll be logging using your Gmail ID obviously and if you click here\nGmail ID obviously and if you click here\nGmail ID obviously and if you click here you will see all your projects. So just\nyou will see all your projects. So just\nyou will see all your projects. So just create a new project. Okay, I have\ncreate a new project. Okay, I have\ncreate a new project. Okay, I have already created all these projects. So,\nalready created all these projects. So,\nalready created all these projects. So, I'm going to select AI agents tutorial.\nI'm going to select AI agents tutorial.\nI'm going to select AI agents tutorial. So, AI agents tutorial and create an API\nSo, AI agents tutorial and create an API\nSo, AI agents tutorial and create an API key. Once that API key is copied to a\nkey. Once that API key is copied to a\nkey. Once that API key is copied to a secure place, what you will do is you\nsecure place, what you will do is you\nsecure place, what you will do is you will create this file called env. Okay?\nwill create this file called env. Okay?\nwill create this file called env. Okay? So right click file enviable\nGoogle API key and whatever is your key\nGoogle API key and whatever is your key just copy paste that we will now create\njust copy paste that we will now create\njust copy paste that we will now create a new notebook called\na new notebook called\na new notebook called chatbot and we'll load that key into\nchatbot and we'll load that key into\nchatbot and we'll load that key into environment variable okay so from dot\nenvironment variable okay so from dot\nenvironment variable okay so from dot environment this is the module that we\nenvironment this is the module that we\nenvironment this is the module that we use when you do this it will set Google\nuse when you do this it will set Google\nuse when you do this it will set Google Gemini key as an environment\nGemini key as an environment\nGemini key as an environment variable. Okay. So, execute this and\nvariable. Okay. So, execute this and\nvariable. Okay. So, execute this and we'll install some necessary modules\nwe'll install some necessary modules\nwe'll install some necessary modules now. So, just say UV add lang chain.\nnow. So, just say UV add lang chain.\nnow. So, just say UV add lang chain. Lang chain is probably not installed\nLang chain is probably not installed\nLang chain is probably not installed right now. And the other one is lang\nright now. And the other one is lang\nright now. And the other one is lang chain Google geni. This if you're using\nchain Google geni. This if you're using\nchain Google geni. This if you're using openai you have to install a different\nopenai you have to install a different\nopenai you have to install a different module. Okay. Then uh from\nmodule. Okay. Then uh from\nmodule. Okay. Then uh from lang\nlang\nlang chain dot chat models\nchain dot chat models\nchain dot chat models okay import init\nokay import init\nokay import init chat model\nchat model\nchat model okay and then create an llm\nokay and then create an llm\nokay and then create an llm by calling init chat model.\nSo I'll be using Gemini here. And when\nSo I'll be using Gemini here. And when you do llm invoke and say who was the\nyou do llm invoke and say who was the\nyou do llm invoke and say who was the first person to walk on moon, it will it\nfirst person to walk on moon, it will it\nfirst person to walk on moon, it will it will answer that question. Okay. So your\nwill answer that question. Okay. So your\nwill answer that question. Okay. So your basic LLM setup is done and you will see\nbasic LLM setup is done and you will see\nbasic LLM setup is done and you will see that it will have this AI message, human\nthat it will have this AI message, human\nthat it will have this AI message, human message, you know, all those kind of\nmessage, you know, all those kind of\nmessage, you know, all those kind of things. All right. So this thing is set\nthings. All right. So this thing is set\nthings. All right. So this thing is set up. Now let's create our uh state graph.\nup. Now let's create our uh state graph.\nup. Now let's create our uh state graph. Okay, our state graph and our usual\nOkay, our state graph and our usual\nOkay, our state graph and our usual setup. So I'm going to remove this\nsetup. So I'm going to remove this\nsetup. So I'm going to remove this because this is not needed. And here you\nbecause this is not needed. And here you\nbecause this is not needed. And here you will create a state and I will also\nwill create a state and I will also\nwill create a state and I will also import some necessary models here all in\nimport some necessary models here all in\nimport some necessary models here all in one go. Okay. So this is type dict\none go. Okay. So this is type dict\none go. Okay. So this is type dict and my state like what should be the\nand my state like what should be the\nand my state like what should be the state? Well, I'm exchanging messages. So\nstate? Well, I'm exchanging messages. So\nstate? Well, I'm exchanging messages. So it is good if I have a messages list you\nit is good if I have a messages list you\nit is good if I have a messages list you know because there is a conversation to\nknow because there is a conversation to\nknow because there is a conversation to maintain the chat history I will have\nmaintain the chat history I will have\nmaintain the chat history I will have all the messages being appended into\nall the messages being appended into\nall the messages being appended into this messages list. So therefore I'm\nthis messages list. So therefore I'm\nthis messages list. So therefore I'm having this and our node will be\nhaving this and our node will be\nhaving this and our node will be chatboard which takes this particular\nchatboard which takes this particular\nchatboard which takes this particular state as input. It will output the same\nstate as input. It will output the same\nstate as input. It will output the same thing\nthing\nthing and you will say return\nand you will say return\nand you will say return you want to return same thing right like\nyou want to return same thing right like\nyou want to return same thing right like messages and you will say that\nmessages and you will say that\nmessages and you will say that um so see messages is a list okay and\num so see messages is a list okay and\num so see messages is a list okay and you'll say llm dot invoke whatever llm\nyou'll say llm dot invoke whatever llm\nyou'll say llm dot invoke whatever llm you created\nyou created\nyou created this okay I I'll run it and you will get\nthis okay I I'll run it and you will get\nthis okay I I'll run it and you will get more idea on this and then our graph\nmore idea on this and then our graph\nmore idea on this and then our graph compilation is pretty straightforward\ncompilation is pretty straightforward\ncompilation is pretty straightforward you have start node chat port and\nyou have start node chat port and\nyou have start node chat port and compile right so that's pretty\ncompile right so that's pretty\ncompile right so that's pretty straightforward and now I will say graph\nstraightforward and now I will say graph\nstraightforward and now I will say graph dot invoke so this is a common\ndot invoke so this is a common\ndot invoke so this is a common convention that they use where you\nconvention that they use where you\nconvention that they use where you specify role of user and the actual\nspecify role of user and the actual\nspecify role of user and the actual message okay so graph dot invoke\nmessage okay so graph dot invoke\nmessage okay so graph dot invoke it expects messages as a state input\nit expects messages as a state input\nit expects messages as a state input right you need to add her to this schema\nright you need to add her to this schema\nright you need to add her to this schema okay and that messages\nokay and that messages\nokay and that messages is this message\nis this message\nis this message and you will get a response back which\nand you will get a response back which\nand you will get a response back which will be again messages. So response\nwill be again messages. So response\nwill be again messages. So response messages\nmessages\nmessages um you can you can print this and let's\num you can you can print this and let's\num you can you can print this and let's see how this goes. Okay, so I executed\nsee how this goes. Okay, so I executed\nsee how this goes. Okay, so I executed this and it says Neil Armstrong. Okay,\nthis and it says Neil Armstrong. Okay,\nthis and it says Neil Armstrong. Okay, Neil Armstrong. So it worked as expected\nNeil Armstrong. So it worked as expected\nNeil Armstrong. So it worked as expected but I don't see the original question.\nbut I don't see the original question.\nbut I don't see the original question. Usually when you are in chat GPD right\nUsually when you are in chat GPD right\nUsually when you are in chat GPD right you see a question from a human right so\nyou see a question from a human right so\nyou see a question from a human right so there is a human message where we say\nthere is a human message where we say\nthere is a human message where we say okay it will ask okay who was the first\nokay it will ask okay who was the first\nokay it will ask okay who was the first person to walk on the moon then it will\nperson to walk on the moon then it will\nperson to walk on the moon then it will be an AI human that kind of thing okay\nbe an AI human that kind of thing okay\nbe an AI human that kind of thing okay so you somehow want to preserve that\nso you somehow want to preserve that\nso you somehow want to preserve that original question because then if you're\noriginal question because then if you're\noriginal question because then if you're maintaining a chat history it will have\nmaintaining a chat history it will have\nmaintaining a chat history it will have a context so in order to do that we need\na context so in order to do that we need\na context so in order to do that we need to make some changes here. Okay, here we\nto make some changes here. Okay, here we\nto make some changes here. Okay, here we are not just saying list but we are\nare not just saying list but we are\nare not just saying list but we are saying this is annotated list and then\nsaying this is annotated list and then\nsaying this is annotated list and then we will say add messages. So add\nwe will say add messages. So add\nwe will say add messages. So add messages is a built-in function from\nmessages is a built-in function from\nmessages is a built-in function from lang graph what it will do is once you\nlang graph what it will do is once you\nlang graph what it will do is once you specify this kind of uh syntax it will\nspecify this kind of uh syntax it will\nspecify this kind of uh syntax it will automatically preserve the original\nautomatically preserve the original\nautomatically preserve the original message. Okay so let me just run it\nmessage. Okay so let me just run it\nmessage. Okay so let me just run it quickly. Okay here annotated is not\nquickly. Okay here annotated is not\nquickly. Okay here annotated is not defined. Okay, because it is here and I\ndefined. Okay, because it is here and I\ndefined. Okay, because it is here and I did not execute this cell. Okay, so let\ndid not execute this cell. Okay, so let\ndid not execute this cell. Okay, so let me just execute this\nme just execute this\nme just execute this and then this. You need to execute all\nand then this. You need to execute all\nand then this. You need to execute all of this.\nof this.\nof this. Now when you see it, see human message\nNow when you see it, see human message\nNow when you see it, see human message is preserved. So first is human message\nis preserved. So first is human message\nis preserved. So first is human message who walked on the moon for the first\nwho walked on the moon for the first\nwho walked on the moon for the first time and then there is AI message. Okay.\ntime and then there is AI message. Okay.\ntime and then there is AI message. Okay. So this uh function by the way is called\nSo this uh function by the way is called\nSo this uh function by the way is called a reducer function. This particular add\na reducer function. This particular add\na reducer function. This particular add message is called a reducer function. It\nmessage is called a reducer function. It\nmessage is called a reducer function. It will add some kind of validation to\nwill add some kind of validation to\nwill add some kind of validation to messages. It will tell it you know that\nmessages. It will tell it you know that\nmessages. It will tell it you know that it you don't need to override but you\nit you don't need to override but you\nit you don't need to override but you need to append the new messages which is\nneed to append the new messages which is\nneed to append the new messages which is coming from AI. If you want to\ncoming from AI. If you want to\ncoming from AI. If you want to understand that in detail you can just\nunderstand that in detail you can just\nunderstand that in detail you can just Google langraph reducers. Okay, reducers\nGoogle langraph reducers. Okay, reducers\nGoogle langraph reducers. Okay, reducers add message function and you will\nadd message function and you will\nadd message function and you will find some documentation.\nfind some documentation.\nfind some documentation. Okay, so update state all of that. Um,\nOkay, so update state all of that. Um,\nOkay, so update state all of that. Um, so I I went to this particular\nso I I went to this particular\nso I I went to this particular I think where is it? Yeah, here. See, so\nI think where is it? Yeah, here. See, so\nI think where is it? Yeah, here. See, so this is how reducer works. So when you\nthis is how reducer works. So when you\nthis is how reducer works. So when you have this function\nhave this function\nhave this function add messages, right? add messages.\nadd messages, right? add messages.\nadd messages, right? add messages. You can read more about it. They have\nYou can read more about it. They have\nYou can read more about it. They have given nice documentation. All right. So,\ngiven nice documentation. All right. So,\ngiven nice documentation. All right. So, our chatbot is defined. Let's say if you\nour chatbot is defined. Let's say if you\nour chatbot is defined. Let's say if you want to write a loop uh where you can\nwant to write a loop uh where you can\nwant to write a loop uh where you can ask question one by one, then you can\nask question one by one, then you can\nask question one by one, then you can use this particular code. So, let me\nuse this particular code. So, let me\nuse this particular code. So, let me just show it to you. It's just simple\njust show it to you. It's just simple\njust show it to you. It's just simple while loop, okay? Where you initialize\nwhile loop, okay? Where you initialize\nwhile loop, okay? Where you initialize your state to be none. And then in the\nyour state to be none. And then in the\nyour state to be none. And then in the first iteration when state is none, see,\nfirst iteration when state is none, see,\nfirst iteration when state is none, see, you're taking the message from the\nyou're taking the message from the\nyou're taking the message from the input. Okay? input cell you are taking\ninput. Okay? input cell you are taking\ninput. Okay? input cell you are taking the message from and when the state is\nthe message from and when the state is\nthe message from and when the state is null you will have simple object like\nnull you will have simple object like\nnull you will have simple object like this but next time onwards whatever\nthis but next time onwards whatever\nthis but next time onwards whatever messages you have so after first\nmessages you have so after first\nmessages you have so after first iteration you will have one human\niteration you will have one human\niteration you will have one human message one AI message and then you\nmessage one AI message and then you\nmessage one AI message and then you append one that the new human message to\nappend one that the new human message to\nappend one that the new human message to that okay so that way our chat history\nthat okay so that way our chat history\nthat okay so that way our chat history is maintained so let me just run it so\nis maintained so let me just run it so\nis maintained so let me just run it so here who was the\nhere who was the\nhere who was the first person to walk\nfirst person to walk\nfirst person to walk on the moon. Print name only. Right? So\non the moon. Print name only. Right? So\non the moon. Print name only. Right? So when you do that, see it is saying Neil\nwhen you do that, see it is saying Neil\nwhen you do that, see it is saying Neil Armstrong. Now you can say, okay, which\nArmstrong. Now you can say, okay, which\nArmstrong. Now you can say, okay, which year? Which year?\nyear? Which year?\nyear? Which year? And it is saying 1969. See, so there is\nAnd it is saying 1969. See, so there is\nAnd it is saying 1969. See, so there is a context. Now you can ask related\na context. Now you can ask related\na context. Now you can ask related questions and it will work. Okay. When I\nquestions and it will work. Okay. When I\nquestions and it will work. Okay. When I ask this question, what is the latest\nask this question, what is the latest\nask this question, what is the latest price of MSFT stock to the chatbot that\nprice of MSFT stock to the chatbot that\nprice of MSFT stock to the chatbot that we just created? it will say I am unable\nwe just created? it will say I am unable\nwe just created? it will say I am unable to provide real-time stock prices\nto provide real-time stock prices\nto provide real-time stock prices because LLM's knowledge is cut off until\nbecause LLM's knowledge is cut off until\nbecause LLM's knowledge is cut off until certain date and in order to build\ncertain date and in order to build\ncertain date and in order to build useful agents you need to provide tools\nuseful agents you need to provide tools\nuseful agents you need to provide tools to agents. So when a person ask\nto agents. So when a person ask\nto agents. So when a person ask questions such as MSFT stock price LLM\nquestions such as MSFT stock price LLM\nquestions such as MSFT stock price LLM should be able to call Yahoo Finance API\nshould be able to call Yahoo Finance API\nshould be able to call Yahoo Finance API or some Python function to get the\nor some Python function to get the\nor some Python function to get the latest uh stock price. So we are going\nlatest uh stock price. So we are going\nlatest uh stock price. So we are going to now build uh a tool for this\nto now build uh a tool for this\nto now build uh a tool for this chatboard. Okay. So let me just\nchatboard. Okay. So let me just\nchatboard. Okay. So let me just unccommand this\nunccommand this\nunccommand this and I have created this four tool call.\nand I have created this four tool call.\nand I have created this four tool call. Okay. So right click jupyer notebook. I\nOkay. So right click jupyer notebook. I\nOkay. So right click jupyer notebook. I created it. I imported couple of\ncreated it. I imported couple of\ncreated it. I imported couple of necessary\nnecessary\nnecessary libraries and I will just create the llm\nlibraries and I will just create the llm\nlibraries and I will just create the llm in the same way that we did last time.\nin the same way that we did last time.\nin the same way that we did last time. Okay. So we just created LLM like this.\nOkay. So we just created LLM like this.\nOkay. So we just created LLM like this. But I want to provide this LLM access of\nBut I want to provide this LLM access of\nBut I want to provide this LLM access of a tool that can get stock prices. Now I\na tool that can get stock prices. Now I\na tool that can get stock prices. Now I don't want to go to the intricacies of\ndon't want to go to the intricacies of\ndon't want to go to the intricacies of calling Yahoo Finance API etc. What I'll\ncalling Yahoo Finance API etc. What I'll\ncalling Yahoo Finance API etc. What I'll do is I will just define a Python\ndo is I will just define a Python\ndo is I will just define a Python function and assume it is giving the\nfunction and assume it is giving the\nfunction and assume it is giving the latest stock price. Okay. So let's say\nlatest stock price. Okay. So let's say\nlatest stock price. Okay. So let's say this is the Python function. So I'll\nthis is the Python function. So I'll\nthis is the Python function. So I'll just copy paste. Save some time on\njust copy paste. Save some time on\njust copy paste. Save some time on typing. And all you're doing is passing\ntyping. And all you're doing is passing\ntyping. And all you're doing is passing the symbol Microsoft, Apple, etc. And it\nthe symbol Microsoft, Apple, etc. And it\nthe symbol Microsoft, Apple, etc. And it will just return some dummy value. Okay,\nwill just return some dummy value. Okay,\nwill just return some dummy value. Okay, in real life industry use case, you will\nin real life industry use case, you will\nin real life industry use case, you will call Yahoo Finance or whatever API. But\ncall Yahoo Finance or whatever API. But\ncall Yahoo Finance or whatever API. But for learning, this function is good\nfor learning, this function is good\nfor learning, this function is good enough. And you will annotate that as\nenough. And you will annotate that as\nenough. And you will annotate that as add tool. Okay, so tool is something\nadd tool. Okay, so tool is something\nadd tool. Okay, so tool is something that we have imported from lang chain\nthat we have imported from lang chain\nthat we have imported from lang chain core. And now we have this tool. Then\ncore. And now we have this tool. Then\ncore. And now we have this tool. Then you create this tools variable which\nyou create this tools variable which\nyou create this tools variable which contains all the tools. So let's say if\ncontains all the tools. So let's say if\ncontains all the tools. So let's say if you have second function you know you\nyou have second function you know you\nyou have second function you know you can have second function third function\ncan have second function third function\ncan have second function third function you can have a list of tools here and\nyou can have a list of tools here and\nyou can have a list of tools here and you will now create a variable called\nyou will now create a variable called\nyou will now create a variable called llm with tools and you will say llm\nllm with tools and you will say llm\nllm with tools and you will say llm dotbind actually there is another method\ndotbind actually there is another method\ndotbind actually there is another method llm.bind bind tools. Okay, let's execute\nllm.bind bind tools. Okay, let's execute\nllm.bind bind tools. Okay, let's execute this. So this is looking good and I have\nthis. So this is looking good and I have\nthis. So this is looking good and I have copy pasted same code. Okay, chatboard\ncopy pasted same code. Okay, chatboard\ncopy pasted same code. Okay, chatboard how you build graph everything remains\nhow you build graph everything remains\nhow you build graph everything remains same. Now here we are going to add one\nsame. Now here we are going to add one\nsame. Now here we are going to add one condition to add the access of tools to\ncondition to add the access of tools to\ncondition to add the access of tools to this chatboard which is builder dot add\nthis chatboard which is builder dot add\nthis chatboard which is builder dot add conditional age. See you want to call\nconditional age. See you want to call\nconditional age. See you want to call the tool only if required. If some\nthe tool only if required. If some\nthe tool only if required. If some person is asking question on stock price\nperson is asking question on stock price\nperson is asking question on stock price then it provide access to tool otherwise\nthen it provide access to tool otherwise\nthen it provide access to tool otherwise you don't need to that's why this is a\nyou don't need to that's why this is a\nyou don't need to that's why this is a conditional age which starts with h8\nconditional age which starts with h8\nconditional age which starts with h8 board and it will end in something\nboard and it will end in something\nboard and it will end in something called tools condition.\ncalled tools condition.\ncalled tools condition. Okay. Now tools condition is something\nOkay. Now tools condition is something\nOkay. Now tools condition is something that we have imported from lang graph\nthat we have imported from lang graph\nthat we have imported from lang graph pre-built and what this will do is it\npre-built and what this will do is it\npre-built and what this will do is it will return\nwill return\nwill return either tools or underscore and now what\neither tools or underscore and now what\neither tools or underscore and now what does that mean? Let me just show you. So\ndoes that mean? Let me just show you. So\ndoes that mean? Let me just show you. So here um and by the way I added the tools\nhere um and by the way I added the tools\nhere um and by the way I added the tools node as well. Okay so there are like two\nnode as well. Okay so there are like two\nnode as well. Okay so there are like two changes like this and this. So you added\nchanges like this and this. So you added\nchanges like this and this. So you added a node for chatboard then you added a\na node for chatboard then you added a\na node for chatboard then you added a node for tools and you have to just say\nnode for tools and you have to just say\nnode for tools and you have to just say tool node tools right so tools is this\ntool node tools right so tools is this\ntool node tools right so tools is this tool node tools and tool node is again a\ntool node tools and tool node is again a\ntool node tools and tool node is again a pre-built class that we have called and\npre-built class that we have called and\npre-built class that we have called and the second line that I added is add\nthe second line that I added is add\nthe second line that I added is add conditional age from chatboard to tools\nconditional age from chatboard to tools\nconditional age from chatboard to tools condition so let me execute this code to\ncondition so let me execute this code to\ncondition so let me execute this code to show you so you see here\nshow you so you see here\nshow you so you see here uh what is happening is\nuh what is happening is\nuh what is happening is From chatbot you have a conditional age\nFrom chatbot you have a conditional age\nFrom chatbot you have a conditional age going to tools. So why is it dotted?\ngoing to tools. So why is it dotted?\ngoing to tools. So why is it dotted? Because only if required then call\nBecause only if required then call\nBecause only if required then call tools. Otherwise chatboard can directly\ntools. Otherwise chatboard can directly\ntools. Otherwise chatboard can directly go to end. Okay. So chatbot is going to\ngo to end. Okay. So chatbot is going to\ngo to end. Okay. So chatbot is going to either tools or end. And that is what is\neither tools or end. And that is what is\neither tools or end. And that is what is specified by tools condition. See it is\nspecified by tools condition. See it is\nspecified by tools condition. See it is going to either tools which is this\ngoing to either tools which is this\ngoing to either tools which is this tools or end. Okay. So that's what this\ntools or end. Okay. So that's what this\ntools or end. Okay. So that's what this tool condition means. It means from\ntool condition means. It means from\ntool condition means. It means from chatboard when required go to tools\nchatboard when required go to tools\nchatboard when required go to tools otherwise if not required go to end.\notherwise if not required go to end.\notherwise if not required go to end. Okay. And um I think even if you don't\nOkay. And um I think even if you don't\nOkay. And um I think even if you don't do this should work. Okay. Let me just\ndo this should work. Okay. Let me just\ndo this should work. Okay. Let me just try this. Yeah. See. All right. So my\ntry this. Yeah. See. All right. So my\ntry this. Yeah. See. All right. So my this thing is done. Now I can just type\nthis thing is done. Now I can just type\nthis thing is done. Now I can just type in some message. So I'll just say what\nin some message. So I'll just say what\nin some message. So I'll just say what is the price of Amazon stock right now.\nis the price of Amazon stock right now.\nis the price of Amazon stock right now. and see 150. So it is making a tool call\nand see 150. So it is making a tool call\nand see 150. So it is making a tool call and it is retrieving 150. What is the\nand it is retrieving 150. What is the\nand it is retrieving 150. What is the price of apple? 100.4. Okay. So 100.4 is\nprice of apple? 100.4. Okay. So 100.4 is\nprice of apple? 100.4. Okay. So 100.4 is something that it should return. And\nsomething that it should return. And\nsomething that it should return. And when you look at the state here, watch\nwhen you look at the state here, watch\nwhen you look at the state here, watch this. This is very important. So you had\nthis. This is very important. So you had\nthis. This is very important. So you had a human message, right? What is the\na human message, right? What is the\na human message, right? What is the price of your original question? Then\nprice of your original question? Then\nprice of your original question? Then you have a AI message. Okay? And you\nyou have a AI message. Okay? And you\nyou have a AI message. Okay? And you have this tool call. So see tool\nhave this tool call. So see tool\nhave this tool call. So see tool message. So your tool is returning 100.4\nmessage. So your tool is returning 100.4\nmessage. So your tool is returning 100.4 and you call get stock price. Okay, you\nand you call get stock price. Okay, you\nand you call get stock price. Okay, you call this get stock price function.\ncall this get stock price function.\ncall this get stock price function. Okay, so here on the AI message you can\nOkay, so here on the AI message you can\nOkay, so here on the AI message you can see the exit function call. uh it is\nsee the exit function call. uh it is\nsee the exit function call. uh it is Apple get stock price and this is the\nApple get stock price and this is the\nApple get stock price and this is the beauty of LLM that from your natural\nbeauty of LLM that from your natural\nbeauty of LLM that from your natural question which is this it intelligently\nquestion which is this it intelligently\nquestion which is this it intelligently figured out that it needs to call this\nfigured out that it needs to call this\nfigured out that it needs to call this and how it did it uses this doc string\nand how it did it uses this doc string\nand how it did it uses this doc string you know it knows that I have access of\nyou know it knows that I have access of\nyou know it knows that I have access of this tool which will return the current\nthis tool which will return the current\nthis tool which will return the current price of a stock okay so from this it\nprice of a stock okay so from this it\nprice of a stock okay so from this it extracted apple as a stock ticker then\nextracted apple as a stock ticker then\nextracted apple as a stock ticker then it called this function okay uh and if\nit called this function okay uh and if\nit called this function okay uh and if you look at the state you see that\nyou look at the state you see that\nyou look at the state you see that function call see function call argument\nfunction call see function call argument\nfunction call see function call argument symbol apple get stock price and the\nsymbol apple get stock price and the\nsymbol apple get stock price and the result is nothing but a simple tool\nresult is nothing but a simple tool\nresult is nothing but a simple tool message so 100.4 before was a tool\nmessage so 100.4 before was a tool\nmessage so 100.4 before was a tool message which you just directly return\nmessage which you just directly return\nmessage which you just directly return to it. But now when I ask a different\nto it. But now when I ask a different\nto it. But now when I ask a different question, let's say I ask who invented\nquestion, let's say I ask who invented\nquestion, let's say I ask who invented the theory of relativity in that case it\nthe theory of relativity in that case it\nthe theory of relativity in that case it will not call tool. See, you don't see\nwill not call tool. See, you don't see\nwill not call tool. See, you don't see any tool message. So it is smartly\nany tool message. So it is smartly\nany tool message. So it is smartly figuring out what needs to be done here.\nfiguring out what needs to be done here.\nfiguring out what needs to be done here. Now let's say I ask this question. I\nNow let's say I ask this question. I\nNow let's say I ask this question. I want to buy 20 Amazon stocks then 15\nwant to buy 20 Amazon stocks then 15\nwant to buy 20 Amazon stocks then 15 MST. What will be the total cost? Pause\nMST. What will be the total cost? Pause\nMST. What will be the total cost? Pause this video and tell me what will happen.\nthis video and tell me what will happen.\nthis video and tell me what will happen. Well, you will think that it will first\nWell, you will think that it will first\nWell, you will think that it will first retrieve Amazon 20 stocks then 15 MS FT\nretrieve Amazon 20 stocks then 15 MS FT\nretrieve Amazon 20 stocks then 15 MS FT and it will tell you the total. See, no,\nand it will tell you the total. See, no,\nand it will tell you the total. See, no, it did not work as per our expectation.\nit did not work as per our expectation.\nit did not work as per our expectation. So, what it did is it retrieved the MSFT\nSo, what it did is it retrieved the MSFT\nSo, what it did is it retrieved the MSFT stock price I think MSF yeah 200.3.\nstock price I think MSF yeah 200.3.\nstock price I think MSF yeah 200.3. So, it made this second tool call,\nSo, it made this second tool call,\nSo, it made this second tool call, right? And it just retrieved this thing.\nright? And it just retrieved this thing.\nright? And it just retrieved this thing. It did not do this math actually. So if\nIt did not do this math actually. So if\nIt did not do this math actually. So if you look at this state see you see the\nyou look at this state see you see the\nyou look at this state see you see the it made two tool calls actually and 150\nit made two tool calls actually and 150\nit made two tool calls actually and 150 and 200 but it is not taking that\nand 200 but it is not taking that\nand 200 but it is not taking that response back to LLM and LLM should say\nresponse back to LLM and LLM should say\nresponse back to LLM and LLM should say okay I have this price of MS50 this\nokay I have this price of MS50 this\nokay I have this price of MS50 this price of Amazon let me add up and let me\nprice of Amazon let me add up and let me\nprice of Amazon let me add up and let me give you the comprehensive final answer.\ngive you the comprehensive final answer.\ngive you the comprehensive final answer. It is not doing that. So this needs some\nIt is not doing that. So this needs some\nIt is not doing that. So this needs some update. Okay. So for that I will just\nupdate. Okay. So for that I will just\nupdate. Okay. So for that I will just copy paste. So let let's keep this as it\ncopy paste. So let let's keep this as it\ncopy paste. So let let's keep this as it is and Ctrl Ctrl + V and let's call this\nis and Ctrl Ctrl + V and let's call this\nis and Ctrl Ctrl + V and let's call this tool call agent. Now I want to call it\ntool call agent. Now I want to call it\ntool call agent. Now I want to call it agent because I want to make it more\nagent because I want to make it more\nagent because I want to make it more intelligent. Okay. And the only change\nintelligent. Okay. And the only change\nintelligent. Okay. And the only change you will do here is see right now when\nyou will do here is see right now when\nyou will do here is see right now when you make a tool call it will go directly\nyou make a tool call it will go directly\nyou make a tool call it will go directly to the end but you want the response\nto the end but you want the response\nto the end but you want the response from tool to go back to chatbot. So for\nfrom tool to go back to chatbot. So for\nfrom tool to go back to chatbot. So for that you will simply say builder dot add\nthat you will simply say builder dot add\nthat you will simply say builder dot add age\nage\nage from tools let's go back to chatbot\nfrom tools let's go back to chatbot\nfrom tools let's go back to chatbot so now okay I need to execute all of\nso now okay I need to execute all of\nso now okay I need to execute all of this okay so let's execute all the cells\nthis okay so let's execute all the cells\nthis okay so let's execute all the cells step by step so look at this chart\nstep by step so look at this chart\nstep by step so look at this chart now from tools also it is going to this\nnow from tools also it is going to this\nnow from tools also it is going to this chatboard so this is becoming agentic\nchatboard so this is becoming agentic\nchatboard so this is becoming agentic now Okay. So let me just show you how\nnow Okay. So let me just show you how\nnow Okay. So let me just show you how exactly it is agentic.\nexactly it is agentic.\nexactly it is agentic. So this I think let me just directly run\nSo this I think let me just directly run\nSo this I think let me just directly run this. See now it is reasoning. Okay. And\nthis. See now it is reasoning. Okay. And\nthis. See now it is reasoning. Okay. And if you look at the state\nif you look at the state\nif you look at the state um\num\num it made those two tool calls right? One\nit made those two tool calls right? One\nit made those two tool calls right? One for Amazon second for MSFT. And then\nfor Amazon second for MSFT. And then\nfor Amazon second for MSFT. And then again it made an AI call. See and it\nagain it made an AI call. See and it\nagain it made an AI call. See and it told you the final result. So it is\ntold you the final result. So it is\ntold you the final result. So it is truly agentic because what happens is\ntruly agentic because what happens is\ntruly agentic because what happens is you have let's say your chatbot okay so\nyou have let's say your chatbot okay so\nyou have let's say your chatbot okay so let's say your chatbot is an LLM based\nlet's say your chatbot is an LLM based\nlet's say your chatbot is an LLM based and then you are calling these tools\nand then you are calling these tools\nand then you are calling these tools okay so let's say you're calling this\nokay so let's say you're calling this\nokay so let's say you're calling this tool to get the stock price and from\ntool to get the stock price and from\ntool to get the stock price and from here you go back and here is the\nhere you go back and here is the\nhere you go back and here is the response right so this is a question and\nresponse right so this is a question and\nresponse right so this is a question and this is a response\nthis is a response\nthis is a response so first it will uh call it for Amazon.\nso first it will uh call it for Amazon.\nso first it will uh call it for Amazon. Okay. So, Amazon. Okay. Let's say\nOkay. So, Amazon. Okay. Let's say\nOkay. So, Amazon. Okay. Let's say whatever is the Amazon price. Okay.\nwhatever is the Amazon price. Okay.\nwhatever is the Amazon price. Okay. Let's say 10.\nLet's say 10.\nLet's say 10. So, 10 goes here. Okay. Then again it\nSo, 10 goes here. Okay. Then again it\nSo, 10 goes here. Okay. Then again it calls it for MSFT.\ncalls it for MSFT.\ncalls it for MSFT. What is the MSFT stock price? Let's say\nWhat is the MSFT stock price? Let's say\nWhat is the MSFT stock price? Let's say 20. So, 20 goes again here. And it will\n20. So, 20 goes again here. And it will\n20. So, 20 goes again here. And it will do the reasoning. So, it is doing like\ndo the reasoning. So, it is doing like\ndo the reasoning. So, it is doing like multi-step planning almost. I mean, I\nmulti-step planning almost. I mean, I\nmulti-step planning almost. I mean, I know it's simple but it is doing those\nknow it's simple but it is doing those\nknow it's simple but it is doing those multiple iterations. And therefore if\nmultiple iterations. And therefore if\nmultiple iterations. And therefore if you remember our definition of agent AKI\nyou remember our definition of agent AKI\nyou remember our definition of agent AKI when you give it a tool access it should\nwhen you give it a tool access it should\nwhen you give it a tool access it should be able to call the tool whenever\nbe able to call the tool whenever\nbe able to call the tool whenever required and it should be able to take\nrequired and it should be able to take\nrequired and it should be able to take back all those response and generate a\nback all those response and generate a\nback all those response and generate a comprehensive final output. Let's talk\ncomprehensive final output. Let's talk\ncomprehensive final output. Let's talk about memory. Now when you are doing a\nabout memory. Now when you are doing a\nabout memory. Now when you are doing a conversation with chatboard you need to\nconversation with chatboard you need to\nconversation with chatboard you need to maintain a context. So let's say if you\nmaintain a context. So let's say if you\nmaintain a context. So let's say if you ask a question I want to buy 10 Reliance\nask a question I want to buy 10 Reliance\nask a question I want to buy 10 Reliance stocks. What is the price? There will be\nstocks. What is the price? There will be\nstocks. What is the price? There will be price. then you can say I want to buy\nprice. then you can say I want to buy\nprice. then you can say I want to buy five MSFT stocks and add the price to\nfive MSFT stocks and add the price to\nfive MSFT stocks and add the price to the previous total. So it needs to know\nthe previous total. So it needs to know\nthe previous total. So it needs to know what happened previously. Okay,\nwhat happened previously. Okay,\nwhat happened previously. Okay, therefore memory is important. And in\ntherefore memory is important. And in\ntherefore memory is important. And in our code previously we used simple\nour code previously we used simple\nour code previously we used simple Python list. So if you look at this one,\nPython list. So if you look at this one,\nPython list. So if you look at this one, you see we used Python coding and Python\nyou see we used Python coding and Python\nyou see we used Python coding and Python list to append messages to the previous\nlist to append messages to the previous\nlist to append messages to the previous chat history. And this is not a very\nchat history. And this is not a very\nchat history. And this is not a very efficient way of maintaining memory.\nefficient way of maintaining memory.\nefficient way of maintaining memory. Lang graph provides inbuilt constructs\nLang graph provides inbuilt constructs\nLang graph provides inbuilt constructs to save the memory. Okay. So we will\nto save the memory. Okay. So we will\nto save the memory. Okay. So we will look into that. So this way works but\nlook into that. So this way works but\nlook into that. So this way works but it's not very efficient. You might run\nit's not very efficient. You might run\nit's not very efficient. You might run into the issues. So we will look at the\ninto the issues. So we will look at the\ninto the issues. So we will look at the proper way using lang graph inbuilt\nproper way using lang graph inbuilt\nproper way using lang graph inbuilt methods. I'm going to click here crl +\nmethods. I'm going to click here crl +\nmethods. I'm going to click here crl + v. Okay. Just copy pasting the last\nv. Okay. Just copy pasting the last\nv. Okay. Just copy pasting the last notebook. Let's call it memory.\nnotebook. Let's call it memory.\nnotebook. Let's call it memory. And first let's understand what happens\nAnd first let's understand what happens\nAnd first let's understand what happens if you don't have memory. So here if you\nif you don't have memory. So here if you\nif you don't have memory. So here if you click on this button it will just run\nclick on this button it will just run\nclick on this button it will just run all the cells. And now see let's say if\nall the cells. And now see let's say if\nall the cells. And now see let's say if I ask a different question which is\nI ask a different question which is\nI ask a different question which is uh\nuh\nuh get me the current price of\nget me the current price of\nget me the current price of a real stock. Okay. get me the\nand tell me\nand tell me how many or using a current price. You\nhow many or using a current price. You\nhow many or using a current price. You can just say using the current price,\ncan just say using the current price,\ncan just say using the current price, tell me the total\ntell me the total\ntell me the total price of 20 10 real stocks\nprice of 20 10 real stocks\nprice of 20 10 real stocks and add it to previous total. Tell me\nand add it to previous total. Tell me\nand add it to previous total. Tell me will this work or not?\nwill this work or not?\nwill this work or not? See could you please provide the\nSee could you please provide the\nSee could you please provide the previous to it doesn't know what\nprevious to it doesn't know what\nprevious to it doesn't know what happened previously. So let's use\nhappened previously. So let's use\nhappened previously. So let's use uh this thing called checkpoint memory.\nuh this thing called checkpoint memory.\nuh this thing called checkpoint memory. So if you look at the documentation\nSo if you look at the documentation\nSo if you look at the documentation you can import this from lang graph\nyou can import this from lang graph\nyou can import this from lang graph checkpoint memory import memory saver.\ncheckpoint memory import memory saver.\ncheckpoint memory import memory saver. Okay. So let me import that here.\nOkay. So let me import that here.\nOkay. So let me import that here. I think you can import anywhere. So I'm\nI think you can import anywhere. So I'm\nI think you can import anywhere. So I'm going to import here.\ngoing to import here.\ngoing to import here. Okay, so you are importing this object\nOkay, so you are importing this object\nOkay, so you are importing this object of memory saver class and then this\nof memory saver class and then this\nof memory saver class and then this memory you will provide while compiling\nmemory you will provide while compiling\nmemory you will provide while compiling a graph.\na graph.\na graph. So here you will say check pointer is is\nSo here you will say check pointer is is\nSo here you will say check pointer is is equal to memory. Okay, so you created\nequal to memory. Okay, so you created\nequal to memory. Okay, so you created the object while compiling the graph you\nthe object while compiling the graph you\nthe object while compiling the graph you are saying that take this object of\nare saying that take this object of\nare saying that take this object of memory. We are not done yet. So one last\nmemory. We are not done yet. So one last\nmemory. We are not done yet. So one last step is\nstep is\nstep is when you invoke this method. Okay. So\nwhen you invoke this method. Okay. So\nwhen you invoke this method. Okay. So let me just remove this. You need to\nlet me just remove this. You need to\nlet me just remove this. You need to provide something called config\nprovide something called config\nprovide something called config which is a dictionary that will say\nwhich is a dictionary that will say\nwhich is a dictionary that will say configurable\nconfigurable\nconfigurable and thread ID. Th trade ID let's say my\nand thread ID. Th trade ID let's say my\nand thread ID. Th trade ID let's say my thread ID is one. I'll tell you the\nthread ID is one. I'll tell you the\nthread ID is one. I'll tell you the value of this thread ID later on. But\nvalue of this thread ID later on. But\nvalue of this thread ID later on. But for now when you invoke this graph,\nfor now when you invoke this graph,\nfor now when you invoke this graph, let's pass this config.\nConfig is equal to config. Okay.\nConfig is equal to config. Okay. So you got the total price of April\nSo you got the total price of April\nSo you got the total price of April stocks. Okay. 100.4.\nstocks. Okay. 100.4.\nstocks. Okay. 100.4.

So now when I run this, it will tell me\nSo now when I run this, it will tell me\nSo now when I run this, it will tell me 6,04 is the total price. And when I run\n6,04 is the total price. And when I run\n6,04 is the total price. And when I run that, okay, so here is not working\nthat, okay, so here is not working\nthat, okay, so here is not working because apparently I did not execute the\nbecause apparently I did not execute the\nbecause apparently I did not execute the previous code. So let's execute by\nprevious code. So let's execute by\nprevious code. So let's execute by clicking on run all and see what\nclicking on run all and see what\nclicking on run all and see what happens.\nhappens.\nhappens. See now it worked. Previously the price\nSee now it worked. Previously the price\nSee now it worked. Previously the price was 64. Now 64 + 876 68 80. Isn't this\nwas 64. Now 64 + 876 68 80. Isn't this\nwas 64. Now 64 + 876 68 80. Isn't this amazing? Now you can maintain two\namazing? Now you can maintain two\namazing? Now you can maintain two different threads also. So let me show\ndifferent threads also. So let me show\ndifferent threads also. So let me show you. So say if I add a new cell here.\nyou. So say if I add a new cell here.\nyou. So say if I add a new cell here. Okay. So let me how do I add a new cell?\nOkay. So let me how do I add a new cell?\nOkay. So let me how do I add a new cell? You can press button B to add a new\nYou can press button B to add a new\nYou can press button B to add a new cell.\ncell.\ncell. And let's assume\nAnd let's assume\nAnd let's assume here I'm creating a different thread ID.\nhere I'm creating a different thread ID.\nhere I'm creating a different thread ID. Different thread ID. Okay, thread ID\nDifferent thread ID. Okay, thread ID\nDifferent thread ID. Okay, thread ID too. And here I will say uh let's pick\ntoo. And here I will say uh let's pick\ntoo. And here I will say uh let's pick another stock Apple. Okay.\nanother stock Apple. Okay.\nanother stock Apple. Okay. Tell me the current price of\nTell me the current price of\nTell me the current price of five\nfive\nfive Apple stocks.\nApple stocks.\nApple stocks. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And here the thread ID is two. So when\nAnd here the thread ID is two. So when\nAnd here the thread ID is two. So when you run it,\nyou run it,\nyou run it, see the current price of Apple stock is\nsee the current price of Apple stock is\nsee the current price of Apple stock is this. And you're saying like first I'm\nthis. And you're saying like first I'm\nthis. And you're saying like first I'm having thread ID 1 then I have thread ID\nhaving thread ID 1 then I have thread ID\nhaving thread ID 1 then I have thread ID 2 thread ID 1 again. So let me just get\n2 thread ID 1 again. So let me just get\n2 thread ID 1 again. So let me just get thread ID. You know what I I think I\nthread ID. You know what I I think I\nthread ID. You know what I I think I need to call it config 1 and two. So\nneed to call it config 1 and two. So\nneed to call it config 1 and two. So config one is this. Config 2 is this.\nconfig one is this. Config 2 is this.\nconfig one is this. Config 2 is this. Okay. So here I'm passing config 2. Here\nOkay. So here I'm passing config 2. Here\nOkay. So here I'm passing config 2. Here I'm passing config one.\nI'm passing config one.\nI'm passing config one. Um\nUm\nUm and then\nuh you will say something else. So tell\nuh you will say something else. So tell me the current price of five MS stocks\nme the current price of five MS stocks\nme the current price of five MS stocks and\nand\nand add it to\nadd it to\nadd it to previous total.\nprevious total.\nprevious total. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And just to be on a safe side, I will\nAnd just to be on a safe side, I will\nAnd just to be on a safe side, I will just execute all the cells. So make sure\njust execute all the cells. So make sure\njust execute all the cells. So make sure you are passing config 2 here. Okay,\nyou are passing config 2 here. Okay,\nyou are passing config 2 here. Okay, config 1, config 2, and config 1. So the\nconfig 1, config 2, and config 1. So the\nconfig 1, config 2, and config 1. So the output of config 1 was $6,04.\noutput of config 1 was $6,04.\noutput of config 1 was $6,04. Correct? And in config 1 again when I\nCorrect? And in config 1 again when I\nCorrect? And in config 1 again when I said, okay, add it to previous total. It\nsaid, okay, add it to previous total. It\nsaid, okay, add it to previous total. It did not remember Apple's total, but it\ndid not remember Apple's total, but it\ndid not remember Apple's total, but it remember this. See, 6,04 is a previous\nremember this. See, 6,04 is a previous\nremember this. See, 6,04 is a previous total. I hope you're getting it. It's\ntotal. I hope you're getting it. It's\ntotal. I hope you're getting it. It's pretty common sense. So it is\npretty common sense. So it is\npretty common sense. So it is maintaining two different thread\nmaintaining two different thread\nmaintaining two different thread context. Okay. So if I to uh draw a\ncontext. Okay. So if I to uh draw a\ncontext. Okay. So if I to uh draw a picture, it will look something like\npicture, it will look something like\npicture, it will look something like this where I have two threads. Okay. So\nthis where I have two threads. Okay. So\nthis where I have two threads. Okay. So I have\nI have\nI have thread one\nthread one\nthread one and then this one is\nand then this one is\nand then this one is a thread two. Okay. Okay. So in a thread\na thread two. Okay. Okay. So in a thread\na thread two. Okay. Okay. So in a thread one in thread two if you look at just\none in thread two if you look at just\none in thread two if you look at just thread two we ask for five apple stock\nthread two we ask for five apple stock\nthread two we ask for five apple stock price which is $502 right? So here\nprice which is $502 right? So here\nprice which is $502 right? So here five\nfive\nfive apple and the price is $502\napple and the price is $502\napple and the price is $502 and then you add\nand then you add\nand then you add 5 msft. So the five msft\n5 msft. So the five msft\n5 msft. So the five msft is 1, right? So 5 MSFT.\nis 1, right? So 5 MSFT.\nis 1, right? So 5 MSFT. So 5 MSFT\nSo 5 MSFT\nSo 5 MSFT is 1,1 and it is just adding these two.\nis 1,1 and it is just adding these two.\nis 1,1 and it is just adding these two. So when it adds that you get 15\nSo when it adds that you get 15\nSo when it adds that you get 15 03,\n03,\n03, right? So this is my\nright? So this is my\nright? So this is my thread two execution. But when I look at\nthread two execution. But when I look at\nthread two execution. But when I look at thread one u we asked for\nthread one u we asked for\nthread one u we asked for we asked this question which where we\nwe asked this question which where we\nwe asked this question which where we got 64 and in that 64\ngot 64 and in that 64\ngot 64 and in that 64 you are adding 876 see 876 you are\nyou are adding 876 see 876 you are\nyou are adding 876 see 876 you are adding to 64.\nadding to 64.\nadding to 64. So this um memory is used not only to\nSo this um memory is used not only to\nSo this um memory is used not only to maintain context around different\nmaintain context around different\nmaintain context around different threads but it is also useful to resume\nthreads but it is also useful to resume\nthreads but it is also useful to resume complex state any time for error\ncomplex state any time for error\ncomplex state any time for error recovery or human in the workflow. Okay.\nrecovery or human in the workflow. Okay.\nrecovery or human in the workflow. Okay.

Just a simple Python file which has get\nJust a simple Python file which has get\nJust a simple Python file which has get stock price tool. We have written this\nstock price tool. We have written this\nstock price tool. We have written this code before. So it shouldn't be a\ncode before. So it shouldn't be a\ncode before. So it shouldn't be a surprise. When you run it, you ask the\nsurprise. When you run it, you ask the\nsurprise. When you run it, you ask the price of 10 MS50 stocks and it will tell\nprice of 10 MS50 stocks and it will tell\nprice of 10 MS50 stocks and it will tell you. Now let's add another tool to buy\nyou. Now let's add another tool to buy\nyou. Now let's add another tool to buy the stocks. Okay? So we will say tool\nthe stocks. Okay? So we will say tool\nthe stocks. Okay? So we will say tool and uh\nand uh\nand uh buy stocks.\nbuy stocks.\nbuy stocks. Okay. So here let's say I will also add\nOkay. So here let's say I will also add\nOkay.

I I I don't want to go ahead and connect\nI I don't want to go ahead and connect\nI I don't want to go ahead and connect it with my Robin Hood account and\nit with my Robin Hood account and\nit with my Robin Hood account and execute the trade for real. Okay. a\nexecute the trade for real. Okay. a\nexecute the trade for real. Okay. a learning tutorial but in real life you\nlearning tutorial but in real life you\nlearning tutorial but in real life you will have some API integration you are\nwill have some API integration you are\nwill have some API integration you are calling whatever your stock brokerage\ncalling whatever your stock brokerage\ncalling whatever your stock brokerage accounts API to execute it okay so you\naccounts API to execute it okay so you\naccounts API to execute it okay so you bought this quantity share for a total\nbought this quantity share for a total\nbought this quantity share for a total price of this very simple and then add\nprice of this very simple and then add\nprice of this very simple and then add that to this particular tools array and\nthat to this particular tools array and\nthat to this particular tools array and then tools will go to llm with tools\nthen tools will go to llm with tools\nthen tools will go to llm with tools okay so now let's execute that Okay. So\nokay so now let's execute that Okay. So\nokay so now let's execute that Okay. So here I am going to add a second step\nhere I am going to add a second step\nhere I am going to add a second step saying that buy 10 MSFT\nsaying that buy 10 MSFT\nsaying that buy 10 MSFT stocks\nstocks\nstocks at current price.

Now I want to add the human in the loop component\nto add the human in the loop component\nto add the human in the loop component for which we will use this interrupt\nfor which we will use this interrupt\nfor which we will use this interrupt function. So if you look at their\nfunction. So if you look at their\nfunction. So if you look at their documentation they have this interrupt\ndocumentation they have this interrupt\ndocumentation they have this interrupt function which is similar to input\nfunction which is similar to input\nfunction which is similar to input function in Python. Whenever you want to\nfunction in Python. Whenever you want to\nfunction in Python. Whenever you want to take input from Python right like let's\ntake input from Python right like let's\ntake input from Python right like let's say okay should I execute this trade?\nsay okay should I execute this trade?\nsay okay should I execute this trade? Yes and no. We use input function right?\nYes and no. We use input function right?\nYes and no. We use input function right? Interrupt is a similar function. So if\nInterrupt is a similar function. So if\nInterrupt is a similar function. So if you look at the documentation\nyou look at the documentation\nyou look at the documentation you know this is how you interrupt. So\nyou know this is how you interrupt. So\nyou know this is how you interrupt. So let me copy paste this to import that\nlet me copy paste this to import that\nlet me copy paste this to import that first obviously and then I will not buy\nfirst obviously and then I will not buy\nfirst obviously and then I will not buy the stocks directly. I will just say\nthe stocks directly. I will just say\nthe stocks directly. I will just say interrupt and I will say approve buying\ninterrupt and I will say approve buying\ninterrupt and I will say approve buying this much right this stocks and that\nthis much right this stocks and that\nthis much right this stocks and that will be your decision and if decision\nwill be your decision and if decision\nwill be your decision and if decision is equal to yes then do this\nis equal to yes then do this\nis equal to yes then do this otherwise buying decline. Okay.\notherwise buying decline. Okay.\notherwise buying decline. Okay. Now whenever it is executing and when it\nNow whenever it is executing and when it\nNow whenever it is executing and when it comes to this node when it encounters\ncomes to this node when it encounters\ncomes to this node when it encounters this line it will stop execution and it\nthis line it will stop execution and it\nthis line it will stop execution and it will ask for human input. So how do you\nwill ask for human input. So how do you\nwill ask for human input. So how do you know it has stopped the execution? Well\nknow it has stopped the execution? Well\nknow it has stopped the execution? Well here in this code uh you can just print\nhere in this code uh you can just print\nhere in this code uh you can just print I'll just copy paste here. So you can\nI'll just copy paste here. So you can\nI'll just copy paste here. So you can just print here\njust print here\njust print here state.get interrupt. Okay. So when you\nstate.get interrupt. Okay. So when you\nstate.get interrupt. Okay. So when you do this see it will print this value\ndo this see it will print this value\ndo this see it will print this value which means the graph execution has\nwhich means the graph execution has\nwhich means the graph execution has interrupted right. So if you look at our\ninterrupted right. So if you look at our\ninterrupted right. So if you look at our particular graph uh the graph nodes if\nparticular graph uh the graph nodes if\nparticular graph uh the graph nodes if you think about it right we have start\nyou think about it right we have start\nyou think about it right we have start node then we have get stock prices tool\nnode then we have get stock prices tool\nnode then we have get stock prices tool right so we have a chatbot actually so\nright so we have a chatbot actually so\nright so we have a chatbot actually so this is chatbot and then it has access\nthis is chatbot and then it has access\nthis is chatbot and then it has access to the tools so you have seen the dotted\nto the tools so you have seen the dotted\nto the tools so you have seen the dotted line right so tools and in tools both\nline right so tools and in tools both\nline right so tools and in tools both the tools get prize as well as execute\nthe tools get prize as well as execute\nthe tools get prize as well as execute and there is this and then there is and\nand there is this and then there is and\nand there is this and then there is and correct. So now what happens is when\ncorrect. So now what happens is when\ncorrect. So now what happens is when you're buying a stock see it will come\nyou're buying a stock see it will come\nyou're buying a stock see it will come through this nodes right? So it's in a\nthrough this nodes right? So it's in a\nthrough this nodes right? So it's in a chatboard it will make a tool call. So\nchatboard it will make a tool call. So\nchatboard it will make a tool call. So it will call buy tools and then it will\nit will call buy tools and then it will\nit will call buy tools and then it will stop here. It will not go further ahead.\nstop here. It will not go further ahead.\nstop here. It will not go further ahead. It will just stop. And here is where\nIt will just stop. And here is where\nIt will just stop. And here is where human in the loop right? So human in the\nhuman in the loop right? So human in the\nhuman in the loop right? So human in the loop will come in play where you will\nloop will come in play where you will\nloop will come in play where you will give some kind of output and then it\ngive some kind of output and then it\ngive some kind of output and then it will uh finish the remaining execution.\nwill uh finish the remaining execution.\nwill uh finish the remaining execution. It's very straightforward folks. So I\nIt's very straightforward folks. So I\nIt's very straightforward folks. So I hope you're getting it.\nhope you're getting it.\nhope you're getting it. So to get that here using Python input\nSo to get that here using Python input\nSo to get that here using Python input function I will say okay um do you want\nfunction I will say okay um do you want\nfunction I will say okay um do you want to approve like approve\nyes no\nyes no you want to approve that and once you\nyou want to approve that and once you\nyou want to approve that and once you have the decision you will say graph dot\nhave the decision you will say graph dot\nhave the decision you will say graph dot invoke\ninvoke\ninvoke command.\ncommand.\ncommand. See, so you are passing decision through\nSee, so you are passing decision through\nSee, so you are passing decision through command. So what command will do is\ncommand. So what command will do is\ncommand. So what command will do is whatever is decision, right? Either yes\nwhatever is decision, right? Either yes\nwhatever is decision, right? Either yes or no, it will put it here as an output\nor no, it will put it here as an output\nor no, it will put it here as an output of the interrupt. So when you call\nof the interrupt. So when you call\nof the interrupt. So when you call interrupt, it will be blocked. And when\ninterrupt, it will be blocked. And when\ninterrupt, it will be blocked. And when you say command\nyou say command\nyou say command decision,\ndecision,\ndecision, it will\nit will\nit will actually this\nactually this\nactually this this is the name of the argument. So in\nthis is the name of the argument. So in\nthis is the name of the argument. So in command you're saying resume wherever\ncommand you're saying resume wherever\ncommand you're saying resume wherever you're blocked resume with this\nyou're blocked resume with this\nyou're blocked resume with this particular decision which is yes. So let\nparticular decision which is yes. So let\nparticular decision which is yes. So let me just run it so you get an idea. Um so\nme just run it so you get an idea. Um so\nme just run it so you get an idea. Um so here it should ask\nhere it should ask\nhere it should ask yes. See approve buying this. Now you\nyes. See approve buying this. Now you\nyes. See approve buying this. Now you will say yes no. So you will say yes\nwill say yes no. So you will say yes\nwill say yes no. So you will say yes and when you say yes it will\nand when you say yes it will\nand when you say yes it will okay let me see. So when I said yes\nokay let me see. So when I said yes\nokay let me see. So when I said yes actually it worked. I should have\nactually it worked. I should have\nactually it worked. I should have printed actually here. Uh let me just\nprinted actually here. Uh let me just\nprinted actually here. Uh let me just print this thing. I forgot to print that\nprint this thing. I forgot to print that\nprint this thing. I forgot to print that state actually that's why.\nstate actually that's why.\nstate actually that's why. Okay. So approve. Yes. And it will say\nOkay. So approve. Yes. And it will say\nOkay. So approve. Yes. And it will say um all right. Let me just debug it to\num all right. Let me just debug it to\num all right. Let me just debug it to see what's going on. So I'll put a break\nsee what's going on. So I'll put a break\nsee what's going on. So I'll put a break point here.\npoint here.\npoint here. And let's run this. I hope this\nAnd let's run this. I hope this\nAnd let's run this. I hope this interrupt and PyCharm's debugger\ninterrupt and PyCharm's debugger\ninterrupt and PyCharm's debugger interrupt kind of works well in the\ninterrupt kind of works well in the\ninterrupt kind of works well in the sync. Okay, approve. You will say yes.\nsync. Okay, approve. You will say yes.\nsync. Okay, approve. You will say yes. You see decision you got it as yes. So\nYou see decision you got it as yes. So\nYou see decision you got it as yes. So it is a working as expected. So when you\nit is a working as expected. So when you\nit is a working as expected. So when you do this, it should return that that.\ndo this, it should return that that.\ndo this, it should return that that. Okay, an obvious mistake that I was\nOkay, an obvious mistake that I was\nOkay, an obvious mistake that I was making was I need to get this back in\nmaking was I need to get this back in\nmaking was I need to get this back in state. Okay, so that was a problem. So I\nstate. Okay, so that was a problem. So I\nstate. Okay, so that was a problem. So I was not returning that state back into\nwas not returning that state back into\nwas not returning that state back into this variable. So now when you say\nthis variable. So now when you say\nthis variable. So now when you say approve yes it should say you bought 10\napprove yes it should say you bought 10\napprove yes it should say you bought 10 stocks and if you say approval no\nstocks and if you say approval no\nstocks and if you say approval no let me try that no\nlet me try that no\nlet me try that no see I was not able to buy stocks buying\nsee I was not able to buy stocks buying\nsee I was not able to buy stocks buying decline so it this one will return\ndecline so it this one will return\ndecline so it this one will return buying decline but then llm will enhance\nbuying decline but then llm will enhance\nbuying decline but then llm will enhance the output and it will add that the line\nthe output and it will add that the line\nthe output and it will add that the line might look something different so I hope\nmight look something different so I hope\nmight look something different so I hope you got a some idea on you know how you\nyou got a some idea on you know how you\nyou got a some idea on you know how you can involve all humans in the agent AI\ncan involve all humans in the agent AI\ncan involve all humans in the agent AI workflows using\nworkflows using\nworkflows using the interrupt and command.

Now admittedly this is going to be a\nadmittedly this is going to be a\nadmittedly this is going to be a completely theoretical section but it\ncompletely theoretical section but it\ncompletely theoretical section but it will be short and brief. I promise. The\nwill be short and brief. I promise. The\nwill be short and brief. I promise. The reason I've kept this specific section\nreason I've kept this specific section\nreason I've kept this specific section in the course is because when we do\nin the course is because when we do\nin the course is because when we do eventually go on to code uh our AI\neventually go on to code uh our AI\neventually go on to code uh our AI agents, our graphs and langraph, these\nagents, our graphs and langraph, these\nagents, our graphs and langraph, these will start popping up everywhere. And I\nwill start popping up everywhere. And I\nwill start popping up everywhere. And I don't really want you to look start\ndon't really want you to look start\ndon't really want you to look start coding without ever having seen these\ncoding without ever having seen these\ncoding without ever having seen these before or really not knowing what these\nbefore or really not knowing what these\nbefore or really not knowing what these actually are. So that's why I've kept it\nactually are. So that's why I've kept it\nactually are. So that's why I've kept it here. But I promise this will be short\nhere. But I promise this will be short\nhere. But I promise this will be short and brief. Cool. Okay. Let's begin with\nand brief. Cool. Okay. Let's begin with\nand brief. Cool. Okay. Let's begin with dictionaries. Now dictionaries are a\ndictionaries. Now dictionaries are a\ndictionaries. Now dictionaries are a data structure. Yes, but there's a\ndata structure. Yes, but there's a\ndata structure. Yes, but there's a reason I've kept it here. So let's see\nreason I've kept it here. So let's see\nreason I've kept it here. So let's see how a dictionary is described in Python.\nhow a dictionary is described in Python.\nhow a dictionary is described in Python. You should already know this. So in this\nYou should already know this. So in this\nYou should already know this. So in this case, I've described a very simple\ncase, I've described a very simple\ncase, I've described a very simple dictionary called uh movie. and it has\ndictionary called uh movie. and it has\ndictionary called uh movie. and it has two keys, the name and the year. And it\ntwo keys, the name and the year. And it\ntwo keys, the name and the year. And it has two values, Avengers Endgame and\nhas two values, Avengers Endgame and\nhas two values, Avengers Endgame and 2019. Now, dictionaries are awesome,\n2019. Now, dictionaries are awesome,\n2019. Now, dictionaries are awesome, don't get me wrong. They're they allow\ndon't get me wrong. They're they allow\ndon't get me wrong. They're they allow for efficient data retrieval based on\nfor efficient data retrieval based on\nfor efficient data retrieval based on their unique keys. They're flexible and\ntheir unique keys. They're flexible and\ntheir unique keys. They're flexible and easy to implement, but there's a\neasy to implement, but there's a\neasy to implement, but there's a potential problem with them. See, it's a\npotential problem with them. See, it's a\npotential problem with them. See, it's a challenge to ensure that the data is a\nchallenge to ensure that the data is a\nchallenge to ensure that the data is a particular structure. And this could be\nparticular structure. And this could be\nparticular structure. And this could be a huge problem in larger projects. So to\na huge problem in larger projects. So to\na huge problem in larger projects. So to put things in simple words, it doesn't\nput things in simple words, it doesn't\nput things in simple words, it doesn't really check if the data is the correct\nreally check if the data is the correct\nreally check if the data is the correct type data type or structure and that\ntype data type or structure and that\ntype data type or structure and that could be the source of a lot of logical\ncould be the source of a lot of logical\ncould be the source of a lot of logical errors in your project. And if your\nerrors in your project. And if your\nerrors in your project. And if your project is really really large, then\nproject is really really large, then\nproject is really really large, then this could be quite a headache to\nthis could be quite a headache to\nthis could be quite a headache to identify, right? Cuz it's quite a small\nidentify, right? Cuz it's quite a small\nidentify, right? Cuz it's quite a small detail. So what is the solution for\ndetail. So what is the solution for\ndetail. So what is the solution for this? Well, it's something called a type\nthis? Well, it's something called a type\nthis? Well, it's something called a type dictionary. Now, here is an example on\ndictionary. Now, here is an example on\ndictionary. Now, here is an example on how you create a type dictionary in\nhow you create a type dictionary in\nhow you create a type dictionary in Python. And I just want to uh emphasize\nPython. And I just want to uh emphasize\nPython. And I just want to uh emphasize that this type annotation is used\nthat this type annotation is used\nthat this type annotation is used extensively in langraph. This will be\nextensively in langraph. This will be\nextensively in langraph. This will be used to define states. Now don't worry\nused to define states. Now don't worry\nused to define states. Now don't worry you we haven't covered states yet. We\nyou we haven't covered states yet. We\nyou we haven't covered states yet. We will cover that in the next section. But\nwill cover that in the next section. But\nwill cover that in the next section. But just be mindful that this is quite\njust be mindful that this is quite\njust be mindful that this is quite important. So a type dictionary is quite\nimportant. So a type dictionary is quite\nimportant. So a type dictionary is quite easy to implement. You implement it as a\neasy to implement. You implement it as a\neasy to implement. You implement it as a class. In this case, I've implemented\nclass. In this case, I've implemented\nclass. In this case, I've implemented the same um example I uh uh showed you\nthe same um example I uh uh showed you\nthe same um example I uh uh showed you in the previous section where I\nin the previous section where I\nin the previous section where I described the movie is the same exact\ndescribed the movie is the same exact\ndescribed the movie is the same exact keys and values. So, it still has the\nkeys and values. So, it still has the\nkeys and values. So, it still has the name and the year. But notice in this\nname and the year. But notice in this\nname and the year. But notice in this class, I have defined the actual uh data\nclass, I have defined the actual uh data\nclass, I have defined the actual uh data type of what that key should be. So, for\ntype of what that key should be. So, for\ntype of what that key should be. So, for example, the name is a string and the\nexample, the name is a string and the\nexample, the name is a string and the year is an integer, right? And to\nyear is an integer, right? And to\nyear is an integer, right? And to initialize a dictionary uh I have done\ninitialize a dictionary uh I have done\ninitialize a dictionary uh I have done the exact same thing. to have engineet\nthe exact same thing. to have engineet\nthe exact same thing. to have engineet game in 2019. So now there are two main\ngame in 2019. So now there are two main\ngame in 2019. So now there are two main uh benefits of using a type dictionary\nuh benefits of using a type dictionary\nuh benefits of using a type dictionary it's type safety because we've\nit's type safety because we've\nit's type safety because we've explicitly defined what should be in\nexplicitly defined what should be in\nexplicitly defined what should be in this data structure and so this will\nthis data structure and so this will\nthis data structure and so this will really reduce the runtime errors and\nreally reduce the runtime errors and\nreally reduce the runtime errors and obviously the readability is enhanced as\nobviously the readability is enhanced as\nobviously the readability is enhanced as well and this will make debugging easier\nwell and this will make debugging easier\nwell and this will make debugging easier if something goes wrong within this type\nif something goes wrong within this type\nif something goes wrong within this type dictionary. Cool. So we've covered type\ndictionary. Cool. So we've covered type\ndictionary. Cool. So we've covered type dictionary now. Now we move on to\ndictionary now. Now we move on to\ndictionary now. Now we move on to another type of annotation which is\nanother type of annotation which is\nanother type of annotation which is union. Now you might have seen these\nunion. Now you might have seen these\nunion. Now you might have seen these future these later uh types annotations\nfuture these later uh types annotations\nfuture these later uh types annotations before if you coded in Python but again\nbefore if you coded in Python but again\nbefore if you coded in Python but again I'm just giving you a highle overview\nI'm just giving you a highle overview\nI'm just giving you a highle overview what these are. So union take a look at\nwhat these are. So union take a look at\nwhat these are. So union take a look at this example. So I've created a very\nthis example. So I've created a very\nthis example. So I've created a very simple function which takes in a value\nsimple function which takes in a value\nsimple function which takes in a value and it squares it. Now in this case the\nand it squares it. Now in this case the\nand it squares it. Now in this case the uh input x could be either an integer or\nuh input x could be either an integer or\nuh input x could be either an integer or float and union basically says that\nfloat and union basically says that\nfloat and union basically says that whatever value you have can be these\nwhatever value you have can be these\nwhatever value you have can be these data types only. So in this case x can\ndata types only. So in this case x can\ndata types only. So in this case x can only be integer or float. So if I pass\nonly be integer or float. So if I pass\nonly be integer or float. So if I pass in five or 1.23 4 this would be\nin five or 1.23 4 this would be\nin five or 1.23 4 this would be completely fine. It would square the\ncompletely fine. It would square the\ncompletely fine. It would square the number and everything. But if I passed\nnumber and everything. But if I passed\nnumber and everything. But if I passed in a string like I am a string it would\nin a string like I am a string it would\nin a string like I am a string it would completely fail. Now admittedly yes this\ncompletely fail. Now admittedly yes this\ncompletely fail. Now admittedly yes this function is quite easy. If I passed in\nfunction is quite easy. If I passed in\nfunction is quite easy. If I passed in I'm a string, it would have failed\nI'm a string, it would have failed\nI'm a string, it would have failed anyway. But in more complicated\nanyway. But in more complicated\nanyway. But in more complicated applications, hopefully you can see how\napplications, hopefully you can see how\napplications, hopefully you can see how this actually is useful. In fact, the\nthis actually is useful. In fact, the\nthis actually is useful. In fact, the makers of Lang Chain and Langraph used\nmakers of Lang Chain and Langraph used\nmakers of Lang Chain and Langraph used Union quite extensively throughout u\nUnion quite extensively throughout u\nUnion quite extensively throughout u making the actual library. So again,\nmaking the actual library. So again,\nmaking the actual library. So again, it's flexible and it's easy to code and\nit's flexible and it's easy to code and\nit's flexible and it's easy to code and it allows for type safety. So because it\nit allows for type safety. So because it\nit allows for type safety. So because it can provide hints to uh help catch\ncan provide hints to uh help catch\ncan provide hints to uh help catch incorrect usage. Now something similar\nincorrect usage. Now something similar\nincorrect usage. Now something similar to union is another type annotation\nto union is another type annotation\nto union is another type annotation which is optional. Now optional is quite\nwhich is optional. Now optional is quite\nwhich is optional. Now optional is quite similar and in this case I've described\nsimilar and in this case I've described\nsimilar and in this case I've described another function nice message. So you\nanother function nice message. So you\nanother function nice message. So you pass in a name. If you pass in a name it\npass in a name. If you pass in a name it\npass in a name. If you pass in a name it will say hi there name. So for example\nwill say hi there name. So for example\nwill say hi there name. So for example let the name be Bob. If I pass in Bob to\nlet the name be Bob. If I pass in Bob to\nlet the name be Bob. If I pass in Bob to this uh function it would say hi there\nthis uh function it would say hi there\nthis uh function it would say hi there Bob. But what if I don't pass in\nBob. But what if I don't pass in\nBob. But what if I don't pass in anything? Now if I don't pass anything\nanything? Now if I don't pass anything\nanything? Now if I don't pass anything optional because I've used optional says\noptional because I've used optional says\noptional because I've used optional says that the name parameter could either be\nthat the name parameter could either be\nthat the name parameter could either be a string or a none value. Now if I pass\na string or a none value. Now if I pass\na string or a none value. Now if I pass in nothing it will go in this if\nin nothing it will go in this if\nin nothing it will go in this if statement and say hey random person. But\nstatement and say hey random person. But\nstatement and say hey random person. But this is also important to emphasize that\nthis is also important to emphasize that\nthis is also important to emphasize that it cannot be anything else. It can't be\nit cannot be anything else. It can't be\nit cannot be anything else. It can't be an integer or or a boolean or a float or\nan integer or or a boolean or a float or\nan integer or or a boolean or a float or anything like that. It has to be either\nanything like that. It has to be either\nanything like that. It has to be either a string or a none value because that's\na string or a none value because that's\na string or a none value because that's what I've defined here. Cool. Now comes\nwhat I've defined here. Cool. Now comes\nwhat I've defined here. Cool. Now comes another type annotation called any. And\nanother type annotation called any. And\nanother type annotation called any. And any is really the easiest one to\nany is really the easiest one to\nany is really the easiest one to understand. It literally means this\nunderstand. It literally means this\nunderstand. It literally means this value could be anything. It could be any\nvalue could be anything. It could be any\nvalue could be anything. It could be any data structure. So in this case I've\ndata structure. So in this case I've\ndata structure. So in this case I've created a simple um function called\ncreated a simple um function called\ncreated a simple um function called print value where it takes in something\nprint value where it takes in something\nprint value where it takes in something and it prints that. And for example I\nand it prints that. And for example I\nand it prints that. And for example I passed in this string and it prints it\npassed in this string and it prints it\npassed in this string and it prints it and anything and everything is allowed.\nand anything and everything is allowed.\nand anything and everything is allowed. Cool. one last type annotation I promise\nCool. one last type annotation I promise\nCool. one last type annotation I promise and it's the lambda function. So lambda\nand it's the lambda function. So lambda\nand it's the lambda function. So lambda functions are quite useful. For example,\nfunctions are quite useful. For example,\nfunctions are quite useful. For example, in this I'll give you two examples now.\nin this I'll give you two examples now.\nin this I'll give you two examples now. So the first example is this really\nSo the first example is this really\nSo the first example is this really simple uh example. Now we've already I\nsimple uh example. Now we've already I\nsimple uh example. Now we've already I already created a square function\nalready created a square function\nalready created a square function before, right? Where it takes in a\nbefore, right? Where it takes in a\nbefore, right? Where it takes in a value, it takes in a number and it\nvalue, it takes in a number and it\nvalue, it takes in a number and it squares it. So for example, if I passed\nsquares it. So for example, if I passed\nsquares it. So for example, if I passed in square 10, it would give me 100.\nin square 10, it would give me 100.\nin square 10, it would give me 100. Quite an easy example. Now let me give\nQuite an easy example. Now let me give\nQuite an easy example. Now let me give you a second\nyou a second\nyou a second example. this. So if you've come from a\nexample. this. So if you've come from a\nexample. this. So if you've come from a leaf code background, then you've\nleaf code background, then you've\nleaf code background, then you've probably seen you've either used lambda\nprobably seen you've either used lambda\nprobably seen you've either used lambda before and you've definitely used math\nbefore and you've definitely used math\nbefore and you've definitely used math before cuz it's quite efficient. So for\nbefore cuz it's quite efficient. So for\nbefore cuz it's quite efficient. So for example, if I pass in 1 2 3 4, what this\nexample, if I pass in 1 2 3 4, what this\nexample, if I pass in 1 2 3 4, what this piece of code is saying is that it\npiece of code is saying is that it\npiece of code is saying is that it squares each number in nums. So this map\nsquares each number in nums. So this map\nsquares each number in nums. So this map function maps each value uh and performs\nfunction maps each value uh and performs\nfunction maps each value uh and performs this function to it. So x * x. So 1 4 9\nthis function to it. So x * x. So 1 4 9\nthis function to it. So x * x. So 1 4 9 16 and then converts that back into a\n16 and then converts that back into a\n16 and then converts that back into a list. Now lambda functions really are\nlist. Now lambda functions really are\nlist. Now lambda functions really are just a shortcut to writing small\njust a shortcut to writing small\njust a shortcut to writing small functions and they make everything quite\nfunctions and they make everything quite\nfunctions and they make everything quite efficient. Now obviously this could have\nefficient. Now obviously this could have\nefficient. Now obviously this could have been done in one line as well but for\nbeen done in one line as well but for\nbeen done in one line as well but for example this a beginner programmer could\nexample this a beginner programmer could\nexample this a beginner programmer could have might have used a for loop but a\nhave might have used a for loop but a\nhave might have used a for loop but a more advanced programmer could have used\nmore advanced programmer could have used\nmore advanced programmer could have used this and this is obviously much more\nthis and this is obviously much more\nthis and this is obviously much more efficient. Right? So hopefully you can\nefficient. Right? So hopefully you can\nefficient. Right? So hopefully you can start to see what how powerful these\nstart to see what how powerful these\nstart to see what how powerful these type annotations are and these will be\ntype annotations are and these will be\ntype annotations are and these will be coming up. So again, no need to memorize\ncoming up. So again, no need to memorize\ncoming up. So again, no need to memorize this. Just need to have a highle\nthis. Just need to have a highle\nthis. Just need to have a highle overview what they are. Okay, cool. So\noverview what they are. Okay, cool. So\noverview what they are. Okay, cool. So now I'll see you in the next section.\nnow I'll see you in the next section.\nnow I'll see you in the next section. See you\nSee you\nSee you there. All right, perfect. So let's\nthere. All right, perfect. So let's\nthere. All right, perfect. So let's continue on. In this section, we will\ncontinue on. In this section, we will\ncontinue on. In this section, we will look at the different elements in\nlook at the different elements in\nlook at the different elements in Langraph. So let's begin with our first\nLangraph. So let's begin with our first\nLangraph. So let's begin with our first element, one of the most fundamental\nelement, one of the most fundamental\nelement, one of the most fundamental elements in all of Langraph, the state.\nelements in all of Langraph, the state.\nelements in all of Langraph, the state. So what is a state? Well, it's a shared\nSo what is a state? Well, it's a shared\nSo what is a state? Well, it's a shared data structure that holds the current\ndata structure that holds the current\ndata structure that holds the current information or context of the entire\ninformation or context of the entire\ninformation or context of the entire application. In simpler terms, it is\napplication. In simpler terms, it is\napplication. In simpler terms, it is like the application's memory where it\nlike the application's memory where it\nlike the application's memory where it keeps track of the variables, the data\nkeeps track of the variables, the data\nkeeps track of the variables, the data that nodes can access and modify as they\nthat nodes can access and modify as they\nthat nodes can access and modify as they execute. Now, don't worry if you don't\nexecute. Now, don't worry if you don't\nexecute. Now, don't worry if you don't understand what a node is yet. That is\nunderstand what a node is yet. That is\nunderstand what a node is yet. That is what we will be talking in the next\nwhat we will be talking in the next\nwhat we will be talking in the next slide about. But as a good analogy,\nslide about. But as a good analogy,\nslide about. But as a good analogy, think of the whiteboard in a meeting\nthink of the whiteboard in a meeting\nthink of the whiteboard in a meeting room analogy.\nroom analogy.\nroom analogy. Now imagine you're in a meeting room and\nNow imagine you're in a meeting room and\nNow imagine you're in a meeting room and there are different participants as well\nthere are different participants as well\nthere are different participants as well and every time you come up with\nand every time you come up with\nand every time you come up with something new or you want to record some\nsomething new or you want to record some\nsomething new or you want to record some new uh information or update some\nnew uh information or update some\nnew uh information or update some information you write it on the\ninformation you write it on the\ninformation you write it on the whiteboard. In this case the whiteboard\nwhiteboard. In this case the whiteboard\nwhiteboard. In this case the whiteboard acts as your state and the participants\nacts as your state and the participants\nacts as your state and the participants act as a\nact as a\nact as a node. So the state shows us the updated\nnode. So the state shows us the updated\nnode. So the state shows us the updated content/in information of your entire\ncontent/in information of your entire\ncontent/in information of your entire application. Hopefully that made a bit\napplication. Hopefully that made a bit\napplication. Hopefully that made a bit of sense.\nof sense.\nof sense. So let's move on to the node another\nSo let's move on to the node another\nSo let's move on to the node another fundamental element in lang graph. So\nfundamental element in lang graph. So\nfundamental element in lang graph. So these are just individual functions or\nthese are just individual functions or\nthese are just individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks\noperations that perform specific tasks\noperations that perform specific tasks within the graph. So each of these node\nwithin the graph. So each of these node\nwithin the graph. So each of these node receives an input which is often just\nreceives an input which is often just\nreceives an input which is often just the current state of your application.\nthe current state of your application.\nthe current state of your application. It processes it and then produces an\nIt processes it and then produces an\nIt processes it and then produces an output or an updated\noutput or an updated\noutput or an updated state. So here's a good analogy of this.\nstate. So here's a good analogy of this.\nstate. So here's a good analogy of this. The assembly line station analogy. Now\nThe assembly line station analogy. Now\nThe assembly line station analogy. Now look at this image. Each of these\nlook at this image. Each of these\nlook at this image. Each of these station does one specific job. It could\nstation does one specific job. It could\nstation does one specific job. It could be attaching a part. It could be\nbe attaching a part. It could be\nbe attaching a part. It could be painting it. It could be inspecting the\npainting it. It could be inspecting the\npainting it. It could be inspecting the quality and so on and so on. The point\nquality and so on and so on. The point\nquality and so on and so on. The point is each of these stations represent a\nis each of these stations represent a\nis each of these stations represent a node because they do one specific\nnode because they do one specific\nnode because they do one specific task. So how do you actually connect\ntask. So how do you actually connect\ntask. So how do you actually connect these different nodes together? Well,\nthese different nodes together? Well,\nthese different nodes together? Well, before we go into that, I think it's\nbefore we go into that, I think it's\nbefore we go into that, I think it's important we understand the most\nimportant we understand the most\nimportant we understand the most important element of them all, the\nimportant element of them all, the\nimportant element of them all, the graph. It is so important that it's even\ngraph. It is so important that it's even\ngraph. It is so important that it's even in the name Langraph. So, the graph is\nin the name Langraph. So, the graph is\nin the name Langraph. So, the graph is just the overarching structure and it\njust the overarching structure and it\njust the overarching structure and it maps out how different tasks aka nodes\nmaps out how different tasks aka nodes\nmaps out how different tasks aka nodes are connected and executed. So it\nare connected and executed. So it\nare connected and executed. So it visually represents the workflow showing\nvisually represents the workflow showing\nvisually represents the workflow showing the sequence and the conditional parts\nthe sequence and the conditional parts\nthe sequence and the conditional parts between various\nbetween various\nbetween various operations. Now a graph is quite\noperations. Now a graph is quite\noperations. Now a graph is quite self-explanatory but you can think of it\nself-explanatory but you can think of it\nself-explanatory but you can think of it as a road map. On a road map you can see\nas a road map. On a road map you can see\nas a road map. On a road map you can see it display the different routes\nit display the different routes\nit display the different routes connecting cities with the different\nconnecting cities with the different\nconnecting cities with the different intersections offering choices on which\nintersections offering choices on which\nintersections offering choices on which path to take next.\npath to take next.\npath to take next. Now, here's a great image of what a\nNow, here's a great image of what a\nNow, here's a great image of what a graph is, and these are the individual\ngraph is, and these are the individual\ngraph is, and these are the individual nodes, but you'll see they're connected\nnodes, but you'll see they're connected\nnodes, but you'll see they're connected somehow. So, how are these connected?\nsomehow. So, how are these connected?\nsomehow. So, how are these connected? That brings us to the next element,\nThat brings us to the next element,\nThat brings us to the next element, edges. So, edges are just the connection\nedges. So, edges are just the connection\nedges. So, edges are just the connection between nodes and these determine the\nbetween nodes and these determine the\nbetween nodes and these determine the flow of\nflow of\nflow of execution. So, they tell us or tell the\nexecution. So, they tell us or tell the\nexecution. So, they tell us or tell the application which node should be\napplication which node should be\napplication which node should be executed next after the current one\nexecuted next after the current one\nexecuted next after the current one completes its task. A really good\ncompletes its task. A really good\ncompletes its task. A really good analogy of this is imagining a train\nanalogy of this is imagining a train\nanalogy of this is imagining a train track. So this is the train track and\ntrack. So this is the train track and\ntrack. So this is the train track and think of it as an edge and think of it\nthink of it as an edge and think of it\nthink of it as an edge and think of it as connecting two stations one here and\nas connecting two stations one here and\nas connecting two stations one here and one here which represent nodes together\none here which represent nodes together\none here which represent nodes together in a specific\nin a specific\nin a specific direction. Now the train which will go\ndirection. Now the train which will go\ndirection. Now the train which will go on the train track that acts as your\non the train track that acts as your\non the train track that acts as your state. So the state gets updated from\nstate. So the state gets updated from\nstate. So the state gets updated from one station to another.\none station to another.\none station to another. But there is another type of an edge and\nBut there is another type of an edge and\nBut there is another type of an edge and it's called a conditional\nit's called a conditional\nit's called a conditional edge. So this is still not very\nedge. So this is still not very\nedge. So this is still not very complicated. It's quite simple to\ncomplicated. It's quite simple to\ncomplicated. It's quite simple to understand. These are just specialized\nunderstand. These are just specialized\nunderstand. These are just specialized connections that decide the next node to\nconnections that decide the next node to\nconnections that decide the next node to be executed based on the specific\nbe executed based on the specific\nbe executed based on the specific condition or logic applied to the\ncondition or logic applied to the\ncondition or logic applied to the current state. Now a really good analogy\ncurrent state. Now a really good analogy\ncurrent state. Now a really good analogy for this is the traffic light analogy.\nfor this is the traffic light analogy.\nfor this is the traffic light analogy. So green could mean to go one way, red\nSo green could mean to go one way, red\nSo green could mean to go one way, red could mean to stop. yellow could mean to\ncould mean to stop. yellow could mean to\ncould mean to stop. yellow could mean to slow down. The point I'm trying to make\nslow down. The point I'm trying to make\nslow down. The point I'm trying to make here is that the condition, in this case\nhere is that the condition, in this case\nhere is that the condition, in this case the light color, it decides the next\nthe light color, it decides the next\nthe light color, it decides the next step. If you want to think even more\nstep. If you want to think even more\nstep. If you want to think even more simply, you could think about an if else\nsimply, you could think about an if else\nsimply, you could think about an if else statement. So that being said, we move\nstatement. So that being said, we move\nstatement. So that being said, we move on to the next element, the start point.\non to the next element, the start point.\non to the next element, the start point. So the start point or the node, the\nSo the start point or the node, the\nSo the start point or the node, the start node is a virtual entry point in\nstart node is a virtual entry point in\nstart node is a virtual entry point in langraph and this marks where the\nlangraph and this marks where the\nlangraph and this marks where the workflow begins. Now it's important to\nworkflow begins. Now it's important to\nworkflow begins. Now it's important to note that it doesn't perform any\nnote that it doesn't perform any\nnote that it doesn't perform any operations itself but it serves as the\noperations itself but it serves as the\noperations itself but it serves as the designated starting position for the\ndesignated starting position for the\ndesignated starting position for the graph's\ngraph's\ngraph's execution. Now in terms of analogy it is\nexecution. Now in terms of analogy it is\nexecution. Now in terms of analogy it is quite simple to understand but if you\nquite simple to understand but if you\nquite simple to understand but if you really want think of it as the starting\nreally want think of it as the starting\nreally want think of it as the starting line of\nline of\nline of race. Now if you have a start point well\nrace. Now if you have a start point well\nrace. Now if you have a start point well you need an end point as well and that's\nyou need an end point as well and that's\nyou need an end point as well and that's where the end element comes in. So the\nwhere the end element comes in. So the\nwhere the end element comes in. So the end nodes just signifies the conclusion\nend nodes just signifies the conclusion\nend nodes just signifies the conclusion of the workflow in Langraph. So when the\nof the workflow in Langraph. So when the\nof the workflow in Langraph. So when the application reaches this node, the\napplication reaches this node, the\napplication reaches this node, the graph's execution completely stops and\ngraph's execution completely stops and\ngraph's execution completely stops and it indicates that all intended processes\nit indicates that all intended processes\nit indicates that all intended processes have been\nhave been\nhave been completed. And again, a good analogy for\ncompleted. And again, a good analogy for\ncompleted. And again, a good analogy for this is just the finish line in a\nthis is just the finish line in a\nthis is just the finish line in a race. So nothing too hard yet. But now\nrace. So nothing too hard yet. But now\nrace. So nothing too hard yet. But now let's look at\nlet's look at\nlet's look at tools. So tools are specialized\ntools. So tools are specialized\ntools. So tools are specialized functions or utilities that nodes can\nfunctions or utilities that nodes can\nfunctions or utilities that nodes can utilize to perform specific tasks. For\nutilize to perform specific tasks. For\nutilize to perform specific tasks. For example, it could be fetching data from\nexample, it could be fetching data from\nexample, it could be fetching data from an\nan\nan API. They basically enhance the\nAPI. They basically enhance the\nAPI. They basically enhance the capabilities of these nodes by providing\ncapabilities of these nodes by providing\ncapabilities of these nodes by providing additional\nadditional\nadditional functionalities. Now, one common\nfunctionalities. Now, one common\nfunctionalities. Now, one common question could be, well, what's the\nquestion could be, well, what's the\nquestion could be, well, what's the difference between a tool and a node?\ndifference between a tool and a node?\ndifference between a tool and a node? The node is just the part of the graph\nThe node is just the part of the graph\nThe node is just the part of the graph structure. Whereas the tools, these guys\nstructure. Whereas the tools, these guys\nstructure. Whereas the tools, these guys are functionalities used within the\nare functionalities used within the\nare functionalities used within the nodes. Now, a really good analogy for\nnodes. Now, a really good analogy for\nnodes. Now, a really good analogy for this is just tools in a toolbox. So\nthis is just tools in a toolbox. So\nthis is just tools in a toolbox. So imagine a hammer for the nails, a\nimagine a hammer for the nails, a\nimagine a hammer for the nails, a screwdriver for the screws, etc. The\nscrewdriver for the screws, etc. The\nscrewdriver for the screws, etc. The point is each tool has a distinct\npoint is each tool has a distinct\npoint is each tool has a distinct purpose. Again, don't worry. You will\npurpose. Again, don't worry. You will\npurpose. Again, don't worry. You will understand the differentiation between\nunderstand the differentiation between\nunderstand the differentiation between tools and nodes in a lot more detail\ntools and nodes in a lot more detail\ntools and nodes in a lot more detail later when we code this, but this is\nlater when we code this, but this is\nlater when we code this, but this is just for a general\njust for a general\njust for a general overview. Now, another question you\noverview. Now, another question you\noverview. Now, another question you could be asking is, is there a middleman\ncould be asking is, is there a middleman\ncould be asking is, is there a middleman between a tool and a node? Short answer\nbetween a tool and a node? Short answer\nbetween a tool and a node? Short answer is yes. That's where tool node comes in.\nis yes. That's where tool node comes in.\nis yes. That's where tool node comes in. So a tool node is just a special kind of\nSo a tool node is just a special kind of\nSo a tool node is just a special kind of a node whose main job is to run a\na node whose main job is to run a\na node whose main job is to run a tool. So for example, a tool node could\ntool. So for example, a tool node could\ntool. So for example, a tool node could be a node where its only job is to use a\nbe a node where its only job is to use a\nbe a node where its only job is to use a tool and that tool's job is to fetch\ntool and that tool's job is to fetch\ntool and that tool's job is to fetch some data from an\nsome data from an\nsome data from an API. So it connects the tools output\nAPI. So it connects the tools output\nAPI. So it connects the tools output back into the state so other nodes can\nback into the state so other nodes can\nback into the state so other nodes can use that information.\nuse that information.\nuse that information. So think about this analogy going back\nSo think about this analogy going back\nSo think about this analogy going back to the assembly line. In this case,\nto the assembly line. In this case,\nto the assembly line. In this case, imagine the operator as the tool node\nimagine the operator as the tool node\nimagine the operator as the tool node and it controls the machine which is the\nand it controls the machine which is the\nand it controls the machine which is the tool and then sends all of these results\ntool and then sends all of these results\ntool and then sends all of these results back into this assembly\nback into this assembly\nback into this assembly line. Now if we progress further, let's\nline. Now if we progress further, let's\nline. Now if we progress further, let's look at the state graph. So this is\nlook at the state graph. So this is\nlook at the state graph. So this is quite an important element as well. This\nquite an important element as well. This\nquite an important element as well. This will be one of the first elements you\nwill be one of the first elements you\nwill be one of the first elements you actually interact with and its main\nactually interact with and its main\nactually interact with and its main purpose is to build and compile the\npurpose is to build and compile the\npurpose is to build and compile the graph structure. So it's quite\ngraph structure. So it's quite\ngraph structure. So it's quite important. It manages the nodes, the\nimportant. It manages the nodes, the\nimportant. It manages the nodes, the edges, the overall state and it makes\nedges, the overall state and it makes\nedges, the overall state and it makes sure that the workflow operates in a\nsure that the workflow operates in a\nsure that the workflow operates in a unified way and all of the data flows\nunified way and all of the data flows\nunified way and all of the data flows correctly between components. So again\ncorrectly between components. So again\ncorrectly between components. So again it's quite an important element. You can\nit's quite an important element. You can\nit's quite an important element. You can think about it as a blueprint of a\nthink about it as a blueprint of a\nthink about it as a blueprint of a building. So just as a blueprint\nbuilding. So just as a blueprint\nbuilding. So just as a blueprint outlines the design and the connections\noutlines the design and the connections\noutlines the design and the connections within a building, the state graph does\nwithin a building, the state graph does\nwithin a building, the state graph does exactly that, but it just defines the\nexactly that, but it just defines the\nexactly that, but it just defines the structure and the flow of your workflow\nstructure and the flow of your workflow\nstructure and the flow of your workflow or\napplication. Now here's where the\napplication. Now here's where the runnable comes in. Now some of you will\nrunnable comes in. Now some of you will\nrunnable comes in. Now some of you will be coming from a lang chain background\nbe coming from a lang chain background\nbe coming from a lang chain background and runnable is quite common there and\nand runnable is quite common there and\nand runnable is quite common there and it's quite similar in langraph as well.\nit's quite similar in langraph as well.\nit's quite similar in langraph as well. A runnable in langraph is just the\nA runnable in langraph is just the\nA runnable in langraph is just the standardized executable component that\nstandardized executable component that\nstandardized executable component that performs a specific task within an AI\nperforms a specific task within an AI\nperforms a specific task within an AI workflow. It basically acts as a\nworkflow. It basically acts as a\nworkflow. It basically acts as a fundamental building block allowing for\nfundamental building block allowing for\nfundamental building block allowing for us to create these modular\nus to create these modular\nus to create these modular systems. Now a question you could have\nsystems. Now a question you could have\nsystems. Now a question you could have right now is well what's the difference\nright now is well what's the difference\nright now is well what's the difference between a runnable and a node?\nbetween a runnable and a node?\nbetween a runnable and a node? Short answer is a runnable can represent\nShort answer is a runnable can represent\nShort answer is a runnable can represent various operations whereas a node in\nvarious operations whereas a node in\nvarious operations whereas a node in lang lang graph typically receives a\nlang lang graph typically receives a\nlang lang graph typically receives a state performs an action on them and\nstate performs an action on them and\nstate performs an action on them and then updates the state. Now don't worry\nthen updates the state. Now don't worry\nthen updates the state. Now don't worry if you didn't 100% get that when we go\nif you didn't 100% get that when we go\nif you didn't 100% get that when we go into the coding section you will get it\ninto the coding section you will get it\ninto the coding section you will get it a lot better. But a good analogy is a\na lot better. But a good analogy is a\na lot better. But a good analogy is a Lego brick. So just as how Lego bricks\nLego brick. So just as how Lego bricks\nLego brick. So just as how Lego bricks can be snapped together to build these\ncan be snapped together to build these\ncan be snapped together to build these complicated structures, runnables can be\ncomplicated structures, runnables can be\ncomplicated structures, runnables can be combined to create sophisticated AI\ncombined to create sophisticated AI\ncombined to create sophisticated AI workflows. So now let's move on to the\nworkflows. So now let's move on to the\nworkflows. So now let's move on to the different types of\ndifferent types of\ndifferent types of messages. Now again, if you come from a\nmessages. Now again, if you come from a\nmessages. Now again, if you come from a lang chain background, you'll be quite\nlang chain background, you'll be quite\nlang chain background, you'll be quite familiar with these. If you haven't,\nfamiliar with these. If you haven't,\nfamiliar with these. If you haven't, don't worry. We will look at the five\ndon't worry. We will look at the five\ndon't worry. We will look at the five most common message types in Langraph.\nmost common message types in Langraph.\nmost common message types in Langraph. So to start off, there's the human\nSo to start off, there's the human\nSo to start off, there's the human message which represents the input from\nmessage which represents the input from\nmessage which represents the input from a user. The AI message which represents\na user. The AI message which represents\na user. The AI message which represents responses generated by AI models. The\nresponses generated by AI models. The\nresponses generated by AI models. The system message which is used to provide\nsystem message which is used to provide\nsystem message which is used to provide instructions or context to the\ninstructions or context to the\ninstructions or context to the model. Tool message which is similar to\nmodel. Tool message which is similar to\nmodel. Tool message which is similar to the function message but specific to\nthe function message but specific to\nthe function message but specific to tool usage. And the function message\ntool usage. And the function message\ntool usage. And the function message represents the tool of a function call.\nrepresents the tool of a function call.\nrepresents the tool of a function call. If you've used an API like a large\nIf you've used an API like a large\nIf you've used an API like a large language model API before, such as\nlanguage model API before, such as\nlanguage model API before, such as OpenAI's API, a lot of these will be\nOpenAI's API, a lot of these will be\nOpenAI's API, a lot of these will be quite familiar, especially the system\nquite familiar, especially the system\nquite familiar, especially the system message, the AI message, and the human\nmessage, the AI message, and the human\nmessage, the AI message, and the human message. And that concludes this\nmessage. And that concludes this\nmessage. And that concludes this section. So, I will see you in the next\nsection. So, I will see you in the next\nsection. So, I will see you in the next section. Awesome. So, now this is quite\nsection. Awesome. So, now this is quite\nsection. Awesome. So, now this is quite exciting. We're actually about to start\nexciting. We're actually about to start\nexciting. We're actually about to start coding in Langra for the very first\ncoding in Langra for the very first\ncoding in Langra for the very first time. Now that we've covered all the\ntime. Now that we've covered all the\ntime. Now that we've covered all the theory, admittedly the boring section,\ntheory, admittedly the boring section,\ntheory, admittedly the boring section, we're now actually going to code up some\nwe're now actually going to code up some\nwe're now actually going to code up some graphs. And we're about to code up our\ngraphs. And we're about to code up our\ngraphs. And we're about to code up our very first graph in this sub section.\nvery first graph in this sub section.\nvery first graph in this sub section. But um for this overall section, I have\nBut um for this overall section, I have\nBut um for this overall section, I have a slight confession to make, which is\na slight confession to make, which is\na slight confession to make, which is we're not going to be building any AI\nwe're not going to be building any AI\nwe're not going to be building any AI agents in this\nagents in this\nagents in this section. Why? because I thought that one\nsection. Why? because I thought that one\nsection. Why? because I thought that one we haven't really even seen uh how to\nwe haven't really even seen uh how to\nwe haven't really even seen uh how to actually code in Langraph and combining\nactually code in Langraph and combining\nactually code in Langraph and combining all of these LLMs APIs and tools and all\nall of these LLMs APIs and tools and all\nall of these LLMs APIs and tools and all of that stuff which comes with it\nof that stuff which comes with it\nof that stuff which comes with it combining them together would be quite\ncombining them together would be quite\ncombining them together would be quite messy and it could be quite confusing at\nmessy and it could be quite confusing at\nmessy and it could be quite confusing at times especially the fact that we have\ntimes especially the fact that we have\ntimes especially the fact that we have never coded in Langraph before again\nnever coded in Langraph before again\nnever coded in Langraph before again like I said at the beginning of the\nlike I said at the beginning of the\nlike I said at the beginning of the course this course is supposed to be\ncourse this course is supposed to be\ncourse this course is supposed to be beginner friendly detailed and\nbeginner friendly detailed and\nbeginner friendly detailed and comprehensive and we're going to go in\ncomprehensive and we're going to go in\ncomprehensive and we're going to go in steps like little by little so hopefully\nsteps like little by little so hopefully\nsteps like little by little so hopefully understand but don't worry we will be\nunderstand but don't worry we will be\nunderstand but don't worry we will be coding AI agents soon we're just going\ncoding AI agents soon we're just going\ncoding AI agents soon we're just going to be building a couple of graphs right\nto be building a couple of graphs right\nto be building a couple of graphs right now uh understand lang graph better the\nnow uh understand lang graph better the\nnow uh understand lang graph better the syntax better and how to actually code\nsyntax better and how to actually code\nsyntax better and how to actually code up graphs and get confident with it and\nup graphs and get confident with it and\nup graphs and get confident with it and then we will actually build AI agents\nthen we will actually build AI agents\nthen we will actually build AI agents okay cool so what is the graph which\nokay cool so what is the graph which\nokay cool so what is the graph which we're going to be building together in\nwe're going to be building together in\nwe're going to be building together in this section I call it the uh hello\nthis section I call it the uh hello\nthis section I call it the uh hello world graph mainly because it's the most\nworld graph mainly because it's the most\nworld graph mainly because it's the most basic form of graph we can actually code\nbasic form of graph we can actually code\nbasic form of graph we can actually code in lang graph so the objectives are\nin lang graph so the objectives are\nin lang graph so the objectives are these\nthese\nthese So we're going to be understanding and\nSo we're going to be understanding and\nSo we're going to be understanding and defining the agent state structure and\ndefining the agent state structure and\ndefining the agent state structure and don't worry you'll understand what that\ndon't worry you'll understand what that\ndon't worry you'll understand what that is in a few minutes and we're going to\nis in a few minutes and we're going to\nis in a few minutes and we're going to be creating simple node functions nodes\nbe creating simple node functions nodes\nbe creating simple node functions nodes like we discussed in the previous\nlike we discussed in the previous\nlike we discussed in the previous section uh and we're going to be\nsection uh and we're going to be\nsection uh and we're going to be processing them and updating the state.\nprocessing them and updating the state.\nprocessing them and updating the state. We're going to be building the first\nWe're going to be building the first\nWe're going to be building the first ever basic langraph structure and we\never basic langraph structure and we\never basic langraph structure and we will understand how to compile it,\nwill understand how to compile it,\nwill understand how to compile it, invoke it, process it, everything. And\ninvoke it, process it, everything. And\ninvoke it, process it, everything. And really the main goal of this section is\nreally the main goal of this section is\nreally the main goal of this section is to really understand how data flows\nto really understand how data flows\nto really understand how data flows through a single node in langraph. Now\nthrough a single node in langraph. Now\nthrough a single node in langraph. Now just to give you a bit of a heads up as\njust to give you a bit of a heads up as\njust to give you a bit of a heads up as to what we'll actually be covering uh\nto what we'll actually be covering uh\nto what we'll actually be covering uh what we're going to be building I should\nwhat we're going to be building I should\nwhat we're going to be building I should say is this graph. Again like I said\nsay is this graph. Again like I said\nsay is this graph. Again like I said this is the most basic form of graph you\nthis is the most basic form of graph you\nthis is the most basic form of graph you can build in langraph. It has a start\ncan build in langraph. It has a start\ncan build in langraph. It has a start point and an end point and this node\npoint and an end point and this node\npoint and an end point and this node sandwiched in between them. All right\nsandwiched in between them. All right\nsandwiched in between them. All right cool. So hopefully you've understood\ncool. So hopefully you've understood\ncool. So hopefully you've understood what the objectives are. It's quite\nwhat the objectives are. It's quite\nwhat the objectives are. It's quite basic and yeah, I'll see you at the\ncode. Okay, cool. Now let's actually\ncode. Okay, cool. Now let's actually code this very first graph. So I've\ncode this very first graph. So I've\ncode this very first graph. So I've imported three main things here. The\nimported three main things here. The\nimported three main things here. The dict, the type dict and the state graph.\ndict, the type dict and the state graph.\ndict, the type dict and the state graph. The dict and type dict is obviously\nThe dict and type dict is obviously\nThe dict and type dict is obviously dictionary and type dictionary but um\ndictionary and type dictionary but um\ndictionary and type dictionary but um and state graph. These three are\nand state graph. These three are\nand state graph. These three are elements which we covered in the\nelements which we covered in the\nelements which we covered in the previous section. So I would highly\nprevious section. So I would highly\nprevious section. So I would highly recommend you going back there if these\nrecommend you going back there if these\nrecommend you going back there if these are completely unfamiliar. But again you\nare completely unfamiliar. But again you\nare completely unfamiliar. But again you don't need to memorize what these are.\ndon't need to memorize what these are.\ndon't need to memorize what these are. Okay. But just to refresh your memory\nOkay. But just to refresh your memory\nOkay. But just to refresh your memory I've written in the comment here what\nI've written in the comment here what\nI've written in the comment here what the state graph is. So think of the\nthe state graph is. So think of the\nthe state graph is. So think of the state graph as a framework that helps\nstate graph as a framework that helps\nstate graph as a framework that helps you design and manage the flow of the\nyou design and manage the flow of the\nyou design and manage the flow of the tasks in your application. Um again that\ntasks in your application. Um again that\ntasks in your application. Um again that might sound a bit complicated but it's\nmight sound a bit complicated but it's\nmight sound a bit complicated but it's not. Once we actually start coding you\nnot. Once we actually start coding you\nnot. Once we actually start coding you will it'll make more sense. So now the\nwill it'll make more sense. So now the\nwill it'll make more sense. So now the first thing we're going to do after\nfirst thing we're going to do after\nfirst thing we're going to do after importing everything is create the state\nimporting everything is create the state\nimporting everything is create the state of our agent and let's call it agent\nof our agent and let's call it agent\nof our agent and let's call it agent state. And just to refresh your memory\nstate. And just to refresh your memory\nstate. And just to refresh your memory again what the state is. Think of the\nagain what the state is. Think of the\nagain what the state is. Think of the state as a shared data structure. And\nstate as a shared data structure. And\nstate as a shared data structure. And this keeps track of the your all of the\nthis keeps track of the your all of the\nthis keeps track of the your all of the information as the application runs. All\ninformation as the application runs. All\ninformation as the application runs. All right cool. So now let's build the agent\nright cool. So now let's build the agent\nright cool. So now let's build the agent state. And the way we do this in\nstate. And the way we do this in\nstate. And the way we do this in Langraph is through a class. So let's\nLangraph is through a class. So let's\nLangraph is through a class. So let's build class agent state and in this in\nbuild class agent state and in this in\nbuild class agent state and in this in these parenthesis we will try to the the\nthese parenthesis we will try to the the\nthese parenthesis we will try to the the state needs to be in the form of a typed\nstate needs to be in the form of a typed\nstate needs to be in the form of a typed dictionary. So that's why we specify\ndictionary. So that's why we specify\ndictionary. So that's why we specify type dictionary here. Now let's keep\ntype dictionary here. Now let's keep\ntype dictionary here. Now let's keep this very very fundamental and basic.\nthis very very fundamental and basic.\nthis very very fundamental and basic. Let's just pass in one input. Let's call\nLet's just pass in one input. Let's call\nLet's just pass in one input. Let's call it something like\nit something like\nit something like message and obviously we put colon and\nmessage and obviously we put colon and\nmessage and obviously we put colon and the we specify the data type of that uh\nthe we specify the data type of that uh\nthe we specify the data type of that uh attribute. Now obviously the data type\nattribute. Now obviously the data type\nattribute. Now obviously the data type of message will be string right so\nof message will be string right so\nof message will be string right so that's why we specify strl again this is\nthat's why we specify strl again this is\nthat's why we specify strl again this is just normal python so once we've done\njust normal python so once we've done\njust normal python so once we've done that we are now going to be coding our\nthat we are now going to be coding our\nthat we are now going to be coding our very first node again another very\nvery first node again another very\nvery first node again another very fundamental element in langraph so how\nfundamental element in langraph so how\nfundamental element in langraph so how do we actually define a node it's quite\ndo we actually define a node it's quite\ndo we actually define a node it's quite simple it's just a normal standard\nsimple it's just a normal standard\nsimple it's just a normal standard python function and this is how you do\npython function and this is how you do\npython function and this is how you do it so let's say let's first try to find\nit so let's say let's first try to find\nit so let's say let's first try to find The objective um let's say we are trying\nThe objective um let's say we are trying\nThe objective um let's say we are trying to let's a greeting message a simple\nto let's a greeting message a simple\nto let's a greeting message a simple greeting message. So we'll write def\ngreeting message. So we'll write def\ngreeting message. So we'll write def greeting node and we need to pass in an\ngreeting node and we need to pass in an\ngreeting node and we need to pass in an input and pass what the output type\ninput and pass what the output type\ninput and pass what the output type should be. Now the input type of a node\nshould be. Now the input type of a node\nshould be. Now the input type of a node needs to be the state and the output\nneeds to be the state and the output\nneeds to be the state and the output type also has to be the state because\ntype also has to be the state because\ntype also has to be the state because remember the state keeps track of all of\nremember the state keeps track of all of\nremember the state keeps track of all of the information in your application\nthe information in your application\nthe information in your application right so obviously you need to pass that\nright so obviously you need to pass that\nright so obviously you need to pass that as an input and you need to pass out the\nas an input and you need to pass out the\nas an input and you need to pass out the or return the updated state. So here's\nor return the updated state. So here's\nor return the updated state. So here's how you do it. You pass in state and\nhow you do it. You pass in state and\nhow you do it. You pass in state and what is the state of our application?\nwhat is the state of our application?\nwhat is the state of our application? Well, it's the agent state which we\nWell, it's the agent state which we\nWell, it's the agent state which we defined earlier, right? And the output\ndefined earlier, right? And the output\ndefined earlier, right? And the output is going to be agent state cuz we need\nis going to be agent state cuz we need\nis going to be agent state cuz we need to output the updated state. And our\nto output the updated state. And our\nto output the updated state. And our updated state will again just be the\nupdated state will again just be the\nupdated state will again just be the agent state once we've done all of the\nagent state once we've done all of the\nagent state once we've done all of the um all of the mechanics we do in this\num all of the mechanics we do in this\num all of the mechanics we do in this function, the actions we perform in this\nfunction, the actions we perform in this\nfunction, the actions we perform in this function. All right. Okay. So now we\nfunction. All right. Okay. So now we\nfunction. All right. Okay. So now we need to do something very very important\nneed to do something very very important\nneed to do something very very important and it gets annoying sometimes but um\nand it gets annoying sometimes but um\nand it gets annoying sometimes but um it's really a key habit which I want you\nit's really a key habit which I want you\nit's really a key habit which I want you to form and it is dog strings. Now dock\nto form and it is dog strings. Now dock\nto form and it is dog strings. Now dock strings and lang graph is quite\nstrings and lang graph is quite\nstrings and lang graph is quite important. Why? Because dock strings is\nimportant. Why? Because dock strings is\nimportant. Why? Because dock strings is what will tell your AI agents when we\nwhat will tell your AI agents when we\nwhat will tell your AI agents when we actually build the AI agents your LLMs\nactually build the AI agents your LLMs\nactually build the AI agents your LLMs what that function actually does what\nwhat that function actually does what\nwhat that function actually does what that function's actions are what it\nthat function's actions are what it\nthat function's actions are what it performs. So in this case uh by the way\nperforms. So in this case uh by the way\nperforms. So in this case uh by the way to create a dock string is just three\nto create a dock string is just three\nto create a dock string is just three quotation marks three pairs of quotation\nquotation marks three pairs of quotation\nquotation marks three pairs of quotation marks. Uh let's call the dock string in\nmarks. Uh let's call the dock string in\nmarks. Uh let's call the dock string in this case let's just write simple node\nthis case let's just write simple node\nthis case let's just write simple node that adds a greeting message\nthat adds a greeting message\nthat adds a greeting message to the state. Perfect. So now how do we\nto the state. Perfect. So now how do we\nto the state. Perfect. So now how do we actually refer to this message? Well\nactually refer to this message? Well\nactually refer to this message? Well again this is just normal Python code.\nagain this is just normal Python code.\nagain this is just normal Python code. So we will pass in state and we will\nSo we will pass in state and we will\nSo we will pass in state and we will type in message.\nNow this specific part allows us to\nNow this specific part allows us to actually update the state or the message\nactually update the state or the message\nactually update the state or the message part of the state. And let's say let's\npart of the state. And let's say let's\npart of the state. And let's say let's come up with something like hey\ncome up with something like hey\ncome up with something like hey plus state\nplus state\nplus state message. Um we can also add something\nmessage. Um we can also add something\nmessage. Um we can also add something like how is your day going something\nlike how is your day going something\nlike how is your day going something basic. Now what's the last thing which I\nbasic. Now what's the last thing which I\nbasic. Now what's the last thing which I need to do in this function? Think about\nit. Okay. So now remember in uh a few\nit. Okay. So now remember in uh a few moments ago I said we have to return the\nmoments ago I said we have to return the\nmoments ago I said we have to return the state or the updated state. Well the\nstate or the updated state. Well the\nstate or the updated state. Well the updated state we've already done we've\nupdated state we've already done we've\nupdated state we've already done we've just manipulated the state here. So all\njust manipulated the state here. So all\njust manipulated the state here. So all we have to do is just simply return the\nwe have to do is just simply return the\nwe have to do is just simply return the state. Cool. And yeah that runs without\nstate. Cool. And yeah that runs without\nstate. Cool. And yeah that runs without any errors. Okay. Now let's actually\nany errors. Okay. Now let's actually\nany errors. Okay. Now let's actually build the graph uh which is again\nbuild the graph uh which is again\nbuild the graph uh which is again obviously very important. So how do we\nobviously very important. So how do we\nobviously very important. So how do we build the graph? Remember here I said\nbuild the graph? Remember here I said\nbuild the graph? Remember here I said state graph is a framework that helps us\nstate graph is a framework that helps us\nstate graph is a framework that helps us design and manage the flow of tasks as a\ndesign and manage the flow of tasks as a\ndesign and manage the flow of tasks as a graph. Well that's exactly what we're\ngraph. Well that's exactly what we're\ngraph. Well that's exactly what we're about to do now. So hopefully it clicks\nabout to do now. So hopefully it clicks\nabout to do now. So hopefully it clicks now. So to create a graph in lang graph\nnow. So to create a graph in lang graph\nnow. So to create a graph in lang graph you use the state graph attribute and\nyou use the state graph attribute and\nyou use the state graph attribute and you pass in your state. You can see the\nyou pass in your state. You can see the\nyou pass in your state. You can see the state schema which VS code has uh asked\nstate schema which VS code has uh asked\nstate schema which VS code has uh asked for what uh the description of what the\nfor what uh the description of what the\nfor what uh the description of what the parameters are. So our state schema in\nparameters are. So our state schema in\nparameters are. So our state schema in this case is just the agent state which\nthis case is just the agent state which\nthis case is just the agent state which we define right. So we pass an agent\nwe define right. So we pass an agent\nwe define right. So we pass an agent state. I will actually also write here\nstate. I will actually also write here\nstate. I will actually also write here our state\nour state\nour state schema. So\nschema. So\nschema. So uh you can physically see what it is.\nuh you can physically see what it is.\nuh you can physically see what it is. Okay. And let's store this in a variable\nOkay. And let's store this in a variable\nOkay. And let's store this in a variable called graph or something. Okay. Now now\ncalled graph or something. Okay. Now now\ncalled graph or something. Okay. Now now here comes a very important method. How\nhere comes a very important method. How\nhere comes a very important method. How do we actually add a node to this graph?\ndo we actually add a node to this graph?\ndo we actually add a node to this graph? Cuz this graph is completely like\nCuz this graph is completely like\nCuz this graph is completely like nothing right now. So to add a node we\nnothing right now. So to add a node we\nnothing right now. So to add a node we use the inbuilt function graph add node\nuse the inbuilt function graph add node\nuse the inbuilt function graph add node and it requires two main parameters. Now\nand it requires two main parameters. Now\nand it requires two main parameters. Now what VS code is suggesting is a god I\nwhat VS code is suggesting is a god I\nwhat VS code is suggesting is a god I don't even know what that all of all of\ndon't even know what that all of all of\ndon't even know what that all of all of that is right it's very confusing. So to\nthat is right it's very confusing. So to\nthat is right it's very confusing. So to put things simply you require really two\nput things simply you require really two\nput things simply you require really two uh parameters the name of your node and\nuh parameters the name of your node and\nuh parameters the name of your node and what action it will perform. So let's go\nwhat action it will perform. So let's go\nwhat action it will perform. So let's go with the name. The name could be\nwith the name. The name could be\nwith the name. The name could be absolutely anything sensible of course.\nabsolutely anything sensible of course.\nabsolutely anything sensible of course. Um let's call something like\nUm let's call something like\nUm let's call something like greeter. Cool. And you can see VS Code\ngreeter. Cool. And you can see VS Code\ngreeter. Cool. And you can see VS Code has also asked us to um input an action.\nhas also asked us to um input an action.\nhas also asked us to um input an action. Now what's the action going to be? Well,\nNow what's the action going to be? Well,\nNow what's the action going to be? Well, the action will just be whatever your\nthe action will just be whatever your\nthe action will just be whatever your node will actually perform. And what\nnode will actually perform. And what\nnode will actually perform. And what action or mechanics will this node\naction or mechanics will this node\naction or mechanics will this node actually perform? Well, all of that is\nactually perform? Well, all of that is\nactually perform? Well, all of that is defined by this function, right? The\ndefined by this function, right? The\ndefined by this function, right? The greeting node function. So we simply\ngreeting node function. So we simply\ngreeting node function. So we simply just put that the name of the greeting\njust put that the name of the greeting\njust put that the name of the greeting node function here and that's it. We've\nnode function here and that's it. We've\nnode function here and that's it. We've successfully added the greeting node to\nsuccessfully added the greeting node to\nsuccessfully added the greeting node to our function to our graph and it will be\nour function to our graph and it will be\nour function to our graph and it will be named as\nnamed as\nnamed as greater. So remember this\ngreater. So remember this\ngreater. So remember this diagram in this diagram there is\ndiagram in this diagram there is\ndiagram in this diagram there is supposed to be a start and an end point.\nsupposed to be a start and an end point.\nsupposed to be a start and an end point. We've done the node which is sandwiched\nWe've done the node which is sandwiched\nWe've done the node which is sandwiched in between these but we haven't really\nin between these but we haven't really\nin between these but we haven't really added the start and the end point yet.\nadded the start and the end point yet.\nadded the start and the end point yet. So, how do we do that? Well, there's\nSo, how do we do that? Well, there's\nSo, how do we do that? Well, there's actually multiple ways to do that. In\nactually multiple ways to do that. In\nactually multiple ways to do that. In this subsection, in this graph, I'm\nthis subsection, in this graph, I'm\nthis subsection, in this graph, I'm going to teach you one way. Further down\ngoing to teach you one way. Further down\ngoing to teach you one way. Further down the line, I'll teach you another way.\nthe line, I'll teach you another way.\nthe line, I'll teach you another way. So, but they're both they're quite easy.\nSo, but they're both they're quite easy.\nSo, but they're both they're quite easy. So, you simply just call the inbuilt\nSo, you simply just call the inbuilt\nSo, you simply just call the inbuilt function set entry\nfunction set entry\nfunction set entry point and as the parameter is just one\npoint and as the parameter is just one\npoint and as the parameter is just one parameter which is the key. Now, the key\nparameter which is the key. Now, the key\nparameter which is the key. Now, the key is the name of your node which you want\nis the name of your node which you want\nis the name of your node which you want the start node to connect to. Again,\nthe start node to connect to. Again,\nthe start node to connect to. Again, visualize it. The start the start point\nvisualize it. The start the start point\nvisualize it. The start the start point is here and the node is here. Obviously\nis here and the node is here. Obviously\nis here and the node is here. Obviously you need to reference a node for it to\nyou need to reference a node for it to\nyou need to reference a node for it to create like an edge right. So we simply\ncreate like an edge right. So we simply\ncreate like an edge right. So we simply pass greater and similarly graph dot set\npass greater and similarly graph dot set\npass greater and similarly graph dot set finish point. We will again pass greater\nfinish point. We will again pass greater\nfinish point. We will again pass greater here as well. Why? Because imagine again\nhere as well. Why? Because imagine again\nhere as well. Why? Because imagine again the node is here and your finish point\nthe node is here and your finish point\nthe node is here and your finish point is here and you need to connect some\nis here and you need to connect some\nis here and you need to connect some sort of connection between these two\nsort of connection between these two\nsort of connection between these two right and that's why we use uh greater\nright and that's why we use uh greater\nright and that's why we use uh greater in this case. Don't worry, you will\nin this case. Don't worry, you will\nin this case. Don't worry, you will solidify this once you complete the\nsolidify this once you complete the\nsolidify this once you complete the exercises and as we go down building\nexercises and as we go down building\nexercises and as we go down building more graphs. All right. And one last\nmore graphs. All right. And one last\nmore graphs. All right. And one last thing which we need to do is actually\nthing which we need to do is actually\nthing which we need to do is actually compile this graph. So graph compile\ncompile this graph. So graph compile\ncompile this graph. So graph compile using the inbuilt uh graph using the\nusing the inbuilt uh graph using the\nusing the inbuilt uh graph using the inbuilt compile function. And let's just\ninbuilt compile function. And let's just\ninbuilt compile function. And let's just store this in a\nstore this in a\nstore this in a variable. Cool. So that run without any\nvariable. Cool. So that run without any\nvariable. Cool. So that run without any errors. But just a word of caution here.\nerrors. But just a word of caution here.\nerrors. But just a word of caution here. Just because the graph compiles without\nJust because the graph compiles without\nJust because the graph compiles without any error doesn't mean it will\nany error doesn't mean it will\nany error doesn't mean it will successfully run. I mean, God knows once\nsuccessfully run. I mean, God knows once\nsuccessfully run. I mean, God knows once we build like more complicated graphs,\nwe build like more complicated graphs,\nwe build like more complicated graphs, there could be so many logical errors.\nthere could be so many logical errors.\nthere could be so many logical errors. So, that's just an important thing to\nSo, that's just an important thing to\nSo, that's just an important thing to know. So, don't get too happy once it\nknow. So, don't get too happy once it\nknow. So, don't get too happy once it compiles cuz there might be logical\ncompiles cuz there might be logical\ncompiles cuz there might be logical errors. Trust me, I know. Okay.\nerrors. Trust me, I know. Okay.\nerrors. Trust me, I know. Okay. So, I want to write some code which will\nSo, I want to write some code which will\nSo, I want to write some code which will actually help you visualize this. And\nactually help you visualize this. And\nactually help you visualize this. And you can use the IPython library. So, you\nyou can use the IPython library. So, you\nyou can use the IPython library. So, you can use this uh this um piece of code\ncan use this uh this um piece of code\ncan use this uh this um piece of code here.\nhere.\nhere. This code is awfully familiar with the\nThis code is awfully familiar with the\nThis code is awfully familiar with the first ever graph I showed you, right? I\nfirst ever graph I showed you, right? I\nfirst ever graph I showed you, right? I I'll put a picture somewhere here for\nI'll put a picture somewhere here for\nI'll put a picture somewhere here for you to compare. The only difference is\nyou to compare. The only difference is\nyou to compare. The only difference is really the name of the node which we've\nreally the name of the node which we've\nreally the name of the node which we've set. In this case, it's greater. Why is\nset. In this case, it's greater. Why is\nset. In this case, it's greater. Why is it greater? Because that's the name we\nit greater? Because that's the name we\nit greater? Because that's the name we gave to this node, right? Cool. So\ngave to this node, right? Cool. So\ngave to this node, right? Cool. So that's looks pretty good. Let's actually\nthat's looks pretty good. Let's actually\nthat's looks pretty good. Let's actually run this. So to run you use the inbuilt\nrun this. So to run you use the inbuilt\nrun this. So to run you use the inbuilt method\nmethod\nmethod invoke. Um so let's pass in the message\ninvoke. Um so let's pass in the message\ninvoke. Um so let's pass in the message as something like Bob or something and\nas something like Bob or something and\nas something like Bob or something and let's actually store this result in a\nvariable. Okay. Now how can we actually\nvariable. Okay. Now how can we actually specify uh how can we actually get the\nspecify uh how can we actually get the\nspecify uh how can we actually get the value of result?\nvalue of result?\nvalue of result? So result we need to actually reference\nSo result we need to actually reference\nSo result we need to actually reference a certain attribute. Now the only\na certain attribute. Now the only\na certain attribute. Now the only attribute we have in uh the entire graph\nattribute we have in uh the entire graph\nattribute we have in uh the entire graph is message right. So we simply just put\nis message right. So we simply just put\nis message right. So we simply just put message and perfect you we get the final\nmessage and perfect you we get the final\nmessage and perfect you we get the final answer which is hey Bob how's your day\nanswer which is hey Bob how's your day\nanswer which is hey Bob how's your day going now why is it like this because\ngoing now why is it like this because\ngoing now why is it like this because this is exactly how we set our act how\nthis is exactly how we set our act how\nthis is exactly how we set our act how we set our function to be what action it\nwe set our function to be what action it\nwe set our function to be what action it performs it says hey then concatenates\nperforms it says hey then concatenates\nperforms it says hey then concatenates the uh input message in this case it's\nthe uh input message in this case it's\nthe uh input message in this case it's just the name and it says how's your day\njust the name and it says how's your day\njust the name and it says how's your day going now I could have changed this to\ngoing now I could have changed this to\ngoing now I could have changed this to absolutely anything else right uh what\nabsolutely anything else right uh what\nabsolutely anything else right uh what goes here like these functions are\ngoes here like these functions are\ngoes here like these functions are almost endless but That's the whole flow\nalmost endless but That's the whole flow\nalmost endless but That's the whole flow of how everything works. So hopefully\nof how everything works. So hopefully\nof how everything works. So hopefully you understood how to build this very\nyou understood how to build this very\nyou understood how to build this very first hello world graph. It's quite\nfirst hello world graph. It's quite\nfirst hello world graph. It's quite simple. But um don't worry if you didn't\nsimple. But um don't worry if you didn't\nsimple. But um don't worry if you didn't fully 100% understand this. I'm now\nfully 100% understand this. I'm now\nfully 100% understand this. I'm now going to show you what exercise you need\ngoing to show you what exercise you need\ngoing to show you what exercise you need to complete uh to be able to solidify\nto complete uh to be able to solidify\nto complete uh to be able to solidify this. All right. All right. I'll see you\nthis. All right. All right. I'll see you\nthis. All right. All right. I'll see you at the\nat the\nat the exercise. Okay. So time for your very\nexercise. Okay. So time for your very\nexercise. Okay. So time for your very first exercise. So the exercise for this\nfirst exercise. So the exercise for this\nfirst exercise. So the exercise for this graph is quite similar to what we just\ngraph is quite similar to what we just\ngraph is quite similar to what we just did, but I want you to create a\ndid, but I want you to create a\ndid, but I want you to create a personalized compliment agent. So you\npersonalized compliment agent. So you\npersonalized compliment agent. So you should pass in your name as like\nshould pass in your name as like\nshould pass in your name as like something like Bob or something and then\nsomething like Bob or something and then\nsomething like Bob or something and then output something like Bob, you're doing\noutput something like Bob, you're doing\noutput something like Bob, you're doing an amazing job learning langraph. And to\nan amazing job learning langraph. And to\nan amazing job learning langraph. And to give you a hint as to what you need to\ngive you a hint as to what you need to\ngive you a hint as to what you need to do again, you again have to concatenate\ndo again, you again have to concatenate\ndo again, you again have to concatenate the state, not replace it. All right,\nthe state, not replace it. All right,\nthe state, not replace it. All right, it's very similar to what we just did\nit's very similar to what we just did\nit's very similar to what we just did and it's quite basic. You should be able\nand it's quite basic. You should be able\nand it's quite basic. You should be able to do this, but um this is really just\nto do this, but um this is really just\nto do this, but um this is really just to get your hands dirty. All right.\nto get your hands dirty. All right.\nto get your hands dirty. All right. Okay. Once you've completed this\nOkay. Once you've completed this\nOkay. Once you've completed this exercise, join me when we build the\nexercise, join me when we build the\nexercise, join me when we build the second graph. I'll see you\nsecond graph. I'll see you\nsecond graph. I'll see you there. Okay. So now we're about to build\nthere. Okay. So now we're about to build\nthere. Okay. So now we're about to build our second graph as you can see here.\nour second graph as you can see here.\nour second graph as you can see here. And it's again quite similar to the\nAnd it's again quite similar to the\nAnd it's again quite similar to the first graph we built except now we're\nfirst graph we built except now we're\nfirst graph we built except now we're going to be able to pass multiple inputs\ngoing to be able to pass multiple inputs\ngoing to be able to pass multiple inputs as you can see here. So again, what are\nas you can see here. So again, what are\nas you can see here. So again, what are the objectives which you will be\nthe objectives which you will be\nthe objectives which you will be learning in this? Well, we're going to\nlearning in this? Well, we're going to\nlearning in this? Well, we're going to build a more complicated agent state.\nbuild a more complicated agent state.\nbuild a more complicated agent state. Uh, and we're going to be creating a\nUh, and we're going to be creating a\nUh, and we're going to be creating a processing node that performs operations\nprocessing node that performs operations\nprocessing node that performs operations on list data. So now we're about to see\non list data. So now we're about to see\non list data. So now we're about to see how we can really work with different\nhow we can really work with different\nhow we can really work with different data types apart from just string. And\ndata types apart from just string. And\ndata types apart from just string. And we're going to set up the entire graph\nwe're going to set up the entire graph\nwe're going to set up the entire graph that processes and outputs these and\nthat processes and outputs these and\nthat processes and outputs these and computes these results. And we're going\ncomputes these results. And we're going\ncomputes these results. And we're going to be able to invoke the graph with the\nto be able to invoke the graph with the\nto be able to invoke the graph with the structured inputs and retrieve the\nstructured inputs and retrieve the\nstructured inputs and retrieve the outputs. But the main goal which uh I\noutputs. But the main goal which uh I\noutputs. But the main goal which uh I want you to be able to learn in this\nwant you to be able to learn in this\nwant you to be able to learn in this specific subsection is really how to\nspecific subsection is really how to\nspecific subsection is really how to handle multiple inputs. All right. Okay.\nhandle multiple inputs. All right. Okay.\nhandle multiple inputs. All right. Okay. Let's code\nLet's code\nLet's code this. Okay. So now let's actually code\nthis. Okay. So now let's actually code\nthis. Okay. So now let's actually code the second graph up the second\nthe second graph up the second\nthe second graph up the second application up. So again I've just\napplication up. So again I've just\napplication up. So again I've just imported the same things again the type\nimported the same things again the type\nimported the same things again the type dictionary and the state graph. And I've\ndictionary and the state graph. And I've\ndictionary and the state graph. And I've also imported the list this time. But\nalso imported the list this time. But\nalso imported the list this time. But list is just a simple data structure\nlist is just a simple data structure\nlist is just a simple data structure which you should know already. So if you\nwhich you should know already. So if you\nwhich you should know already. So if you remember from the previous graph we made\nremember from the previous graph we made\nremember from the previous graph we made we are supposed to uh implement the\nwe are supposed to uh implement the\nwe are supposed to uh implement the state schema first right. So how do we\nstate schema first right. So how do we\nstate schema first right. So how do we do that? Again we use the class agent\ndo that? Again we use the class agent\ndo that? Again we use the class agent state uh type\nstate uh type\nstate uh type dictionary. Okay before I continue just\ndictionary. Okay before I continue just\ndictionary. Okay before I continue just a heads up I could have named the state\na heads up I could have named the state\na heads up I could have named the state schema anything I want. I could have\nschema anything I want. I could have\nschema anything I want. I could have named it uh something arbitrary\nnamed it uh something arbitrary\nnamed it uh something arbitrary completely like a bottle for example. In\ncompletely like a bottle for example. In\ncompletely like a bottle for example. In this case I've just said agent state\nthis case I've just said agent state\nthis case I've just said agent state because one that's how I learned it.\nbecause one that's how I learned it.\nbecause one that's how I learned it. It's like a habit for me now. But it\nIt's like a habit for me now. But it\nIt's like a habit for me now. But it also really tells you what it actually\nalso really tells you what it actually\nalso really tells you what it actually is. It's the state of your agent, right?\nis. It's the state of your agent, right?\nis. It's the state of your agent, right? So that's why I've just kept it like\nSo that's why I've just kept it like\nSo that's why I've just kept it like that. But again, just a heads up, you\nthat. But again, just a heads up, you\nthat. But again, just a heads up, you could have named this whatever you want.\ncould have named this whatever you want.\ncould have named this whatever you want. Cool. Okay. So now let's the if you\nCool. Okay. So now let's the if you\nCool. Okay. So now let's the if you remember the main goal for this graph\nremember the main goal for this graph\nremember the main goal for this graph for this uh building this graph was to\nfor this uh building this graph was to\nfor this uh building this graph was to be able to handle and process multiple\nbe able to handle and process multiple\nbe able to handle and process multiple different inputs, right? So how do we\ndifferent inputs, right? So how do we\ndifferent inputs, right? So how do we actually assign and I really do that?\nactually assign and I really do that?\nactually assign and I really do that? Well, the answer is in the state which\nWell, the answer is in the state which\nWell, the answer is in the state which is here's what uh which is what we're\nis here's what uh which is what we're\nis here's what uh which is what we're about to do now. So you really cuz\nabout to do now. So you really cuz\nabout to do now. So you really cuz remember this is just a type dictionary.\nremember this is just a type dictionary.\nremember this is just a type dictionary. So you basically have multiple keys now\nSo you basically have multiple keys now\nSo you basically have multiple keys now you uh create that. So let's say\nyou uh create that. So let's say\nyou uh create that. So let's say something like\nsomething like\nsomething like values list integers.\nvalues list integers.\nvalues list integers. So let's say one of our input is a list\nSo let's say one of our input is a list\nSo let's say one of our input is a list of integers and let's also pass in a\nof integers and let's also pass in a\nof integers and let's also pass in a name which will obviously be in a string\nname which will obviously be in a string\nname which will obviously be in a string and let's have the result in a string\nand let's have the result in a string\nand let's have the result in a string something completely random. But now you\nsomething completely random. But now you\nsomething completely random. But now you can see we're now operating on two\ncan see we're now operating on two\ncan see we're now operating on two different types of data structures uh a\ndifferent types of data structures uh a\ndifferent types of data structures uh a a list of integers and a string. And\na list of integers and a string. And\na list of integers and a string. And we're handling three different uh\nwe're handling three different uh\nwe're handling three different uh different uh uh inputs values name\ndifferent uh uh inputs values name\ndifferent uh uh inputs values name result. Okay cool. So let's run this.\nresult. Okay cool. So let's run this.\nresult. Okay cool. So let's run this. Perfect. So now let's actually build our\nPerfect. So now let's actually build our\nPerfect. So now let's actually build our node because in again in this uh graph\nnode because in again in this uh graph\nnode because in again in this uh graph we're just going to have a single node\nwe're just going to have a single node\nwe're just going to have a single node to keep things easy. Remember step by\nto keep things easy. Remember step by\nto keep things easy. Remember step by step. So let's call let's write dev\nstep. So let's call let's write dev\nstep. So let's call let's write dev process values and again what was what\nprocess values and again what was what\nprocess values and again what was what needs to be\nhere? Yeah. So we need to pass in the\nhere? Yeah. So we need to pass in the state and we need to return the updated\nstate and we need to return the updated\nstate and we need to return the updated state. So how do we do that? Well, we\nstate. So how do we do that? Well, we\nstate. So how do we do that? Well, we write state agent state and we pass out\nwrite state agent state and we pass out\nwrite state agent state and we pass out the agent state. Cool. Now, again,\nthe agent state. Cool. Now, again,\nthe agent state. Cool. Now, again, building healthy habits. I know it's\nbuilding healthy habits. I know it's\nbuilding healthy habits. I know it's annoying. We have to write the dog\nannoying. We have to write the dog\nannoying. We have to write the dog string. So, let's just write something\nstring. So, let's just write something\nstring. So, let's just write something like this\nlike this\nlike this function process\nfunction process\nfunction process handles multiple\nhandles multiple\nhandles multiple different value in multiple different\ndifferent value in multiple different\ndifferent value in multiple different inputs. Cool. Again, I'm not being super\ninputs. Cool. Again, I'm not being super\ninputs. Cool. Again, I'm not being super specific here because one, uh, I don't\nspecific here because one, uh, I don't\nspecific here because one, uh, I don't want to spend too long on writing\nwant to spend too long on writing\nwant to spend too long on writing doctrines and everything, and two,\ndoctrines and everything, and two,\ndoctrines and everything, and two, there's no AI or LLM here, right? So\nthere's no AI or LLM here, right? So\nthere's no AI or LLM here, right? So that's why it doesn't really matter. I'm\nthat's why it doesn't really matter. I'm\nthat's why it doesn't really matter. I'm just doing this to build healthy habits.\njust doing this to build healthy habits.\njust doing this to build healthy habits. Okay, so now let's do something like\nOkay, so now let's do something like\nOkay, so now let's do something like whatever values we pass the list of\nwhatever values we pass the list of\nwhatever values we pass the list of integers. Let's sum them up. And let's\nintegers. Let's sum them up. And let's\nintegers. Let's sum them up. And let's also concatenate the name as well and\nalso concatenate the name as well and\nalso concatenate the name as well and store it in the result. Sound cool?\nstore it in the result. Sound cool?\nstore it in the result. Sound cool? Okay, so how do we do that? We pass in\nOkay, so how do we do that? We pass in\nOkay, so how do we do that? We pass in state result cuz that's what we are uh\nstate result cuz that's what we are uh\nstate result cuz that's what we are uh the action we're performing is on result\nthe action we're performing is on result\nthe action we're performing is on result uh the attribute result and let's say\nuh the attribute result and let's say\nuh the attribute result and let's say something like hi\nsomething like hi\nsomething like hi there and then we refer to the name\nthere and then we refer to the name\nthere and then we refer to the name um cool and your sum is equal to and\num cool and your sum is equal to and\num cool and your sum is equal to and let's just use the inbuilt Python\nlet's just use the inbuilt Python\nlet's just use the inbuilt Python function sum and we pass state\nfunction sum and we pass state\nfunction sum and we pass state values cool and lastly we obviously\nvalues cool and lastly we obviously\nvalues cool and lastly we obviously return the\nreturn the\nreturn the Okay, perfect. And that's that done.\nOkay, perfect. And that's that done.\nOkay, perfect. And that's that done. Okay, so now we actually create the\nOkay, so now we actually create the\nOkay, so now we actually create the graph. Again, this is going to be very\ngraph. Again, this is going to be very\ngraph. Again, this is going to be very very similar to what we did in the\nvery similar to what we did in the\nvery similar to what we did in the previous section because again there's\nprevious section because again there's\nprevious section because again there's just a node, there's a start point and\njust a node, there's a start point and\njust a node, there's a start point and an endpoint. So like last time, we use\nan endpoint. So like last time, we use\nan endpoint. So like last time, we use the state graph to initialize a graph\nthe state graph to initialize a graph\nthe state graph to initialize a graph and we pass in our state schema. So\nand we pass in our state schema. So\nand we pass in our state schema. So agent state and let's store this in the\nagent state and let's store this in the\nagent state and let's store this in the variable graph. Okay. Uh let's add our\nvariable graph. Okay. Uh let's add our\nvariable graph. Okay. Uh let's add our node. So graph add\nnode. So graph add\nnode. So graph add node and again remember it requires two\nnode and again remember it requires two\nnode and again remember it requires two parameters. It requires the name and the\nparameters. It requires the name and the\nparameters. It requires the name and the action. So in this case the name will be\naction. So in this case the name will be\naction. So in this case the name will be let's call it processor for example.\nlet's call it processor for example.\nlet's call it processor for example. Again this could be anything you want\nAgain this could be anything you want\nAgain this could be anything you want and your action will be performed by\nand your action will be performed by\nand your action will be performed by this function right process values. So\nthis function right process values. So\nthis function right process values. So we can just add that. Okay. Now I've\nwe can just add that. Okay. Now I've\nwe can just add that. Okay. Now I've already told you how to uh how to\nalready told you how to uh how to\nalready told you how to uh how to initialize a start point and an end\ninitialize a start point and an end\ninitialize a start point and an end point and this is just given by that\npoint and this is just given by that\npoint and this is just given by that code. So you attach your entry point to\ncode. So you attach your entry point to\ncode. So you attach your entry point to your node. In this case it's just one\nyour node. In this case it's just one\nyour node. In this case it's just one node which is the processor node and\nnode which is the processor node and\nnode which is the processor node and again same goes with finish and you\nagain same goes with finish and you\nagain same goes with finish and you compile it using\ncompile it using\ncompile it using graph.compile. Perfect. So take a moment\ngraph.compile. Perfect. So take a moment\ngraph.compile. Perfect. So take a moment now. How do you think this graph will\nnow. How do you think this graph will\nnow. How do you think this graph will look\nlike? That again like I said very very\nlike? That again like I said very very similar on how the graph actually looks\nsimilar on how the graph actually looks\nsimilar on how the graph actually looks like but the only difference now is the\nlike but the only difference now is the\nlike but the only difference now is the name of the uh node which we've kept\nname of the uh node which we've kept\nname of the uh node which we've kept this as processor. Okay. So now let's\nthis as processor. Okay. So now let's\nthis as processor. Okay. So now let's actually test this. Let's actually\nactually test this. Let's actually\nactually test this. Let's actually invoke this graph. So how do we do that?\ninvoke this graph. So how do we do that?\ninvoke this graph. So how do we do that? Well, we use the invoke function. Now\nWell, we use the invoke function. Now\nWell, we use the invoke function. Now here's another important part which is\nhere's another important part which is\nhere's another important part which is quite a common mistake especially like I\nquite a common mistake especially like I\nquite a common mistake especially like I have done this many times. Make sure to\nhave done this many times. Make sure to\nhave done this many times. Make sure to store your compiled graph in a variable\nstore your compiled graph in a variable\nstore your compiled graph in a variable cuz if you invoke the graph i.e. if you\ncuz if you invoke the graph i.e. if you\ncuz if you invoke the graph i.e. if you write something like graph.invoke that\nwrite something like graph.invoke that\nwrite something like graph.invoke that won't make sense cuz you haven't\nwon't make sense cuz you haven't\nwon't make sense cuz you haven't compiled the graph. That's why you need\ncompiled the graph. That's why you need\ncompiled the graph. That's why you need to uh invoke using app. That's why I've\nto uh invoke using app. That's why I've\nto uh invoke using app. That's why I've also done app here. If I did graph get\nalso done app here. If I did graph get\nalso done app here. If I did graph get graph. Oh, it's completely messed up.\ngraph. Oh, it's completely messed up.\ngraph. Oh, it's completely messed up. Right? It says state graph object has no\nRight? It says state graph object has no\nRight? It says state graph object has no attribute because your graph hasn't been\nattribute because your graph hasn't been\nattribute because your graph hasn't been compiled yet. That's why when I do\ncompiled yet. That's why when I do\ncompiled yet. That's why when I do appget graph the uh process works. Cool.\nappget graph the uh process works. Cool.\nappget graph the uh process works. Cool. So now let's again store this in uh\nSo now let's again store this in uh\nSo now let's again store this in uh let's store something like answers is\nlet's store something like answers is\nlet's store something like answers is equal to app.invoke. Cool. Let's pass in\nequal to app.invoke. Cool. Let's pass in\nequal to app.invoke. Cool. Let's pass in some values. Let's say something like\nsome values. Let's say something like\nsome values. Let's say something like values and let's have a list of\nvalues and let's have a list of\nvalues and let's have a list of integers. 1 2 3 4. Again, I'm just\nintegers. 1 2 3 4. Again, I'm just\nintegers. 1 2 3 4. Again, I'm just trying to prove a point. I'm not trying\ntrying to prove a point. I'm not trying\ntrying to prove a point. I'm not trying to make a very complicated um graph yet.\nto make a very complicated um graph yet.\nto make a very complicated um graph yet. And let's pass the name as something\nAnd let's pass the name as something\nAnd let's pass the name as something like\nlike\nlike Steve something. Okay. Uh cool. And\nSteve something. Okay. Uh cool. And\nSteve something. Okay. Uh cool. And let's print let's print answers. Let's\nlet's print let's print answers. Let's\nlet's print let's print answers. Let's see what\nsee what\nsee what happens. Perfect. So now you can see\nhappens. Perfect. So now you can see\nhappens. Perfect. So now you can see your values is 1 2 3 4. Your name is\nyour values is 1 2 3 4. Your name is\nyour values is 1 2 3 4. Your name is Steve. And your result is Hi there\nSteve. And your result is Hi there\nSteve. And your result is Hi there Steve. Your sum is equal to 10. Again,\nSteve. Your sum is equal to 10. Again,\nSteve. Your sum is equal to 10. Again, why? because that's exactly what we uh\nwhy? because that's exactly what we uh\nwhy? because that's exactly what we uh asked the node the action to perform. Hi\nasked the node the action to perform. Hi\nasked the node the action to perform. Hi there, your name which in this case is\nthere, your name which in this case is\nthere, your name which in this case is Steve. Your sum is equal to the sum of\nSteve. Your sum is equal to the sum of\nSteve. Your sum is equal to the sum of the values and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 is 10.\nthe values and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 is 10.\nthe values and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 is 10. Right? And that's how you get this\nRight? And that's how you get this\nRight? And that's how you get this answer. Now what if I wanted to just\nanswer. Now what if I wanted to just\nanswer. Now what if I wanted to just access result? I didn't want any of this\naccess result? I didn't want any of this\naccess result? I didn't want any of this other uh\nother uh\nother uh nonsense. Well to do that you can again\nnonsense. Well to do that you can again\nnonsense. Well to do that you can again just specify result and you will get it\njust specify result and you will get it\njust specify result and you will get it in a more clean manner.\nin a more clean manner.\nin a more clean manner. Cool. Okay. Now I want to try one more\nCool. Okay. Now I want to try one more\nCool. Okay. Now I want to try one more thing just to build your understanding a\nthing just to build your understanding a\nthing just to build your understanding a bit more. Uh let's put some print\nbit more. Uh let's put some print\nbit more. Uh let's put some print statements here. So let's have a print\nstatements here. So let's have a print\nstatements here. So let's have a print state\nstate\nstate here. Then we perform the action and\nhere. Then we perform the action and\nhere. Then we perform the action and then we print the state here. This is\nthen we print the state here. This is\nthen we print the state here. This is really just to show you how the state\nreally just to show you how the state\nreally just to show you how the state gets updated and it should be easy like\ngets updated and it should be easy like\ngets updated and it should be easy like interpretable cuz this is quite a basic\ninterpretable cuz this is quite a basic\ninterpretable cuz this is quite a basic piece of code. Again, print stated\npiece of code. Again, print stated\npiece of code. Again, print stated before the action and print state after.\nbefore the action and print state after.\nbefore the action and print state after. So there\nSo there\nSo there cool and here you go. So value is equal\ncool and here you go. So value is equal\ncool and here you go. So value is equal to 1 2 3 4 name is equal to Steve and\nto 1 2 3 4 name is equal to Steve and\nto 1 2 3 4 name is equal to Steve and these are the inputs we passed. Now\nthese are the inputs we passed. Now\nthese are the inputs we passed. Now notice I didn't pass results as an input\nnotice I didn't pass results as an input\nnotice I didn't pass results as an input as well. I could have uh done that but\nas well. I could have uh done that but\nas well. I could have uh done that but Langraph automatically sets that as like\nLangraph automatically sets that as like\nLangraph automatically sets that as like a a none value in this case if you don't\na a none value in this case if you don't\na a none value in this case if you don't pass an\npass an\npass an input. Now here's where you need to be\ninput. Now here's where you need to be\ninput. Now here's where you need to be cautious. If I had actually used state\ncautious. If I had actually used state\ncautious. If I had actually used state result here as well to uh update state\nresult here as well to uh update state\nresult here as well to uh update state result like I used state result to\nresult like I used state result to\nresult like I used state result to update either itself or something else\nupdate either itself or something else\nupdate either itself or something else then you would run into a problem\nthen you would run into a problem\nthen you would run into a problem because your state result has been\nbecause your state result has been\nbecause your state result has been initialized as none because you didn't\ninitialized as none because you didn't\ninitialized as none because you didn't pass it as an input. So be mindful of\npass it as an input. So be mindful of\npass it as an input. So be mindful of that. But in this case it worked because\nthat. But in this case it worked because\nthat. But in this case it worked because we're only assigning state result. We're\nwe're only assigning state result. We're\nwe're only assigning state result. We're not using it to assign something. It's\nnot using it to assign something. It's\nnot using it to assign something. It's getting assigned. Cool. And you can see\ngetting assigned. Cool. And you can see\ngetting assigned. Cool. And you can see after the action has been performed uh\nafter the action has been performed uh\nafter the action has been performed uh your operation has been performed and\nyour operation has been performed and\nyour operation has been performed and the thing has been concatenated. You can\nthe thing has been concatenated. You can\nthe thing has been concatenated. You can see result is here and that was exactly\nsee result is here and that was exactly\nsee result is here and that was exactly what we were getting before we cleaned\nwhat we were getting before we cleaned\nwhat we were getting before we cleaned this up. Cool. So hopefully you\nthis up. Cool. So hopefully you\nthis up. Cool. So hopefully you understood that. Again it should have\nunderstood that. Again it should have\nunderstood that. Again it should have been quite intuitive and interpretable\nbeen quite intuitive and interpretable\nbeen quite intuitive and interpretable but um to solidify your understanding\nbut um to solidify your understanding\nbut um to solidify your understanding even more complete the exercise. So I'll\neven more complete the exercise. So I'll\neven more complete the exercise. So I'll see you at the exercise\nsee you at the exercise\nsee you at the exercise then. Okay. Welcome to the exercise,\nthen. Okay. Welcome to the exercise,\nthen. Okay. Welcome to the exercise, your second ever exercise. And for this\nyour second ever exercise. And for this\nyour second ever exercise. And for this exercise, I want you to create a graph\nexercise, I want you to create a graph\nexercise, I want you to create a graph which passes in a single list of\nwhich passes in a single list of\nwhich passes in a single list of integers along with a name and uh an\nintegers along with a name and uh an\nintegers along with a name and uh an operation this time. And if the\noperation this time. And if the\noperation this time. And if the operation is a plus, you add the\noperation is a plus, you add the\noperation is a plus, you add the elements. And if a well times, you\nelements. And if a well times, you\nelements. And if a well times, you multiply all the elements all within the\nmultiply all the elements all within the\nmultiply all the elements all within the same node. So don't create an extra node\nsame node. So don't create an extra node\nsame node. So don't create an extra node yet. So for example your input should\nyet. So for example your input should\nyet. So for example your input should could be jack sparrow your values 1 2 3\ncould be jack sparrow your values 1 2 3\ncould be jack sparrow your values 1 2 3 4 again and then your operation uh uh\n4 again and then your operation uh uh\n4 again and then your operation uh uh multiplication and your output should be\nmultiplication and your output should be\nmultiplication and your output should be in the format of hi jack sparrow your\nin the format of hi jack sparrow your\nin the format of hi jack sparrow your answer is 24 so just to give you a hint\nanswer is 24 so just to give you a hint\nanswer is 24 so just to give you a hint as to how you would perform something\nas to how you would perform something\nas to how you would perform something like this uh you would need an if\nlike this uh you would need an if\nlike this uh you would need an if statement in your node so slightly more\nstatement in your node so slightly more\nstatement in your node so slightly more complicated but the whole concept is the\ncomplicated but the whole concept is the\ncomplicated but the whole concept is the same so once you've completed this\nsame so once you've completed this\nsame so once you've completed this exercise I will see you in when where we\nexercise I will see you in when where we\nexercise I will see you in when where we build this third graph All right, see\nbuild this third graph All right, see\nbuild this third graph All right, see you\nthere. Okay, welcome to your third\nthere. Okay, welcome to your third graph. So, what are we going to do this\ngraph. So, what are we going to do this\ngraph. So, what are we going to do this time? Well, enough processing multiple\ntime? Well, enough processing multiple\ntime? Well, enough processing multiple values and everything. Let's actually\nvalues and everything. Let's actually\nvalues and everything. Let's actually get the graph more complicated. So,\nget the graph more complicated. So,\nget the graph more complicated. So, that's why we're going to be building a\nthat's why we're going to be building a\nthat's why we're going to be building a sequential graph. So, all it all that\nsequential graph. So, all it all that\nsequential graph. So, all it all that basically means is we're going to be\nbasically means is we're going to be\nbasically means is we're going to be creating and handling multiple nodes\ncreating and handling multiple nodes\ncreating and handling multiple nodes that can sequentially process and update\nthat can sequentially process and update\nthat can sequentially process and update different parts of the state. So we will\ndifferent parts of the state. So we will\ndifferent parts of the state. So we will learn how to connect nodes together in a\nlearn how to connect nodes together in a\nlearn how to connect nodes together in a graph through edges of course and we're\ngraph through edges of course and we're\ngraph through edges of course and we're going to invoke the graph and really see\ngoing to invoke the graph and really see\ngoing to invoke the graph and really see how the state gets transformed as we uh\nhow the state gets transformed as we uh\nhow the state gets transformed as we uh progress through our graphs step by\nprogress through our graphs step by\nprogress through our graphs step by step. So again your main goal is should\nstep. So again your main goal is should\nstep. So again your main goal is should be to understand how to create and\nbe to understand how to create and\nbe to understand how to create and handle multiple nodes in langraph.\nhandle multiple nodes in langraph.\nhandle multiple nodes in langraph. Sounds cool. Okay I'll see you at the\nSounds cool. Okay I'll see you at the\nSounds cool. Okay I'll see you at the code. Cool. So now we're about to code\ncode. Cool. So now we're about to code\ncode. Cool. So now we're about to code up the third graph. Uh, and we're making\nup the third graph. Uh, and we're making\nup the third graph. Uh, and we're making quite fast progress. So well done on\nquite fast progress. So well done on\nquite fast progress. So well done on that. So again, the imports are the\nthat. So again, the imports are the\nthat. So again, the imports are the same. State graph and type\nsame. State graph and type\nsame. State graph and type dictionary. Perfect.\ndictionary. Perfect.\ndictionary. Perfect. And like we've done in the previous two\nAnd like we've done in the previous two\nAnd like we've done in the previous two graphs, we're going to be coding the uh\ngraphs, we're going to be coding the uh\ngraphs, we're going to be coding the uh the state schema or the agent state\nthe state schema or the agent state\nthe state schema or the agent state first. So let's have class agent state.\nfirst. So let's have class agent state.\nfirst. So let's have class agent state. And again, it needs to be in the form of\nAnd again, it needs to be in the form of\nAnd again, it needs to be in the form of a typed dictionary, right? And in this\na typed dictionary, right? And in this\na typed dictionary, right? And in this case, let's have the three attributes as\ncase, let's have the three attributes as\ncase, let's have the three attributes as all strings because we've already we\nall strings because we've already we\nall strings because we've already we already know how to handle multiple data\nalready know how to handle multiple data\nalready know how to handle multiple data types, right? So, let's keep it simple.\ntypes, right? So, let's keep it simple.\ntypes, right? So, let's keep it simple. Name string, age string, and final\nName string, age string, and final\nName string, age string, and final string.\nstring.\nstring. Okay. Now, here's what we're going to\nOkay. Now, here's what we're going to\nOkay. Now, here's what we're going to build. Now, we're about to build our two\nbuild. Now, we're about to build our two\nbuild. Now, we're about to build our two node functions,\nnode functions,\nnode functions, uh, which are again the actions. Okay.\nuh, which are again the actions. Okay.\nuh, which are again the actions. Okay. So again you simply write first well\nSo again you simply write first well\nSo again you simply write first well I'll name it first node in this case and\nI'll name it first node in this case and\nI'll name it first node in this case and like I mentioned before we pass in the\nlike I mentioned before we pass in the\nlike I mentioned before we pass in the state and we return the updated state.\nstate and we return the updated state.\nstate and we return the updated state. Okay. So again healthy habits doc string\nOkay. So again healthy habits doc string\nOkay. So again healthy habits doc string again. So this is the first node of our\nagain. So this is the first node of our\nagain. So this is the first node of our sequence. Okay. And what do we want to\nsequence. Okay. And what do we want to\nsequence. Okay. And what do we want to do in this specific node? Well, I really\ndo in this specific node? Well, I really\ndo in this specific node? Well, I really just want to manipulate uh the final\njust want to manipulate uh the final\njust want to manipulate uh the final part. So, let's say something like\npart. So, let's say something like\npart. So, let's say something like state final is equal to state or let's\nstate final is equal to state or let's\nstate final is equal to state or let's have an f string\nf state name.\nf state name. Let's say something like\nLet's say something like\nLet's say something like hi\nhi\nhi that. Cool. And we'll just return the\nthat. Cool. And we'll just return the\nthat. Cool. And we'll just return the state. Perfect. And now again we create\nstate. Perfect. And now again we create\nstate. Perfect. And now again we create a new node. So state agent state. Return\na new node. So state agent state. Return\na new node. So state agent state. Return that. Perfect.\nthat. Perfect.\nthat. Perfect. And I'm just going to copy this dock\nAnd I'm just going to copy this dock\nAnd I'm just going to copy this dock string and just change it. This is the\nstring and just change it. This is the\nstring and just change it. This is the second nerf. Perfect. Okay. To speed\nsecond nerf. Perfect. Okay. To speed\nsecond nerf. Perfect. Okay. To speed things up. And in this case I also want\nthings up. And in this case I also want\nthings up. And in this case I also want to have state final is equal\nto have state final is equal\nto have state final is equal to you are\nto you are\nto you are state\nage years old. Again quite a simple\nage years old. Again quite a simple example easy to follow. That's why I've\nexample easy to follow. That's why I've\nexample easy to follow. That's why I've kept it as quite a basic graph. I mean\nkept it as quite a basic graph. I mean\nkept it as quite a basic graph. I mean it's not going to solve the world's\nit's not going to solve the world's\nit's not going to solve the world's problems or anything but it will help\nproblems or anything but it will help\nproblems or anything but it will help you understand.\nyou understand.\nyou understand. There is one logical error which I've\nThere is one logical error which I've\nThere is one logical error which I've put deliberately here. I want you to try\nput deliberately here. I want you to try\nput deliberately here. I want you to try to identify\nit. Okay. So the logical error in this\nit. Okay. So the logical error in this case is the that once we've built our\ncase is the that once we've built our\ncase is the that once we've built our graph and everything what would have\ngraph and everything what would have\ngraph and everything what would have happened is we would have said hi to\nhappened is we would have said hi to\nhappened is we would have said hi to whoever uh we pass in let's say Charlie\nwhoever uh we pass in let's say Charlie\nwhoever uh we pass in let's say Charlie or something. So, hi Charlie. And we\nor something. So, hi Charlie. And we\nor something. So, hi Charlie. And we store that in the final uh attribute in\nstore that in the final uh attribute in\nstore that in the final uh attribute in the state, which is what we want. But\nthe state, which is what we want. But\nthe state, which is what we want. But here's where things get like start to be\nhere's where things get like start to be\nhere's where things get like start to be well logically incorrect. Once we\nwell logically incorrect. Once we\nwell logically incorrect. Once we finally get to our second node, again,\nfinally get to our second node, again,\nfinally get to our second node, again, we're updating state final, which you\nwe're updating state final, which you\nwe're updating state final, which you can do. You can repeat, you can um\ncan do. You can repeat, you can um\ncan do. You can repeat, you can um interact with these attributes at in in\ninteract with these attributes at in in\ninteract with these attributes at in in any node possible in all of the nodes.\nany node possible in all of the nodes.\nany node possible in all of the nodes. And you can do it as many times as you\nAnd you can do it as many times as you\nAnd you can do it as many times as you want. But notice this part. What's\nwant. But notice this part. What's\nwant. But notice this part. What's happening here is we've completely\nhappening here is we've completely\nhappening here is we've completely replaced all of the content we had\nreplaced all of the content we had\nreplaced all of the content we had before. So remember how we had hi\nbefore. So remember how we had hi\nbefore. So remember how we had hi Charlie? We've just completely replaced\nCharlie? We've just completely replaced\nCharlie? We've just completely replaced it with you are age years old. But we\nit with you are age years old. But we\nit with you are age years old. But we want both of them both of those stuff,\nwant both of them both of those stuff,\nwant both of them both of those stuff, right? So how do we get both of them?\nright? So how do we get both of them?\nright? So how do we get both of them? Well, again we just concatenate them. So\nWell, again we just concatenate them. So\nWell, again we just concatenate them. So we can have something like\nwe can have something like\nwe can have something like state\nstate\nstate plus state file. And there we go.\nplus state file. And there we go.\nplus state file. And there we go. Logical error should be now solved,\nLogical error should be now solved,\nLogical error should be now solved, right? Cuz now we have concatenated\nright? Cuz now we have concatenated\nright? Cuz now we have concatenated state final. Uh we're essentially just\nstate final. Uh we're essentially just\nstate final. Uh we're essentially just like adding on to uh we're preserving\nlike adding on to uh we're preserving\nlike adding on to uh we're preserving what we had before, right? Okay. Now\nwhat we had before, right? Okay. Now\nwhat we had before, right? Okay. Now let's get to the fun part. How do we\nlet's get to the fun part. How do we\nlet's get to the fun part. How do we actually build this graph? And really\nactually build this graph? And really\nactually build this graph? And really it's quite similar to the previous two\nit's quite similar to the previous two\nit's quite similar to the previous two graphs except there is one new thing\ngraphs except there is one new thing\ngraphs except there is one new thing which you're about to learn. So like\nwhich you're about to learn. So like\nwhich you're about to learn. So like always we use state graph to start the\nalways we use state graph to start the\nalways we use state graph to start the framework. So agent state and let's\nframework. So agent state and let's\nframework. So agent state and let's store it in\nstore it in\nstore it in graph. Again I could have had this name\ngraph. Again I could have had this name\ngraph. Again I could have had this name the width variable into anything. I've\nthe width variable into anything. I've\nthe width variable into anything. I've just kept it graph cuz it makes\njust kept it graph cuz it makes\njust kept it graph cuz it makes intuitive sense. Okay. Now we add our\nintuitive sense. Okay. Now we add our\nintuitive sense. Okay. Now we add our nodes. So we do graph add node. And for\nnodes. So we do graph add node. And for\nnodes. So we do graph add node. And for simplicity sake I'm just going to have\nsimplicity sake I'm just going to have\nsimplicity sake I'm just going to have the name as the same name as the uh\nthe name as the same name as the uh\nthe name as the same name as the uh function. Okay. So that way it'll just\nfunction. Okay. So that way it'll just\nfunction. Okay. So that way it'll just be easy to follow. So graph add\nbe easy to follow. So graph add\nbe easy to follow. So graph add node and second\nnode and second\nnode and second node. Second node. Cool. Okay. Now that\nnode. Second node. Cool. Okay. Now that\nnode. Second node. Cool. Okay. Now that we've added both nodes, we need to\nwe've added both nodes, we need to\nwe've added both nodes, we need to obviously s uh add the entry point and\nobviously s uh add the entry point and\nobviously s uh add the entry point and the end point, right? So we set the\nthe end point, right? So we set the\nthe end point, right? So we set the entry point like this. Again, quite\nentry point like this. Again, quite\nentry point like this. Again, quite self-explanatory because we wanted to\nself-explanatory because we wanted to\nself-explanatory because we wanted to connect to the first node, not the\nconnect to the first node, not the\nconnect to the first node, not the second node, right? So it should be\nsecond node, right? So it should be\nsecond node, right? So it should be start uh first node, second node, end\nstart uh first node, second node, end\nstart uh first node, second node, end point. How do we connect the first node\npoint. How do we connect the first node\npoint. How do we connect the first node and the second node together\nthough? Hopefully you had an answer for\nthough? Hopefully you had an answer for that. Uh if you remember or recall from\nthat. Uh if you remember or recall from\nthat. Uh if you remember or recall from the previous section, theory section,\nthe previous section, theory section,\nthe previous section, theory section, there was an element in Langro called\nthere was an element in Langro called\nthere was an element in Langro called the edge. That's exactly what we're\nthe edge. That's exactly what we're\nthe edge. That's exactly what we're about to do right now. We're about to\nabout to do right now. We're about to\nabout to do right now. We're about to use edge and that was the new thing\nuse edge and that was the new thing\nuse edge and that was the new thing which I was talking about a few moments\nwhich I was talking about a few moments\nwhich I was talking about a few moments ago which you're about to learn. So how\nago which you're about to learn. So how\nago which you're about to learn. So how do we use it? Well you use graph edge\ndo we use it? Well you use graph edge\ndo we use it? Well you use graph edge add edge and if we can hi perfect. So\nadd edge and if we can hi perfect. So\nadd edge and if we can hi perfect. So again it's quite simple you use a start\nagain it's quite simple you use a start\nagain it's quite simple you use a start key and end key. So sim similar to entry\nkey and end key. So sim similar to entry\nkey and end key. So sim similar to entry point where but your in this case you\npoint where but your in this case you\npoint where but your in this case you need to pass two parameters. So the edge\nneed to pass two parameters. So the edge\nneed to pass two parameters. So the edge we want is between the first node and\nwe want is between the first node and\nwe want is between the first node and the second node right? Well that's\nthe second node right? Well that's\nthe second node right? Well that's exactly what we pass here. So first node\nexactly what we pass here. So first node\nexactly what we pass here. So first node and second node and like before we will\nand second node and like before we will\nand second node and like before we will just set the finish point at second node\njust set the finish point at second node\njust set the finish point at second node and we will compile this. Now how will\nand we will compile this. Now how will\nand we will compile this. Now how will this graph look like? Take a moment to\nthis graph look like? Take a moment to\nthis graph look like? Take a moment to try to think of how it will look\nlike like that. Start point end point\nlike like that. Start point end point and these two notes are sandwiched in\nand these two notes are sandwiched in\nand these two notes are sandwiched in between. But now there is a\nbetween. But now there is a\nbetween. But now there is a edge. It should be called a directed\nedge. It should be called a directed\nedge. It should be called a directed edge if I'm being like quite picky. But\nedge if I'm being like quite picky. But\nedge if I'm being like quite picky. But yes, a directed edge cuz the flow of\nyes, a directed edge cuz the flow of\nyes, a directed edge cuz the flow of data or your flow of your state updates\ndata or your flow of your state updates\ndata or your flow of your state updates is from the first node to your second\nis from the first node to your second\nis from the first node to your second node. Right? Cool. So now that we've\nnode. Right? Cool. So now that we've\nnode. Right? Cool. So now that we've built that, let's again invoke this. So\nbuilt that, let's again invoke this. So\nbuilt that, let's again invoke this. So I've got this code ready here. Uh let's\nI've got this code ready here. Uh let's\nI've got this code ready here. Uh let's invoke it. Let's pass the parameter as\ninvoke it. Let's pass the parameter as\ninvoke it. Let's pass the parameter as Charlie and let's pass the age as 20.\nCharlie and let's pass the age as 20.\nCharlie and let's pass the age as 20. Cool. Print\nCool. Print\nCool. Print result. Perfect. Apart from the uh\nresult. Perfect. Apart from the uh\nresult. Perfect. Apart from the uh misalignment here which I can just\nmisalignment here which I can just\nmisalignment here which I can just change right\nchange right\nchange right now. Perfect. Okay. So now you can see\nnow. Perfect. Okay. So now you can see\nnow. Perfect. Okay. So now you can see it says hi Charlie you are 20 years old.\nit says hi Charlie you are 20 years old.\nit says hi Charlie you are 20 years old. Now obviously we could have performed\nNow obviously we could have performed\nNow obviously we could have performed all of this in one single node which we\nall of this in one single node which we\nall of this in one single node which we have been doing in the previous\nhave been doing in the previous\nhave been doing in the previous subsection but the obviously the aim was\nsubsection but the obviously the aim was\nsubsection but the obviously the aim was to be able to create multiple nodes\nto be able to create multiple nodes\nto be able to create multiple nodes right and handle um the state how the\nright and handle um the state how the\nright and handle um the state how the state progresses. So yes you one\nstate progresses. So yes you one\nstate progresses. So yes you one important thing which you've learned is\nimportant thing which you've learned is\nimportant thing which you've learned is obviously how to use the add edge method\nobviously how to use the add edge method\nobviously how to use the add edge method but another concept which you have\nbut another concept which you have\nbut another concept which you have solidified here is you can uh change\nsolidified here is you can uh change\nsolidified here is you can uh change these at these keys of your state at in\nthese at these keys of your state at in\nthese at these keys of your state at in at any point in time like as long as as\nat any point in time like as long as as\nat any point in time like as long as as however many times you want cuz remember\nhowever many times you want cuz remember\nhowever many times you want cuz remember here we've passed in state final um we\nhere we've passed in state final um we\nhere we've passed in state final um we implemented state final here we\nimplemented state final here we\nimplemented state final here we implemented state final in the second\nimplemented state final in the second\nimplemented state final in the second node if we had more nodes in the\nnode if we had more nodes in the\nnode if we had more nodes in the sequence. We could have done that again\nsequence. We could have done that again\nsequence. We could have done that again and again and again. And we also learned\nand again and again. And we also learned\nand again and again. And we also learned how to like one key logical error is\nhow to like one key logical error is\nhow to like one key logical error is sometimes a lot of people just\nsometimes a lot of people just\nsometimes a lot of people just accidentally replace uh their content in\naccidentally replace uh their content in\naccidentally replace uh their content in one of the attributes and that leads to\none of the attributes and that leads to\none of the attributes and that leads to a lot of logical errors. So always be\na lot of logical errors. So always be\na lot of logical errors. So always be mindful of that. And yeah, that again\nmindful of that. And yeah, that again\nmindful of that. And yeah, that again was quite simple, not too hard and\nwas quite simple, not too hard and\nwas quite simple, not too hard and hopefully the exercise which I'm about\nhopefully the exercise which I'm about\nhopefully the exercise which I'm about to give you solidifies this. Cool. So I\nto give you solidifies this. Cool. So I\nto give you solidifies this. Cool. So I will see you at the exercise then.\nwill see you at the exercise then.\nwill see you at the exercise then. Awesome. So now we will move on to the\nAwesome. So now we will move on to the\nAwesome. So now we will move on to the exercise for this third graph. And what\nexercise for this third graph. And what\nexercise for this third graph. And what I want you to do is really build on top\nI want you to do is really build on top\nI want you to do is really build on top of what we just covered. Instead of two\nof what we just covered. Instead of two\nof what we just covered. Instead of two nodes, I want you to build three nodes.\nnodes, I want you to build three nodes.\nnodes, I want you to build three nodes. Again, in a sequence, don't need to go\nAgain, in a sequence, don't need to go\nAgain, in a sequence, don't need to go too fancy yet. We will again three nodes\ntoo fancy yet. We will again three nodes\ntoo fancy yet. We will again three nodes in a sequence. And we will have you will\nin a sequence. And we will have you will\nin a sequence. And we will have you will need to accept the user's name, their\nneed to accept the user's name, their\nneed to accept the user's name, their age, and a list of their skills. So the\nage, and a list of their skills. So the\nage, and a list of their skills. So the first node will be specifically for\nfirst node will be specifically for\nfirst node will be specifically for personalizing the name field with a\npersonalizing the name field with a\npersonalizing the name field with a greeting. The second node will be\ngreeting. The second node will be\ngreeting. The second node will be describing the user's age. The third\ndescribing the user's age. The third\ndescribing the user's age. The third node will be listing all of the user\nnode will be listing all of the user\nnode will be listing all of the user skill in a formatted string. And then\nskill in a formatted string. And then\nskill in a formatted string. And then you'll need to combine this and uh store\nyou'll need to combine this and uh store\nyou'll need to combine this and uh store it in a result field and output that.\nit in a result field and output that.\nit in a result field and output that. And this should be a combined message.\nAnd this should be a combined message.\nAnd this should be a combined message. And the format I would like you to\nAnd the format I would like you to\nAnd the format I would like you to output is something like this. So let's\noutput is something like this. So let's\noutput is something like this. So let's say the name was Linda. And let's say\nsay the name was Linda. And let's say\nsay the name was Linda. And let's say Linda welcome to the system. You are 31\nLinda welcome to the system. You are 31\nLinda welcome to the system. You are 31 years old and you have skills in Python,\nyears old and you have skills in Python,\nyears old and you have skills in Python, machine learning and langraph. Okay. And\nmachine learning and langraph. Okay. And\nmachine learning and langraph. Okay. And just as a hint for this exercise, I\njust as a hint for this exercise, I\njust as a hint for this exercise, I would you'll need to use the add edge\nwould you'll need to use the add edge\nwould you'll need to use the add edge method twice. So this will really\nmethod twice. So this will really\nmethod twice. So this will really solidify your understanding on how to\nsolidify your understanding on how to\nsolidify your understanding on how to build graphs in general. All right,\nbuild graphs in general. All right,\nbuild graphs in general. All right, cool. So once you've done that, again,\ncool. So once you've done that, again,\ncool. So once you've done that, again, answers will be on GitHub for all of the\nanswers will be on GitHub for all of the\nanswers will be on GitHub for all of the exercises. Once you have uh cross\nexercises. Once you have uh cross\nexercises. Once you have uh cross referenced and checked that you've done\nreferenced and checked that you've done\nreferenced and checked that you've done it right, I will see you in the next\nit right, I will see you in the next\nit right, I will see you in the next section where we build our fourth graph.\nsection where we build our fourth graph.\nsection where we build our fourth graph. All right, see you\nAll right, see you\nAll right, see you there. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Okay,\nthere. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Okay,\nthere. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Okay, I'm particularly excited for uh teaching\nI'm particularly excited for uh teaching\nI'm particularly excited for uh teaching you this graph, graph 4. Why? Because\nyou this graph, graph 4. Why? Because\nyou this graph, graph 4. Why? Because we're about to learn how to build a\nwe're about to learn how to build a\nwe're about to learn how to build a conditional graph. So for the very first\nconditional graph. So for the very first\nconditional graph. So for the very first time, we're about to implement\ntime, we're about to implement\ntime, we're about to implement conditional logic. And obviously we've\nconditional logic. And obviously we've\nconditional logic. And obviously we've done it in a previous exercise before\ndone it in a previous exercise before\ndone it in a previous exercise before but that was within a single node. This\nbut that was within a single node. This\nbut that was within a single node. This is how to implement conditional logic in\nis how to implement conditional logic in\nis how to implement conditional logic in the overall graph structure. And so we\nthe overall graph structure. And so we\nthe overall graph structure. And so we will be implementing conditional logic\nwill be implementing conditional logic\nwill be implementing conditional logic to route the uh flow of data to\nto route the uh flow of data to\nto route the uh flow of data to different nodes. We will be using the\ndifferent nodes. We will be using the\ndifferent nodes. We will be using the start and the end nodes to manage entry\nstart and the end nodes to manage entry\nstart and the end nodes to manage entry and exit points. We will be designing\nand exit points. We will be designing\nand exit points. We will be designing again using multiple nodes to perform\nagain using multiple nodes to perform\nagain using multiple nodes to perform different operations such as addition\ndifferent operations such as addition\ndifferent operations such as addition and subtraction. And we will be able to\nand subtraction. And we will be able to\nand subtraction. And we will be able to create a router node to handle\ncreate a router node to handle\ncreate a router node to handle decision-m and control the graph flow.\ndecision-m and control the graph flow.\ndecision-m and control the graph flow. So the main goal is really to you how we\nSo the main goal is really to you how we\nSo the main goal is really to you how we can use this inbuilt function which uh\ncan use this inbuilt function which uh\ncan use this inbuilt function which uh allows you to create conditional edges\nallows you to create conditional edges\nallows you to create conditional edges in langraph. All right, exciting stuff.\nin langraph. All right, exciting stuff.\nin langraph. All right, exciting stuff. I'll see you at the\ncode. Okay, so let's actually code this\ncode. Okay, so let's actually code this up now and you'll see the imports are\nup now and you'll see the imports are\nup now and you'll see the imports are slightly modified this time. Again, type\nslightly modified this time. Again, type\nslightly modified this time. Again, type dictionary and state graph is there. But\ndictionary and state graph is there. But\ndictionary and state graph is there. But now I've also imported start and end\nnow I've also imported start and end\nnow I've also imported start and end point. Again, if you remember a few\npoint. Again, if you remember a few\npoint. Again, if you remember a few subsections ago, I told you there are\nsubsections ago, I told you there are\nsubsections ago, I told you there are multiple ways to be able to initialize\nmultiple ways to be able to initialize\nmultiple ways to be able to initialize the start and the end point. And this is\nthe start and the end point. And this is\nthe start and the end point. And this is another way you could. Arguably, this is\nanother way you could. Arguably, this is\nanother way you could. Arguably, this is the easier way, but um whatever. I don't\nthe easier way, but um whatever. I don't\nthe easier way, but um whatever. I don't really have a preference, but I'll teach\nreally have a preference, but I'll teach\nreally have a preference, but I'll teach you both ways regardless. Okay, let's\nyou both ways regardless. Okay, let's\nyou both ways regardless. Okay, let's import these. Successful. Okay. like\nimport these. Successful. Okay. like\nimport these. Successful. Okay. like standard procedure we will design we\nstandard procedure we will design we\nstandard procedure we will design we will um code up the uh the schema the\nwill um code up the uh the schema the\nwill um code up the uh the schema the state schema so class agent state and\nstate schema so class agent state and\nstate schema so class agent state and let's again type dictionary in this case\nlet's again type dictionary in this case\nlet's again type dictionary in this case uh uh I want to be able to pass in two\nuh uh I want to be able to pass in two\nuh uh I want to be able to pass in two numbers and pass in an operation so a\nnumbers and pass in an operation so a\nnumbers and pass in an operation so a plus operation and a minus operation one\nplus operation and a minus operation one\nplus operation and a minus operation one of those two operations now obviously I\nof those two operations now obviously I\nof those two operations now obviously I could have handled uh all of this within\ncould have handled uh all of this within\ncould have handled uh all of this within one single node But that's not the point\none single node But that's not the point\none single node But that's not the point here. I've kept it deliberately very\nhere. I've kept it deliberately very\nhere. I've kept it deliberately very very simple. So the main concept which\nvery simple. So the main concept which\nvery simple. So the main concept which you learn is how to uh implement\nyou learn is how to uh implement\nyou learn is how to uh implement conditional logic. Okay.\nconditional logic. Okay.\nconditional logic. Okay. So let's code the different uh keys\nSo let's code the different uh keys\nSo let's code the different uh keys which we require. So number one will be\nwhich we require. So number one will be\nwhich we require. So number one will be an integer. Operation will be in the\nan integer. Operation will be in the\nan integer. Operation will be in the string a plus or a minus. Uh number two\nstring a plus or a minus. Uh number two\nstring a plus or a minus. Uh number two will be an integer and final number will\nwill be an integer and final number will\nwill be an integer and final number will be an integer. the final number will be\nbe an integer. the final number will be\nbe an integer. the final number will be the result of either adding or\nthe result of either adding or\nthe result of either adding or subtracting the two\nsubtracting the two\nsubtracting the two numbers. Easy enough. We've done this\nnumbers. Easy enough. We've done this\nnumbers. Easy enough. We've done this multiple times now. Okay. Now, here's\nmultiple times now. Okay. Now, here's\nmultiple times now. Okay. Now, here's where things get interesting. Now, just\nwhere things get interesting. Now, just\nwhere things get interesting. Now, just a heads up. Initially, this won't make\na heads up. Initially, this won't make\na heads up. Initially, this won't make sense. But when we look at it from a\nsense. But when we look at it from a\nsense. But when we look at it from a bird's eye view and we look back at all\nbird's eye view and we look back at all\nbird's eye view and we look back at all the code in this subsection again, uh\nthe code in this subsection again, uh\nthe code in this subsection again, uh everything will start to click. So\neverything will start to click. So\neverything will start to click. So again, it won't make sense initially,\nagain, it won't make sense initially,\nagain, it won't make sense initially, but it will once we look at it. Uh\nbut it will once we look at it. Uh\nbut it will once we look at it. Uh again, don't worry. All right. So let's\nagain, don't worry. All right. So let's\nagain, don't worry. All right. So let's create our first node function. Let's\ncreate our first node function. Let's\ncreate our first node function. Let's call it adder. And it's again still a\ncall it adder. And it's again still a\ncall it adder. And it's again still a node. And we input the state schema. And\nnode. And we input the state schema. And\nnode. And we input the state schema. And we return the updated state schema and\nwe return the updated state schema and\nwe return the updated state schema and dock string again. But uh this time I'm\ndock string again. But uh this time I'm\ndock string again. But uh this time I'm just going to copy it from here. Uh it's\njust going to copy it from here. Uh it's\njust going to copy it from here. Uh it's tells exactly what it does. This node\ntells exactly what it does. This node\ntells exactly what it does. This node adds the two numbers. Uh and easy\nadds the two numbers. Uh and easy\nadds the two numbers. Uh and easy enough, we just do state final number is\nenough, we just do state final number is\nenough, we just do state final number is equal to state uh number one plus\nequal to state uh number one plus\nequal to state uh number one plus state number two. Okay. And we just\nstate number two. Okay. And we just\nstate number two. Okay. And we just return the\nreturn the\nreturn the state. Quite simple, right? And just\nstate. Quite simple, right? And just\nstate. Quite simple, right? And just like what we did with the addition, we\nlike what we did with the addition, we\nlike what we did with the addition, we need a node for subtraction as well. So\nneed a node for subtraction as well. So\nneed a node for subtraction as well. So def subtractor. Now uh I already\ndef subtractor. Now uh I already\ndef subtractor. Now uh I already implemented it to uh don't to not waste\nimplemented it to uh don't to not waste\nimplemented it to uh don't to not waste time but this node subtracts the two\ntime but this node subtracts the two\ntime but this node subtracts the two numbers. It's very similar to the\nnumbers. It's very similar to the\nnumbers. It's very similar to the previous uh node function. Uh it just\nprevious uh node function. Uh it just\nprevious uh node function. Uh it just subtracts these two numbers. Again yes\nsubtracts these two numbers. Again yes\nsubtracts these two numbers. Again yes you could be saying what if number one\nyou could be saying what if number one\nyou could be saying what if number one is uh smaller than number two it'll give\nis uh smaller than number two it'll give\nis uh smaller than number two it'll give you a negative result. It that doesn't\nyou a negative result. It that doesn't\nyou a negative result. It that doesn't matter. The main aim again was to\nmatter. The main aim again was to\nmatter. The main aim again was to implement the conditional logic not the\nimplement the conditional logic not the\nimplement the conditional logic not the um inner workings of each node. Okay.\num inner workings of each node. Okay.\num inner workings of each node. Okay. Okay. Now we built another type of node.\nOkay. Now we built another type of node.\nOkay. Now we built another type of node. Uh and we initialize it the same way but\nUh and we initialize it the same way but\nUh and we initialize it the same way but this time let's call this node decide\nthis time let's call this node decide\nthis time let's call this node decide next node. Let's actually give it a name\nnext node. Let's actually give it a name\nnext node. Let's actually give it a name which actually says what it does. Right.\nwhich actually says what it does. Right.\nwhich actually says what it does. Right. So again we use state agent state and we\nSo again we use state agent state and we\nSo again we use state agent state and we pass like this. Perfect. Okay. Now the\npass like this. Perfect. Okay. Now the\npass like this. Perfect. Okay. Now the dock string will be something like so.\ndock string will be something like so.\ndock string will be something like so. So this node will select the next phase\nSo this node will select the next phase\nSo this node will select the next phase of the graph or well next node of the\nof the graph or well next node of the\nof the graph or well next node of the graph I should say.\ngraph I should say.\ngraph I should say. Okay. Now we use an if statement and\nOkay. Now we use an if statement and\nOkay. Now we use an if statement and before I code something let's just try\nbefore I code something let's just try\nbefore I code something let's just try to map how this will work. This specific\nto map how this will work. This specific\nto map how this will work. This specific node will be at the start of our uh\nnode will be at the start of our uh\nnode will be at the start of our uh graph. So we will have the start node.\ngraph. So we will have the start node.\ngraph. So we will have the start node. We will have this uh this specific node\nWe will have this uh this specific node\nWe will have this uh this specific node we'll call it the router. and this\nwe'll call it the router. and this\nwe'll call it the router. and this router because it routes uh the next uh\nrouter because it routes uh the next uh\nrouter because it routes uh the next uh to the next node depending on what the\nto the next node depending on what the\nto the next node depending on what the state schema is at that point. So we\nstate schema is at that point. So we\nstate schema is at that point. So we will have the uh I will put an image up\nwill have the uh I will put an image up\nwill have the uh I will put an image up right now so you kind of get what I'm\nright now so you kind of get what I'm\nright now so you kind of get what I'm trying to say but we essentially will\ntrying to say but we essentially will\ntrying to say but we essentially will have the router decide whether we uh add\nhave the router decide whether we uh add\nhave the router decide whether we uh add the two numbers and subtract the two\nthe two numbers and subtract the two\nthe two numbers and subtract the two numbers and obviously this will be\nnumbers and obviously this will be\nnumbers and obviously this will be decided with the operation uh attribute\ndecided with the operation uh attribute\ndecided with the operation uh attribute right which you should see from here.\nright which you should see from here.\nright which you should see from here. Okay, let's code this up now. So this is\nOkay, let's code this up now. So this is\nOkay, let's code this up now. So this is not the hard part. If state operation,\nnot the hard part. If state operation,\nnot the hard part. If state operation, if I can spell if state operation is\nif I can spell if state operation is\nif I can spell if state operation is equal to equal to\nplus. Okay, if state operation is equal\nplus. Okay, if state operation is equal to equal to\nto equal to\nto equal to plus, we need to do a certain thing to\nplus, we need to do a certain thing to\nplus, we need to do a certain thing to pass it to the next node. Okay, now\npass it to the next node. Okay, now\npass it to the next node. Okay, now here's well your first guess could be\nhere's well your first guess could be\nhere's well your first guess could be okay. Well, we guess I guess just call\nokay. Well, we guess I guess just call\nokay. Well, we guess I guess just call this function, right? Not exactly. Not\nthis function, right? Not exactly. Not\nthis function, right? Not exactly. Not in langraph. You actually return\nin langraph. You actually return\nin langraph. You actually return uh return the edge. Now, we haven't\nuh return the edge. Now, we haven't\nuh return the edge. Now, we haven't described the edge yet, right? But for\ndescribed the edge yet, right? But for\ndescribed the edge yet, right? But for now, I will just say the edg's name is\nnow, I will just say the edg's name is\nnow, I will just say the edg's name is addition operation. So, addition\naddition operation. So, addition\naddition operation. So, addition operation. Similarly, if it's\noperation. Similarly, if it's\noperation. Similarly, if it's subtraction, we will do this like so. So\nsubtraction, we will do this like so. So\nsubtraction, we will do this like so. So just to reiterate we will uh you we will\njust to reiterate we will uh you we will\njust to reiterate we will uh you we will see what the um value is at the\nsee what the um value is at the\nsee what the um value is at the operation in the state schema. If it's a\noperation in the state schema. If it's a\noperation in the state schema. If it's a plus we call we will return the edge\nplus we call we will return the edge\nplus we call we will return the edge addition operation and if it's a\naddition operation and if it's a\naddition operation and if it's a subtraction we will use the subtraction\nsubtraction we will use the subtraction\nsubtraction we will use the subtraction operation edge. Again we haven't\noperation edge. Again we haven't\noperation edge. Again we haven't described or defined these two edges\ndescribed or defined these two edges\ndescribed or defined these two edges yet. That's what I was saying earlier.\nyet. That's what I was saying earlier.\nyet. That's what I was saying earlier. When we look at it from the bird's eye\nWhen we look at it from the bird's eye\nWhen we look at it from the bird's eye view later on in a few moments once\nview later on in a few moments once\nview later on in a few moments once we've built everything it will make much\nwe've built everything it will make much\nwe've built everything it will make much more sense. So stick with me for now.\nmore sense. So stick with me for now.\nmore sense. So stick with me for now. Okay. And runs perfect. Now we build the\nOkay. And runs perfect. Now we build the\nOkay. And runs perfect. Now we build the graph. And now here's the exciting part.\ngraph. And now here's the exciting part.\ngraph. And now here's the exciting part. So we again like normal standard\nSo we again like normal standard\nSo we again like normal standard procedure we use state graph to create\nprocedure we use state graph to create\nprocedure we use state graph to create the graph framework. So graph is equal\nthe graph framework. So graph is equal\nthe graph framework. So graph is equal to\nto\nto that. And let's add these nodes uh to\nthat. And let's add these nodes uh to\nthat. And let's add these nodes uh to the\nthe\nthe uh to our graph. So graph add\nuh to our graph. So graph add\nuh to our graph. So graph add node and let's say\nnode and let's say\nnode and let's say router. Okay. And again we will pass\nrouter. Okay. And again we will pass\nrouter. Okay. And again we will pass this decide next node. Perfect.\nthis decide next node. Perfect.\nthis decide next node. Perfect. Okay. Now I have another confession to\nOkay. Now I have another confession to\nOkay. Now I have another confession to make. Lots of conventions. I know this\nmake. Lots of conventions. I know this\nmake. Lots of conventions. I know this won't work. I know I haven't built the\nwon't work. I know I haven't built the\nwon't work. I know I haven't built the rest of the graph yet but this\nrest of the graph yet but this\nrest of the graph yet but this eventually will not work. And there is a\neventually will not work. And there is a\neventually will not work. And there is a subtle reason why this won't work. You\nsubtle reason why this won't work. You\nsubtle reason why this won't work. You know, it's mainly in this line. Add node\nknow, it's mainly in this line. Add node\nknow, it's mainly in this line. Add node router decide next node. The problem is\nrouter decide next node. The problem is\nrouter decide next node. The problem is with decide next node cuz oh, you can\nwith decide next node cuz oh, you can\nwith decide next node cuz oh, you can see that the dock string appears once we\nsee that the dock string appears once we\nsee that the dock string appears once we press uh the decide next node. But the\npress uh the decide next node. But the\npress uh the decide next node. But the reason this won't work is look closely\nreason this won't work is look closely\nreason this won't work is look closely at these three functions. What are we\nat these three functions. What are we\nat these three functions. What are we doing in these two functions that we're\ndoing in these two functions that we're\ndoing in these two functions that we're not doing in this?\nnot doing in this?\nnot doing in this? I'll give you a moment to try to analyze\nthis. Okay. So, doesn't matter if don't\nthis. Okay. So, doesn't matter if don't worry if you didn't get that. The\nworry if you didn't get that. The\nworry if you didn't get that. The correct answer is we are returning this\ncorrect answer is we are returning this\ncorrect answer is we are returning this updated state in this one and this one.\nupdated state in this one and this one.\nupdated state in this one and this one. But in this node, we're not. We're just\nBut in this node, we're not. We're just\nBut in this node, we're not. We're just returning the edge. Subtle difference I\nreturning the edge. Subtle difference I\nreturning the edge. Subtle difference I know but that's how Lang graph works and\nknow but that's how Lang graph works and\nknow but that's how Lang graph works and you will see why they do it like that\nyou will see why they do it like that\nyou will see why they do it like that uh right now. So how do we deal with\nuh right now. So how do we deal with\nuh right now. So how do we deal with this? Now I obviously could have built\nthis? Now I obviously could have built\nthis? Now I obviously could have built this graph and then I would have shown\nthis graph and then I would have shown\nthis graph and then I would have shown you the error but then things would have\nyou the error but then things would have\nyou the error but then things would have just gotten messy. That's why from the\njust gotten messy. That's why from the\njust gotten messy. That's why from the get- go I have told you why this\nget- go I have told you why this\nget- go I have told you why this wouldn't work. So now that you know why\nwouldn't work. So now that you know why\nwouldn't work. So now that you know why this won't work, how do you fix this?\nthis won't work, how do you fix this?\nthis won't work, how do you fix this? Simple. You use this code lambda\nSimple. You use this code lambda\nSimple. You use this code lambda state. Now, if you have used lambda\nstate. Now, if you have used lambda\nstate. Now, if you have used lambda functions before, this is quite easy to\nfunctions before, this is quite easy to\nfunctions before, this is quite easy to understand. If you haven't, don't worry.\nunderstand. If you haven't, don't worry.\nunderstand. If you haven't, don't worry. All this is saying is your input state\nAll this is saying is your input state\nAll this is saying is your input state will be your output state. That's it. In\nwill be your output state. That's it. In\nwill be your output state. That's it. In even more simpler words, think of this\neven more simpler words, think of this\neven more simpler words, think of this as a pass through\nas a pass through\nas a pass through function. So, what it's saying is your\nfunction. So, what it's saying is your\nfunction. So, what it's saying is your input state will be passed, your state\ninput state will be passed, your state\ninput state will be passed, your state will be inputed and your output will be\nwill be inputed and your output will be\nwill be inputed and your output will be the exact same state. Now, why is it the\nthe exact same state. Now, why is it the\nthe exact same state. Now, why is it the exact same state? because you're not\nexact same state? because you're not\nexact same state? because you're not changing the state at all. You're\nchanging the state at all. You're\nchanging the state at all. You're comparing stuff here, but you're not\ncomparing stuff here, but you're not\ncomparing stuff here, but you're not assigning anything. There's a difference\nassigning anything. There's a difference\nassigning anything. There's a difference between comparison and um and\nbetween comparison and um and\nbetween comparison and um and assignment. Right? Again, even in this\nassignment. Right? Again, even in this\nassignment. Right? Again, even in this one, you're just comparing to see\none, you're just comparing to see\none, you're just comparing to see whether the operation is a minus, but no\nwhether the operation is a minus, but no\nwhether the operation is a minus, but no assignments been made at all. In fact,\nassignments been made at all. In fact,\nassignments been made at all. In fact, there's been no changes to this state\nthere's been no changes to this state\nthere's been no changes to this state whatsoever. That's why we can use this\nwhatsoever. That's why we can use this\nwhatsoever. That's why we can use this as a pass through\nas a pass through\nas a pass through function. Now, hopefully that made\nfunction. Now, hopefully that made\nfunction. Now, hopefully that made sense.\nsense.\nsense. Okay, let's continue. Again, we will get\nOkay, let's continue. Again, we will get\nOkay, let's continue. Again, we will get a lot more practice. Don't worry, this\na lot more practice. Don't worry, this\na lot more practice. Don't worry, this is the first time you're seeing this.\nis the first time you're seeing this.\nis the first time you're seeing this. Okay, so now we will add the edge. And\nOkay, so now we will add the edge. And\nOkay, so now we will add the edge. And this is just the normal edge we did last\nthis is just the normal edge we did last\nthis is just the normal edge we did last time. So, we will need the start key.\ntime. So, we will need the start key.\ntime. So, we will need the start key. And now here's how you initialize\nAnd now here's how you initialize\nAnd now here's how you initialize differently. Remember how we used to do\ndifferently. Remember how we used to do\ndifferently. Remember how we used to do set entry point and set finish point? We\nset entry point and set finish point? We\nset entry point and set finish point? We don't do that anymore. Uh we use start\ndon't do that anymore. Uh we use start\ndon't do that anymore. Uh we use start the keyword cuz that's what we imported.\nthe keyword cuz that's what we imported.\nthe keyword cuz that's what we imported. Make sure to import it if you do it this\nMake sure to import it if you do it this\nMake sure to import it if you do it this way. uh you use start and end. So your\nway. uh you use start and end. So your\nway. uh you use start and end. So your start will be a start point and your\nstart will be a start point and your\nstart will be a start point and your what do you want the start to be\nwhat do you want the start to be\nwhat do you want the start to be connected to? Well, we want it to be\nconnected to? Well, we want it to be\nconnected to? Well, we want it to be connected to the\nconnected to the\nconnected to the router. If I put this in quotation\nrouter. If I put this in quotation\nrouter. If I put this in quotation marks, perfect. Now, why not add node or\nmarks, perfect. Now, why not add node or\nmarks, perfect. Now, why not add node or subtract node? Well, think again. Refer\nsubtract node? Well, think again. Refer\nsubtract node? Well, think again. Refer back to that diagram which I'll show in\nback to that diagram which I'll show in\nback to that diagram which I'll show in right here.\nright here.\nright here. We if we connected the start point to\nWe if we connected the start point to\nWe if we connected the start point to the the add node or the subtract node,\nthe the add node or the subtract node,\nthe the add node or the subtract node, well then what's the point of the router\nwell then what's the point of the router\nwell then what's the point of the router in the first place, right? The whole\nin the first place, right? The whole\nin the first place, right? The whole point was the router decides what the\npoint was the router decides what the\npoint was the router decides what the inputs are and then from there it\ninputs are and then from there it\ninputs are and then from there it branches off to the correct node. So\nbranches off to the correct node. So\nbranches off to the correct node. So that's why the router needs to be the\nthat's why the router needs to be the\nthat's why the router needs to be the first node we uh connect our start point\nfirst node we uh connect our start point\nfirst node we uh connect our start point to. Cool.\nto. Cool.\nto. Cool. Okay. Perfect. Now we add the we now\nOkay. Perfect. Now we add the we now\nOkay. Perfect. Now we add the we now implement the main the new thing which\nimplement the main the new thing which\nimplement the main the new thing which we are going to learn in this section is\nwe are going to learn in this section is\nwe are going to learn in this section is graph dot add conditional edge. So graph\ngraph dot add conditional edge. So graph\ngraph dot add conditional edge. So graph dot add conditional\ndot add conditional\ndot add conditional edges. Now again wow looks really\nedges. Now again wow looks really\nedges. Now again wow looks really confusing but it's actually much more\nconfusing but it's actually much more\nconfusing but it's actually much more simpler than it looks\nsimpler than it looks\nsimpler than it looks like. So the first uh part is your\nlike. So the first uh part is your\nlike. So the first uh part is your source which you can see here as well.\nsource which you can see here as well.\nsource which you can see here as well. So the source will just simply be the\nSo the source will just simply be the\nSo the source will just simply be the name of the node. And what's the name of\nname of the node. And what's the name of\nname of the node. And what's the name of the node which we want the conditional\nthe node which we want the conditional\nthe node which we want the conditional edge to be? It's the router node, right?\nedge to be? It's the router node, right?\nedge to be? It's the router node, right? So that's going to be the source part.\nSo that's going to be the source part.\nSo that's going to be the source part. Perfect. Now if you look here, it's\nPerfect. Now if you look here, it's\nPerfect. Now if you look here, it's asking for a path. What's the path you\nasking for a path. What's the path you\nasking for a path. What's the path you would like it to do? Now before we\nwould like it to do? Now before we\nwould like it to do? Now before we implement the path, we obviously need to\nimplement the path, we obviously need to\nimplement the path, we obviously need to per uh imple uh tell it what action what\nper uh imple uh tell it what action what\nper uh imple uh tell it what action what what action it needs to do. And that's\nwhat action it needs to do. And that's\nwhat action it needs to do. And that's where this node will come in the decide\nwhere this node will come in the decide\nwhere this node will come in the decide next node part. So we pass that as the\nnext node part. So we pass that as the\nnext node part. So we pass that as the second parameter. So that's the\nsecond parameter. So that's the\nsecond parameter. So that's the path. And now we implement something\npath. And now we implement something\npath. And now we implement something called the path map which you should\ncalled the path map which you should\ncalled the path map which you should have briefly saw\nhave briefly saw\nhave briefly saw here. Uh there path map. So we've\nhere. Uh there path map. So we've\nhere. Uh there path map. So we've implemented the source which is the\nimplemented the source which is the\nimplemented the source which is the router. We've implemented the path which\nrouter. We've implemented the path which\nrouter. We've implemented the path which is your uh decide next node function. Uh\nis your uh decide next node function. Uh\nis your uh decide next node function. Uh again don't need to worry about hashable\nagain don't need to worry about hashable\nagain don't need to worry about hashable runnable any and all of this stuff.\nrunnable any and all of this stuff.\nrunnable any and all of this stuff. Okay, it's you don't need to over\nOkay, it's you don't need to over\nOkay, it's you don't need to over complicate it. Now it's time for the\ncomplicate it. Now it's time for the\ncomplicate it. Now it's time for the path map. Okay, so now your path map\npath map. Okay, so now your path map\npath map. Okay, so now your path map will be in a form of a dictionary. And\nwill be in a form of a dictionary. And\nwill be in a form of a dictionary. And remember how I said earlier that we had\nremember how I said earlier that we had\nremember how I said earlier that we had implemented addition operation and\nimplemented addition operation and\nimplemented addition operation and subtraction operation. These were edges.\nsubtraction operation. These were edges.\nsubtraction operation. These were edges. So now we're about to implement those\nSo now we're about to implement those\nSo now we're about to implement those only. So we're about to create two new\nonly. So we're about to create two new\nonly. So we're about to create two new edges here. Let me just write this code\nedges here. Let me just write this code\nedges here. Let me just write this code up for you and then it will make sense.\nup for you and then it will make sense.\nup for you and then it will make sense. Give me one second.\nOkay, so there we go. Now what is this\nOkay, so there we go. Now what is this code actually saying? Well, this is in a\ncode actually saying? Well, this is in a\ncode actually saying? Well, this is in a format of\nformat of\nformat of edge and\nedge and\nedge and node. Now the starting point of this\nnode. Now the starting point of this\nnode. Now the starting point of this edge will obviously be this router node\nedge will obviously be this router node\nedge will obviously be this router node and it's telling us where it will\nand it's telling us where it will\nand it's telling us where it will connect to. This uh visualization will\nconnect to. This uh visualization will\nconnect to. This uh visualization will be it will be it'll be much easier to\nbe it will be it'll be much easier to\nbe it will be it'll be much easier to visualize when I actually show you the\nvisualize when I actually show you the\nvisualize when I actually show you the graph. Don't worry. But for now,\ngraph. Don't worry. But for now,\ngraph. Don't worry. But for now, addition operation and subtraction\naddition operation and subtraction\naddition operation and subtraction operation is the edge. And the two nodes\noperation is the edge. And the two nodes\noperation is the edge. And the two nodes are add node and subtract node. Right?\nare add node and subtract node. Right?\nare add node and subtract node. Right? Okay. Uh lastly, we now we're now at the\nOkay. Uh lastly, we now we're now at the\nOkay. Uh lastly, we now we're now at the point where we need to create the end\npoint where we need to create the end\npoint where we need to create the end point. But obviously, we if you look\npoint. But obviously, we if you look\npoint. But obviously, we if you look back at this diagram which I've shown on\nback at this diagram which I've shown on\nback at this diagram which I've shown on the screen right now, you can see that\nthe screen right now, you can see that\nthe screen right now, you can see that the we need two edges to connect to the\nthe we need two edges to connect to the\nthe we need two edges to connect to the end point, right? We need to we need an\nend point, right? We need to we need an\nend point, right? We need to we need an edge from the and node and we need an\nedge from the and node and we need an\nedge from the and node and we need an edge from the subtract node. So we can\nedge from the subtract node. So we can\nedge from the subtract node. So we can add two edges like this. graph\nadd two edges like this. graph\nadd two edges like this. graph edge. Uh we uh start at the add node and\nedge. Uh we uh start at the add node and\nedge. Uh we uh start at the add node and then we end at the endpoint. Again\nthen we end at the endpoint. Again\nthen we end at the endpoint. Again similar subtract node and endpoint. And\nsimilar subtract node and endpoint. And\nsimilar subtract node and endpoint. And then we just compile this. So app is\nthen we just compile this. So app is\nthen we just compile this. So app is equal to\ngraph.compile. Cool. No errors. Okay.\ngraph.compile. Cool. No errors. Okay. Now here comes the most exciting part.\nNow here comes the most exciting part.\nNow here comes the most exciting part. Again try to visualize what this graph\nAgain try to visualize what this graph\nAgain try to visualize what this graph will actually look\nwill actually look\nwill actually look like. Okay. So it should look something\nlike. Okay. So it should look something\nlike. Okay. So it should look something like\nlike\nlike that. Probably slightly different to\nthat. Probably slightly different to\nthat. Probably slightly different to what you initially anticipated but\nwhat you initially anticipated but\nwhat you initially anticipated but that's okay. We again have a start\nthat's okay. We again have a start\nthat's okay. We again have a start point. We have the router and we have\npoint. We have the router and we have\npoint. We have the router and we have the our two nodes add node subtract\nthe our two nodes add node subtract\nthe our two nodes add node subtract node. And notice remember when I said\nnode. And notice remember when I said\nnode. And notice remember when I said addition operation and subtraction\naddition operation and subtraction\naddition operation and subtraction operation are the edges names. Well,\noperation are the edges names. Well,\noperation are the edges names. Well, here it is. Addition operation and\nhere it is. Addition operation and\nhere it is. Addition operation and subtraction operation. It's telling us\nsubtraction operation. It's telling us\nsubtraction operation. It's telling us uh what the which direction to go into.\nuh what the which direction to go into.\nuh what the which direction to go into. Do we go how do we go to add node? Well,\nDo we go how do we go to add node? Well,\nDo we go how do we go to add node? Well, we use the addition operation. How do we\nwe use the addition operation. How do we\nwe use the addition operation. How do we go to subtract node? Well, we go to the\ngo to subtract node? Well, we go to the\ngo to subtract node? Well, we go to the subtract operation. And then obviously\nsubtract operation. And then obviously\nsubtract operation. And then obviously we create these two\nwe create these two\nwe create these two edges, these two to connect to the\nedges, these two to connect to the\nedges, these two to connect to the endpoint. Awesome. So, we will once\nendpoint. Awesome. So, we will once\nendpoint. Awesome. So, we will once again look at it from a bird's eye view.\nagain look at it from a bird's eye view.\nagain look at it from a bird's eye view. But let's actually invoke this graph to\nBut let's actually invoke this graph to\nBut let's actually invoke this graph to see what happens.\nsee what happens.\nsee what happens. So let's use this piece of code. So what\nSo let's use this piece of code. So what\nSo let's use this piece of code. So what it's saying is it's defining number one\nit's saying is it's defining number one\nit's saying is it's defining number one as 10, operation as minus and number two\nas 10, operation as minus and number two\nas 10, operation as minus and number two as five. So because we've used\nas five. So because we've used\nas five. So because we've used subtraction, the final number should be\nsubtraction, the final number should be\nsubtraction, the final number should be 10 - 5 which is five. And we've printed\n10 - 5 which is five. And we've printed\n10 - 5 which is five. And we've printed the results and the answer is like such.\nthe results and the answer is like such.\nthe results and the answer is like such. Uh number one is equal to 10, operation\nUh number one is equal to 10, operation\nUh number one is equal to 10, operation is equal to minus, number two is equal\nis equal to minus, number two is equal\nis equal to minus, number two is equal to 5 and final number is uh five.\nto 5 and final number is uh five.\nto 5 and final number is uh five. Obviously the way I've invoked it is\nObviously the way I've invoked it is\nObviously the way I've invoked it is slightly different to what I have done\nslightly different to what I have done\nslightly different to what I have done before. Again, this is another way you\nbefore. Again, this is another way you\nbefore. Again, this is another way you can\ncan\ncan invoke. Okay, so not too hard. But let's\ninvoke. Okay, so not too hard. But let's\ninvoke. Okay, so not too hard. But let's just go through everything one more time\njust go through everything one more time\njust go through everything one more time to solidify everything. Okay, so we\nto solidify everything. Okay, so we\nto solidify everything. Okay, so we imported everything. We created the\nimported everything. We created the\nimported everything. We created the state schema using agent state and a\nstate schema using agent state and a\nstate schema using agent state and a type dictionary. Then we created our\ntype dictionary. Then we created our\ntype dictionary. Then we created our three different nodes which is the add\nthree different nodes which is the add\nthree different nodes which is the add node, subtract node and the decide next\nnode, subtract node and the decide next\nnode, subtract node and the decide next node. And this is in within the decide\nnode. And this is in within the decide\nnode. And this is in within the decide next node. You can see that if the\nnext node. You can see that if the\nnext node. You can see that if the operation is a plus, it goes to the\noperation is a plus, it goes to the\noperation is a plus, it goes to the addition operation edge which is this\naddition operation edge which is this\naddition operation edge which is this edge. And if it's subtraction operation,\nedge. And if it's subtraction operation,\nedge. And if it's subtraction operation, it goes to this side. And this is how we\nit goes to this side. And this is how we\nit goes to this side. And this is how we built the graph. We added the nodes. We\nbuilt the graph. We added the nodes. We\nbuilt the graph. We added the nodes. We added the edge from the start point uh\nadded the edge from the start point uh\nadded the edge from the start point uh to the router. And then we added the\nto the router. And then we added the\nto the router. And then we added the conditional edge. the new thing which\nconditional edge. the new thing which\nconditional edge. the new thing which we've learned in this section uh which\nwe've learned in this section uh which\nwe've learned in this section uh which is we uh reference router and we use the\nis we uh reference router and we use the\nis we uh reference router and we use the edge node format. So the edge will be\nedge node format. So the edge will be\nedge node format. So the edge will be addition operation uh to add node then\naddition operation uh to add node then\naddition operation uh to add node then it will be subtraction operation to\nit will be subtraction operation to\nit will be subtraction operation to subtract node. Visually speaking it will\nsubtract node. Visually speaking it will\nsubtract node. Visually speaking it will be addition operation to add node\nbe addition operation to add node\nbe addition operation to add node subtraction operation to subtract node.\nsubtraction operation to subtract node.\nsubtraction operation to subtract node. Now, I know this will be quite confusing\nNow, I know this will be quite confusing\nNow, I know this will be quite confusing at first and don't worry, it took me\nat first and don't worry, it took me\nat first and don't worry, it took me quite a while to understand this myself\nquite a while to understand this myself\nquite a while to understand this myself as well, but hopefully the exercise I've\nas well, but hopefully the exercise I've\nas well, but hopefully the exercise I've given you will really be able to help\ngiven you will really be able to help\ngiven you will really be able to help you understand this much better. Okay,\nyou understand this much better. Okay,\nyou understand this much better. Okay, so I will see you at the exercise\nso I will see you at the exercise\nso I will see you at the exercise then. Awesome. So, let's actually find\nthen. Awesome. So, let's actually find\nthen. Awesome. So, let's actually find out what the exercise is for this graph.\nout what the exercise is for this graph.\nout what the exercise is for this graph. So, you need to make this monstrosity.\nSo, you need to make this monstrosity.\nSo, you need to make this monstrosity. Now at first glance it looks terrifying\nNow at first glance it looks terrifying\nNow at first glance it looks terrifying but if you analyze it a little bit\nbut if you analyze it a little bit\nbut if you analyze it a little bit closer all it is is what we just coded\ncloser all it is is what we just coded\ncloser all it is is what we just coded twice. So we coded this and we need to\ntwice. So we coded this and we need to\ntwice. So we coded this and we need to replicate it once more. So in essence\nreplicate it once more. So in essence\nreplicate it once more. So in essence you need to actually input four numbers\nyou need to actually input four numbers\nyou need to actually input four numbers and two operations and you need to\nand two operations and you need to\nand two operations and you need to output their final results. For example\noutput their final results. For example\noutput their final results. For example number one, number two, number three,\nnumber one, number two, number three,\nnumber one, number two, number three, number four and the respective operation\nnumber four and the respective operation\nnumber four and the respective operation and the respective results. Right? So in\nand the respective results. Right? So in\nand the respective results. Right? So in this case we would have to do 10 - 5\nthis case we would have to do 10 - 5\nthis case we would have to do 10 - 5 which is 5 and 7 + 7 + 2 aka 9 and those\nwhich is 5 and 7 + 7 + 2 aka 9 and those\nwhich is 5 and 7 + 7 + 2 aka 9 and those two numbers should be outputed. Now the\ntwo numbers should be outputed. Now the\ntwo numbers should be outputed. Now the reason I gave you this exercise to do is\nreason I gave you this exercise to do is\nreason I gave you this exercise to do is because this will really solidify your\nbecause this will really solidify your\nbecause this will really solidify your understanding about conditional edges\nunderstanding about conditional edges\nunderstanding about conditional edges which will really be important for the\nwhich will really be important for the\nwhich will really be important for the next few next graph and the next AI\nnext few next graph and the next AI\nnext few next graph and the next AI agents we make. Okay. So once you have\nagents we make. Okay. So once you have\nagents we make. Okay. So once you have uh completed it by looking and cross\nuh completed it by looking and cross\nuh completed it by looking and cross referencing the answer on GitHub, I will\nreferencing the answer on GitHub, I will\nreferencing the answer on GitHub, I will see you in the next graph.\nsee you in the next graph.\nsee you in the next graph. Okay. All right. Well done. We're almost\nOkay. All right. Well done. We're almost\nOkay. All right. Well done. We're almost at the end of this section and we're\nat the end of this section and we're\nat the end of this section and we're about to build our final graph aka graph\nabout to build our final graph aka graph\nabout to build our final graph aka graph 5. Now we've learned quite a lot about\n5. Now we've learned quite a lot about\n5. Now we've learned quite a lot about Langraph and its internal mechanisms.\nLangraph and its internal mechanisms.\nLangraph and its internal mechanisms. And this will really help us in the next\nAnd this will really help us in the next\nAnd this will really help us in the next section where we finally build the AI\nsection where we finally build the AI\nsection where we finally build the AI agents you were looking for. Now in this\nagents you were looking for. Now in this\nagents you were looking for. Now in this section in this subsection sorry we're\nsection in this subsection sorry we're\nsection in this subsection sorry we're going to be learning an important\ngoing to be learning an important\ngoing to be learning an important concept.

There's still one more concept we haven't learned and that's about\nwe haven't learned and that's about\nwe haven't learned and that's about looping. So we're going to be creating\nlooping. So we're going to be creating\nlooping. So we're going to be creating well a simple looping graph. Now I kept\nwell a simple looping graph. Now I kept\nwell a simple looping graph. Now I kept the objectives to be quite small here.\nthe objectives to be quite small here.\nthe objectives to be quite small here. There aren't that many objectives.

It's essentially implementing logic uh which\nessentially implementing logic uh which\nessentially implementing logic uh which involves looping uh to route the flow of\ninvolves looping uh to route the flow of\ninvolves looping uh to route the flow of data back to the nodes. And we're going\ndata back to the nodes. And we're going\ndata back to the nodes. And we're going to be creating a single conditional edge\nto be creating a single conditional edge\nto be creating a single conditional edge which you know how to do in the previous\nwhich you know how to do in the previous\nwhich you know how to do in the previous section.

The main goal really\ngraph, I promise. The main goal really\ngraph, I promise. The main goal really is to code up the looping logic. So,\nis to code up the looping logic. So,\nis to code up the looping logic. So, with that out of the way, let's build a\nwith that out of the way, let's build a\nwith that out of the way, let's build a final code for this section. See you\nfinal code for this section. See you\nfinal code for this section. See you there. Awesome. So, final code we have\nthere. Awesome. So, final code we have\nthere. Awesome. So, final code we have to build for this section. And here we\nto build for this section. And here we\nto build for this section. And here we go. So, graph 5 squ. Now, I'm going to\ngo. So, graph 5 squ. Now, I'm going to\ngo. So, graph 5 squ. Now, I'm going to take a slightly different approach this\ntake a slightly different approach this\ntake a slightly different approach this time. And I'm actually going to show you\ntime. And I'm actually going to show you\ntime. And I'm actually going to show you the graph we want to end up building\nthe graph we want to end up building\nthe graph we want to end up building from the get- go. And there's a reason\nfrom the get- go. And there's a reason\nfrom the get- go. And there's a reason I'm going to start that from now so we\nI'm going to start that from now so we\nI'm going to start that from now so we get in good practice. The reason is once\nget in good practice. The reason is once\nget in good practice. The reason is once you finish this course and actually\nyou finish this course and actually\nyou finish this course and actually start either making your own AI agentic\nstart either making your own AI agentic\nstart either making your own AI agentic systems for someone else, for your\nsystems for someone else, for your\nsystems for someone else, for your clients or for yourself like make your\nclients or for yourself like make your\nclients or for yourself like make your own JavaS system or whatever. You\nown JavaS system or whatever. You\nown JavaS system or whatever. You obviously need to plan how it works,\nobviously need to plan how it works,\nobviously need to plan how it works, right? You need to see okay, what nodes\nright? You need to see okay, what nodes\nright? You need to see okay, what nodes do I need? What edges do I need? Does is\ndo I need? What edges do I need? Does is\ndo I need? What edges do I need? Does is this does this need to be a conditional\nthis does this need to be a conditional\nthis does this need to be a conditional edge? where's the start point going to\nedge? where's the start point going to\nedge? where's the start point going to go, end point going to go etc etc and\ngo, end point going to go etc etc and\ngo, end point going to go etc etc and you can either do that via pen and paper\nyou can either do that via pen and paper\nyou can either do that via pen and paper or software like I've used but point is\nor software like I've used but point is\nor software like I've used but point is you need some sort of blueprint and\nyou need some sort of blueprint and\nyou need some sort of blueprint and that's how really it works in the\nthat's how really it works in the\nthat's how really it works in the industry as well um you can you will\nindustry as well um you can you will\nindustry as well um you can you will obviously have a blueprint and then from\nobviously have a blueprint and then from\nobviously have a blueprint and then from there you will code up the graph similar\nthere you will code up the graph similar\nthere you will code up the graph similar to how a UI designer for example uh\nto how a UI designer for example uh\nto how a UI designer for example uh renders um their UI designs and then\nrenders um their UI designs and then\nrenders um their UI designs and then sends that off to a software developer\nsends that off to a software developer\nsends that off to a software developer who uh well develops the application\nwho uh well develops the application\nwho uh well develops the application forwards. Right? So that's the habit I\nforwards. Right? So that's the habit I\nforwards. Right? So that's the habit I want to start uh creating with you. All\nwant to start uh creating with you. All\nwant to start uh creating with you. All right. So this is the graph I want to\nright. So this is the graph I want to\nright. So this is the graph I want to build in this section. So there's\nbuild in this section. So there's\nbuild in this section. So there's obviously going to be a start and end\nobviously going to be a start and end\nobviously going to be a start and end point. And this really should be mostly\npoint. And this really should be mostly\npoint. And this really should be mostly familiar except for this loop. So there\nfamiliar except for this loop. So there\nfamiliar except for this loop. So there we're going to create a simple greeting\nwe're going to create a simple greeting\nwe're going to create a simple greeting node and another node which is called\nnode and another node which is called\nnode and another node which is called the random node. So in the greeting note\nthe random node. So in the greeting note\nthe random node. So in the greeting note I essentially want the user to have uh\nI essentially want the user to have uh\nI essentially want the user to have uh stated their name and it should output a\nstated their name and it should output a\nstated their name and it should output a simple hi there your name and then the\nsimple hi there your name and then the\nsimple hi there your name and then the graph progresses to the random node and\ngraph progresses to the random node and\ngraph progresses to the random node and in the random node I essentially want to\nin the random node I essentially want to\nin the random node I essentially want to generate five random numbers. Okay, now\ngenerate five random numbers. Okay, now\ngenerate five random numbers. Okay, now just as a heads up, yes, this graph in\njust as a heads up, yes, this graph in\njust as a heads up, yes, this graph in industry would be completely useless. I\nindustry would be completely useless. I\nindustry would be completely useless. I know, but I've deliberately kept it\nknow, but I've deliberately kept it\nknow, but I've deliberately kept it simple again so you know the\nsimple again so you know the\nsimple again so you know the fundamentals. Like this loop is could\nfundamentals. Like this loop is could\nfundamentals. Like this loop is could have easily been avoided and transferred\nhave easily been avoided and transferred\nhave easily been avoided and transferred into a for loop for example, right? Like\ninto a for loop for example, right? Like\ninto a for loop for example, right? Like I could have had a for loop within this\nI could have had a for loop within this\nI could have had a for loop within this node and ran it five times to generate\nnode and ran it five times to generate\nnode and ran it five times to generate the numbers. I get it. But this is again\nthe numbers. I get it. But this is again\nthe numbers. I get it. But this is again kept deliberately simple so you actually\nkept deliberately simple so you actually\nkept deliberately simple so you actually understand the concept. Okay, cool. So\nunderstand the concept. Okay, cool. So\nunderstand the concept. Okay, cool. So let's the usual inputs and the only\nlet's the usual inputs and the only\nlet's the usual inputs and the only difference is this time I've also\ndifference is this time I've also\ndifference is this time I've also imported random but if you have used\nimported random but if you have used\nimported random but if you have used Python before quite a lot you would have\nPython before quite a lot you would have\nPython before quite a lot you would have come across this library right okay so\ncome across this library right okay so\ncome across this library right okay so let's start with our agent state so\nlet's start with our agent state so\nlet's start with our agent state so class agent state type\nclass agent state type\nclass agent state type dictionary and what's the first thing\ndictionary and what's the first thing\ndictionary and what's the first thing we're going to need well let's see we\nwe're going to need well let's see we\nwe're going to need well let's see we have the start point do we need anything\nhave the start point do we need anything\nhave the start point do we need anything any keys that no for greeting note what\nany keys that no for greeting note what\nany keys that no for greeting note what did I say I want uh I wanted the user to\ndid I say I want uh I wanted the user to\ndid I say I want uh I wanted the user to be able to input their name. So, we need\nbe able to input their name. So, we need\nbe able to input their name. So, we need a name attribute or a key. And then for\na name attribute or a key. And then for\na name attribute or a key. And then for the random number, a random node, we\nthe random number, a random node, we\nthe random number, a random node, we need some form of um a list to like\nneed some form of um a list to like\nneed some form of um a list to like actually store the numbers. So, we have\nactually store the numbers. So, we have\nactually store the numbers. So, we have number and list\nnumber and list\nnumber and list int. Okay, cool. And one more thing,\nint. Okay, cool. And one more thing,\nint. Okay, cool. And one more thing, look at this loop. How will we actually\nlook at this loop. How will we actually\nlook at this loop. How will we actually know when to stop? We need some form of\nknow when to stop? We need some form of\nknow when to stop? We need some form of counter, right? So, counter int.\ncounter, right? So, counter int.\ncounter, right? So, counter int. Perfect. Now, obviously, just as a heads\nPerfect. Now, obviously, just as a heads\nPerfect. Now, obviously, just as a heads up, when you do go on to make your AI\nup, when you do go on to make your AI\nup, when you do go on to make your AI agents and everything, you're not going\nagents and everything, you're not going\nagents and everything, you're not going to know what attributes you need right\nto know what attributes you need right\nto know what attributes you need right from the get- go, unless if you planned\nfrom the get- go, unless if you planned\nfrom the get- go, unless if you planned it like extremely extremely well. But\nit like extremely extremely well. But\nit like extremely extremely well. But chances are you won't get it. But don't\nchances are you won't get it. But don't\nchances are you won't get it. But don't worry, iteratively well, you'll\nworry, iteratively well, you'll\nworry, iteratively well, you'll obviously be better at speculating what\nobviously be better at speculating what\nobviously be better at speculating what attributes you need through practice.\nattributes you need through practice.\nattributes you need through practice. But you can obviously do iterative\nBut you can obviously do iterative\nBut you can obviously do iterative development as well, right? Okay, cool.\ndevelopment as well, right? Okay, cool.\ndevelopment as well, right? Okay, cool. So now let's actually build these\nSo now let's actually build these\nSo now let's actually build these nodes. Okay. So let's start off with the\nnodes. Okay. So let's start off with the\nnodes. Okay. So let's start off with the uh greeting node. So how we normally\nuh greeting node. So how we normally\nuh greeting node. So how we normally define uh a function. So def greeting\ndefine uh a function. So def greeting\ndefine uh a function. So def greeting node, we obviously need the agent\nnode, we obviously need the agent\nnode, we obviously need the agent states like such. Perfect. And the dock\nstates like such. Perfect. And the dock\nstates like such. Perfect. And the dock string. But uh luckily for me, I've\nstring. But uh luckily for me, I've\nstring. But uh luckily for me, I've already got that here. So I don't need\nalready got that here. So I don't need\nalready got that here. So I don't need to do it again. I know it's boring, but\nto do it again. I know it's boring, but\nto do it again. I know it's boring, but habits. Now let's update update the uh\nhabits. Now let's update update the uh\nhabits. Now let's update update the uh name uh key. So how do we do that? Well,\nname uh key. So how do we do that? Well,\nname uh key. So how do we do that? Well, you should know by now state name is\nyou should know by now state name is\nyou should know by now state name is equal\nequal\nequal to let's say something like hi\nto let's say something like hi\nto let's say something like hi there. State name.\nthere. State name.\nthere. State name. Perfect. So what will this do? I input a\nPerfect. So what will this do? I input a\nPerfect. So what will this do? I input a name and it'll replace that name with a\nname and it'll replace that name with a\nname and it'll replace that name with a string of hi there this person. Now\nstring of hi there this person. Now\nstring of hi there this person. Now let's also initialize the counter\nlet's also initialize the counter\nlet's also initialize the counter variable here. Now why am I doing that?\nvariable here. Now why am I doing that?\nvariable here. Now why am I doing that? Let me just first write it and think\nLet me just first write it and think\nLet me just first write it and think about this.\nabout this.\nabout this. Okay. Now, obviously I'm changing I'm\nOkay. Now, obviously I'm changing I'm\nOkay. Now, obviously I'm changing I'm setting like the value. So, I will need\nsetting like the value. So, I will need\nsetting like the value. So, I will need to have passed in like an valid integer\nto have passed in like an valid integer\nto have passed in like an valid integer when I am passing the uh value when I'm\nwhen I am passing the uh value when I'm\nwhen I am passing the uh value when I'm invoking the graph, right? But here's\ninvoking the graph, right? But here's\ninvoking the graph, right? But here's the thing. What if I pass in minus2 for\nthe thing. What if I pass in minus2 for\nthe thing. What if I pass in minus2 for example?\nexample?\nexample? Well, as the counter value, as the\nWell, as the counter value, as the\nWell, as the counter value, as the initial counter value, if this line\ninitial counter value, if this line\ninitial counter value, if this line wasn't there, well, it would have just\nwasn't there, well, it would have just\nwasn't there, well, it would have just kept on incrementing until it got got to\nkept on incrementing until it got got to\nkept on incrementing until it got got to five cuz I want to have five numbers.\nfive cuz I want to have five numbers.\nfive cuz I want to have five numbers. But if it starts at minus2, well, it\nBut if it starts at minus2, well, it\nBut if it starts at minus2, well, it would end up giving me seven numbers.\nwould end up giving me seven numbers.\nwould end up giving me seven numbers. Now, that's not robust, right? So, this\nNow, that's not robust, right? So, this\nNow, that's not robust, right? So, this basically wipes out whatever rubbish\nbasically wipes out whatever rubbish\nbasically wipes out whatever rubbish integer the user even inputs. If they\ninteger the user even inputs. If they\ninteger the user even inputs. If they had put zero, well, okay, we replaced it\nhad put zero, well, okay, we replaced it\nhad put zero, well, okay, we replaced it to zero. If they put like minus 20\nto zero. If they put like minus 20\nto zero. If they put like minus 20 because they're greedy or something,\nbecause they're greedy or something,\nbecause they're greedy or something, then we have made sure to like set that\nthen we have made sure to like set that\nthen we have made sure to like set that back to zero. So, so just a way to make\nback to zero. So, so just a way to make\nback to zero. So, so just a way to make it robust. That's all. Uh, return state.\nit robust. That's all. Uh, return state.\nit robust. That's all. Uh, return state. Okay, cool. So, now let's create our\nOkay, cool. So, now let's create our\nOkay, cool. So, now let's create our second node which is a random node. So,\nsecond node which is a random node. So,\nsecond node which is a random node. So, we can say random node state agent state\nwe can say random node state agent state\nwe can say random node state agent state agent state. Perfect. Dog string.\nagent state. Perfect. Dog string.\nagent state. Perfect. Dog string. Again the dog strings will be useful. I\nAgain the dog strings will be useful. I\nAgain the dog strings will be useful. I promise in the next section they will.\npromise in the next section they will.\npromise in the next section they will. So this generates a number random number\nSo this generates a number random number\nSo this generates a number random number from 0 to 10. Now this piece of code\nfrom 0 to 10. Now this piece of code\nfrom 0 to 10. Now this piece of code here\nhere\nhere essentially appends the appends the\nessentially appends the appends the\nessentially appends the appends the randomly generated number to the number\nrandomly generated number to the number\nrandomly generated number to the number list. Okay, that's all it does. And what\nlist. Okay, that's all it does. And what\nlist. Okay, that's all it does. And what else do we need to do in this node?\nelse do we need to do in this node?\nelse do we need to do in this node? Well, we need to increment the counter\nWell, we need to increment the counter\nWell, we need to increment the counter value, right?\nvalue, right?\nvalue, right? So C uh plus equals to one. So this will\nSo C uh plus equals to one. So this will\nSo C uh plus equals to one. So this will increment uh the value by one and then\nincrement uh the value by one and then\nincrement uh the value by one and then we just return the\nwe just return the\nwe just return the state. Okay, cool. Now here's where\nstate. Okay, cool. Now here's where\nstate. Okay, cool. Now here's where we're how we're going to implement the\nwe're how we're going to implement the\nwe're how we're going to implement the looping logic. Now just a warning here\nlooping logic.

So how do we go about that?\nnode here. So how do we go about that? Well, we could create a conditional\nWell, we could create a conditional\nWell, we could create a conditional edge. How do we do that? Okay, let's\nedge. How do we do that? Okay, let's\nedge. How do we do that? Okay, let's begin that. So let's write a new\nbegin that. So let's write a new\nbegin that. So let's write a new function say defaf should continue\nfunction say defaf should continue\nfunction say defaf should continue uh state agent\nuh state agent\nuh state agent state agent\nstate agent\nstate agent state and um let's create this block\nstate and um let's create this block\nstate and um let's create this block string um function to decide what to do\nstring um function to decide what to do\nstring um function to decide what to do next something like that. Okay cool now\nnext something like that. Okay cool now\nnext something like that.

Perfect. So let's run that. Okay.\nnow. Perfect. So let's run that. Okay. So what have I written here? Well, if\nSo what have I written here? Well, if\nSo what have I written here? Well, if the counter value is less than five\nthe counter value is less than five\nthe counter value is less than five because we're starting with zero, right?\nbecause we're starting with zero, right?\nbecause we're starting with zero, right? So 0 1 2 3 4. That'll be five values. Um\nSo 0 1 2 3 4. That'll be five values. Um\nSo 0 1 2 3 4. That'll be five values. Um I've also written a print statement so\nI've also written a print statement so\nI've also written a print statement so like we can keep track of um um the\nlike we can keep track of um um the\nlike we can keep track of um um the progress.

Also whenever I'm writing the code as well when you're uh coding with\ncode as well when you're uh coding with\ncode as well when you're uh coding with me or doing the exercise, it's really\nme or doing the exercise, it's really\nme or doing the exercise, it's really helpful to print uh statements uh like\nhelpful to print uh statements uh like\nhelpful to print uh statements uh like put in print statements everywhere. Or\nput in print statements everywhere. Or\nput in print statements everywhere. Or you could also use break points as well.\nyou could also use break points as well.\nyou could also use break points as well. So you know uh where to where the code\nSo you know uh where to where the code\nSo you know uh where to where the code failed if it\nfailed if it\nfailed if it fails. Okay. So here we return the loop\nfails. Okay. So here we return the loop\nfails. Okay. So here we return the loop a loop edge and the exit edge. So\na loop edge and the exit edge. So\na loop edge and the exit edge. So obviously we have the loop edge and this\nobviously we have the loop edge and this\nobviously we have the loop edge and this will be the exit edge. So everything is\nwill be the exit edge. So everything is\nwill be the exit edge. So everything is going to plan so far but um so far is\ngoing to plan so far but um so far is\ngoing to plan so far but um so far is the key. You never know, right? Okay. Uh\nthe key. You never know, right? Okay. Uh\nthe key. You never know, right? Okay. Uh just as a heads up though, I want to\njust as a heads up though, I want to\njust as a heads up though, I want to show you this. So this is how the\nshow you this. So this is how the\nshow you this. So this is how the trajectory should follow. We start at\ntrajectory should follow. We start at\ntrajectory should follow. We start at the greeting node. Why? Cuz we obviously\nthe greeting node. Why? Cuz we obviously\nthe greeting node. Why? Cuz we obviously go from the start to the greeting node.\ngo from the start to the greeting node.\ngo from the start to the greeting node. And then we enter the random node. And\nAnd then we enter the random node. And\nAnd then we enter the random node. And we enter the random node and exit it\nwe enter the random node and exit it\nwe enter the random node and exit it five times. So 1 2 3 4 5. Why five\nfive times. So 1 2 3 4 5. Why five\nfive times. So 1 2 3 4 5. Why five times? Because we want five random\ntimes? Because we want five random\ntimes? Because we want five random numbers, right? By then this if\nnumbers, right? By then this if\nnumbers, right? By then this if statement will uh well it won't work. It\nstatement will uh well it won't work. It\nstatement will uh well it won't work. It will fail. So we will go to the else\nwill fail. So we will go to the else\nwill fail. So we will go to the else statement and return exit. And if we\nstatement and return exit. And if we\nstatement and return exit. And if we return to exit, we'll go to the end\nreturn to exit, we'll go to the end\nreturn to exit, we'll go to the end node. Uh okay. endpoint. Okay, so that's\nnode. Uh okay. endpoint. Okay, so that's\nnode. Uh okay. endpoint. Okay, so that's how the general gist is. Okay, let's\nhow the general gist is. Okay, let's\nhow the general gist is. Okay, let's quickly make this graph. So you should\nquickly make this graph. So you should\nquickly make this graph. So you should know how to initialize a graph agent\nknow how to initialize a graph agent\nknow how to initialize a graph agent graph and let's just add these nodes. So\ngraph and let's just add these nodes. So\ngraph and let's just add these nodes. So we have our two nodes which are\nwe have our two nodes which are\nwe have our two nodes which are here greeting and random which is\nhere greeting and random which is\nhere greeting and random which is exactly what we wanted, right? Greeting\nexactly what we wanted, right? Greeting\nexactly what we wanted, right? Greeting node and random node. Perfect. Okay. And\nnode and random node. Perfect. Okay. And\nnode and random node. Perfect. Okay. And now we're going to add an edge between\nnow we're going to add an edge between\nnow we're going to add an edge between greeting and random. Uh why? Because\ngreeting and random. Uh why? Because\ngreeting and random. Uh why? Because well I've created this edge. You see\nwell I've created this edge. You see\nwell I've created this edge.

So uh there will be the source\nwell. So uh there will be the source\nwell. So uh there will be the source node which is the random. So where I\nnode which is the random. So where I\nnode which is the random. So where I want the conditional edge to start from\nwant the conditional edge to start from\nwant the conditional edge to start from and then the routing function or this\nand then the routing function or this\nand then the routing function or this tree I should have really written action\ntree I should have really written action\ntree I should have really written action here because is the action I want to\nhere because is the action I want to\nhere because is the action I want to perform the underlying mechanism or\nperform the underlying mechanism or\nperform the underlying mechanism or function which is going to which we're\nfunction which is going to which we're\nfunction which is going to which we're going to um determine which edge to use\ngoing to um determine which edge to use\ngoing to um determine which edge to use and that's uh implemented by the should\nand that's uh implemented by the should\nand that's uh implemented by the should continue function right and notice how\ncontinue function right and notice how\ncontinue function right and notice how again these two edges are the same edges\nagain these two edges are the same edges\nagain these two edges are the same edges here. So if the loop is uh the one which\nhere. So if the loop is uh the one which\nhere. So if the loop is uh the one which um uh is outputed then we need to go\num uh is outputed then we need to go\num uh is outputed then we need to go back into its random the random node\nback into its random the random node\nback into its random the random node which we've generate uh which we put\nwhich we've generate uh which we put\nwhich we've generate uh which we put there and if it doesn't we go to the end\nthere and if it doesn't we go to the end\nthere and if it doesn't we go to the end part. Okay and then obviously we set the\npart. Okay and then obviously we set the\npart. Okay and then obviously we set the entry\nentry\nentry point. Okay. So again you don't have to\npoint. Okay. So again you don't have to\npoint. Okay. So again you don't have to set the exit point here uh or the finish\nset the exit point here uh or the finish\nset the exit point here uh or the finish point because we've already done it\npoint because we've already done it\npoint because we've already done it using end here. Okay, perfect. And then\nusing end here. Okay, perfect. And then\nusing end here. Okay, perfect. And then we just compile the graph app is equal\nwe just compile the graph app is equal\nwe just compile the graph app is equal to\ngraph.compile and okay, it compiled.\ngraph.compile and okay, it compiled. That's a good sign. But let's see if we\nThat's a good sign. But let's see if we\nThat's a good sign. But let's see if we have got our graph to be the exact\nhave got our graph to be the exact\nhave got our graph to be the exact same. Now I'll put the graph image here\nsame. Now I'll put the graph image here\nsame. Now I'll put the graph image here so I don't keep scrolling back and\nso I don't keep scrolling back and\nso I don't keep scrolling back and forth. But you can see we have the start\nforth. But you can see we have the start\nforth. But you can see we have the start point and the end point. We have the\npoint and the end point. We have the\npoint and the end point. We have the greeting and the random. And then we\ngreeting and the random. And then we\ngreeting and the random. And then we have our two condition edges. So we have\nhave our two condition edges. So we have\nhave our two condition edges. So we have the loop going back into the random node\nthe loop going back into the random node\nthe loop going back into the random node as we wanted and the exit which you can\nas we wanted and the exit which you can\nas we wanted and the exit which you can see. So take a moment and you can see\nsee. So take a moment and you can see\nsee. So take a moment and you can see compare and contrast. Okay, let's\ncontinue. Okay, now I have this\ncontinue. Okay, now I have this code. So I've given a name my name uh a\ncode. So I've given a name my name uh a\ncode. So I've given a name my name uh a r um a completely brand new list and\nr um a completely brand new list and\nr um a completely brand new list and I've set counter to minus\nI've set counter to minus\nI've set counter to minus one. And as you can see it enters loop\none. And as you can see it enters loop\none. And as you can see it enters loop one, loop two, loop three, loop four\none, loop two, loop three, loop four\none, loop two, loop three, loop four because these are print statements we\nbecause these are print statements we\nbecause these are print statements we printed. Uh it says hi there v which is\nprinted. Uh it says hi there v which is\nprinted. Uh it says hi there v which is my name. Uh number 10 21026 just\nmy name. Uh number 10 21026 just\nmy name. Uh number 10 21026 just randomly generated and you can see the\nrandomly generated and you can see the\nrandomly generated and you can see the counter value is five. Now remember what\ncounter value is five. Now remember what\ncounter value is five. Now remember what I was saying over the counter. We set\nI was saying over the counter. We set\nI was saying over the counter. We set the counter value to zero here to make\nthe counter value to zero here to make\nthe counter value to zero here to make it more robust. If we had not done that\nit more robust. If we had not done that\nit more robust. If we had not done that well it would have generated six times.\nwell it would have generated six times.\nwell it would have generated six times. And now I can set this to minus 100. it\nAnd now I can set this to minus 100. it\nAnd now I can set this to minus 100. it will still obviously give me different\nwill still obviously give me different\nwill still obviously give me different random values but um the code is largely\nrandom values but um the code is largely\nrandom values but um the code is largely the same. So that's really the way which\nthe same. So that's really the way which\nthe same. So that's really the way which I personally use to create loops in\nI personally use to create loops in\nI personally use to create loops in langraph it's pretty easy right but um\nlangraph it's pretty easy right but um\nlangraph it's pretty easy right but um obviously with practice you might even\nobviously with practice you might even\nobviously with practice you might even find some other ways if you do find\nfind some other ways if you do find\nfind some other ways if you do find other ways like obviously uh do let me\nother ways like obviously uh do let me\nother ways like obviously uh do let me know uh there's more than one way again\nknow uh there's more than one way again\nknow uh there's more than one way again you can send me a message on LinkedIn or\nyou can send me a message on LinkedIn or\nyou can send me a message on LinkedIn or Instagram or whatever but um yeah so\nInstagram or whatever but um yeah so\nInstagram or whatever but um yeah so this is finally finally uh we have\nthis is finally finally uh we have\nthis is finally finally uh we have implemented the code for our final graph\nimplemented the code for our final graph\nimplemented the code for our final graph of the section\nof the section\nof the section So just complete the graph 5 exercise\nSo just complete the graph 5 exercise\nSo just complete the graph 5 exercise please and yeah we should be good to go\nplease and yeah we should be good to go\nplease and yeah we should be good to go to make AI agents. So I'll see you at\nto make AI agents. So I'll see you at\nto make AI agents. So I'll see you at this codes exercise. Okay\nthis codes exercise. Okay\nthis codes exercise. Okay cool. Okay good job on that. Now for the\ncool. Okay good job on that. Now for the\ncool. Okay good job on that. Now for the exercise for this last graph uh you need\nexercise for this last graph uh you need\nexercise for this last graph uh you need to implement this graph on the right. So\nto implement this graph on the right. So\nto implement this graph on the right. So you need to implement an automatic\nyou need to implement an automatic\nyou need to implement an automatic higher or lower gain. So for context,\nhigher or lower gain. So for context,\nhigher or lower gain. So for context, you need to set the bounce which we can\nyou need to set the bounce which we can\nyou need to set the bounce which we can guess between 1 to 20 integers of course\nguess between 1 to 20 integers of course\nguess between 1 to 20 integers of course and the graph has to keep guessing where\nand the graph has to keep guessing where\nand the graph has to keep guessing where the max number of guesses is 7 where if\nthe max number of guesses is 7 where if\nthe max number of guesses is 7 where if the guess is correct it stops but if not\nthe guess is correct it stops but if not\nthe guess is correct it stops but if not we keep looping until we hit the max\nwe keep looping until we hit the max\nwe keep looping until we hit the max limit of seven. Now please note we don't\nlimit of seven. Now please note we don't\nlimit of seven. Now please note we don't have to pass any inputs the actual graph\nhave to pass any inputs the actual graph\nhave to pass any inputs the actual graph should automatically guess by itself. So\nshould automatically guess by itself. So\nshould automatically guess by itself. So there should be no human in the loop\nthere should be no human in the loop\nthere should be no human in the loop human intervention at all. So each time\nhuman intervention at all. So each time\nhuman intervention at all. So each time a number is guessed the hint node aka\na number is guessed the hint node aka\na number is guessed the hint node aka this node should say either higher or\nthis node should say either higher or\nthis node should say either higher or lower and the graph should account for\nlower and the graph should account for\nlower and the graph should account for this information and guess the next\nthis information and guess the next\nthis information and guess the next guess according accordingly. So for\nguess according accordingly. So for\nguess according accordingly. So for example the input should be something\nexample the input should be something\nexample the input should be something like the player name student. The guess\nlike the player name student. The guess\nlike the player name student. The guess should just be an empty list cuz we're\nshould just be an empty list cuz we're\nshould just be an empty list cuz we're initializing the list. Attempts should\ninitializing the list. Attempts should\ninitializing the list. Attempts should be set to zero and the lower bound and\nbe set to zero and the lower bound and\nbe set to zero and the lower bound and upper bound should be 1 to 20. Now the\nupper bound should be 1 to 20. Now the\nupper bound should be 1 to 20. Now the reason I've also passed these as inputs\nreason I've also passed these as inputs\nreason I've also passed these as inputs is because uh if you wanted to expand\nis because uh if you wanted to expand\nis because uh if you wanted to expand this to maybe 1 to 50 numbers or\nthis to maybe 1 to 50 numbers or\nthis to maybe 1 to 50 numbers or whatever you can. It's quite easy to do\nwhatever you can. It's quite easy to do\nwhatever you can. It's quite easy to do that. So just as a hint uh it will need\nthat. So just as a hint uh it will need\nthat. So just as a hint uh it will need to adjust it its bounds after every\nto adjust it its bounds after every\nto adjust it its bounds after every guess based on the hint provided by the\nguess based on the hint provided by the\nguess based on the hint provided by the hint though. So once you've completed\nhint though. So once you've completed\nhint though. So once you've completed this exercise you would have fully\nthis exercise you would have fully\nthis exercise you would have fully reinforced uh your understanding about\nreinforced uh your understanding about\nreinforced uh your understanding about loops in langraph. So once you've\nloops in langraph. So once you've\nloops in langraph. So once you've completed this, cross reference it.\ncompleted this, cross reference it.\ncompleted this, cross reference it. Cross reference the answers on GitHub. I\nCross reference the answers on GitHub. I\nCross reference the answers on GitHub. I will see you in the next section where\nwill see you in the next section where\nwill see you in the next section where we finally begin AI agents. See you\nwe finally begin AI agents. See you\nwe finally begin AI agents. See you there. Okay people. So welcome back to\nthere. Okay people. So welcome back to\nthere. Okay people. So welcome back to this brand new section where we actually\nthis brand new section where we actually\nthis brand new section where we actually start learning about AI agents. Now we\nstart learning about AI agents. Now we\nstart learning about AI agents. Now we finally are upgrading our ability in\nfinally are upgrading our ability in\nfinally are upgrading our ability in Langro. I even upgraded my clothing\nLangro. I even upgraded my clothing\nLangro. I even upgraded my clothing sense. Not really. But this is exciting\nsense. Not really. But this is exciting\nsense. Not really. But this is exciting times cuz we actually finally build AI\ntimes cuz we actually finally build AI\ntimes cuz we actually finally build AI agents. So, we're going to build a lot\nagents. So, we're going to build a lot\nagents. So, we're going to build a lot of AI agents in this section. And\nof AI agents in this section. And\nof AI agents in this section. And starting off with the first agent. Well,\nstarting off with the first agent. Well,\nstarting off with the first agent. Well, technically it's not really an agent,\ntechnically it's not really an agent,\ntechnically it's not really an agent, but I just named it that because it\nbut I just named it that because it\nbut I just named it that because it sounds cool. But um technically it's not\nsounds cool. But um technically it's not\nsounds cool. But um technically it's not though. But let's see what we're going\nthough. But let's see what we're going\nthough. But let's see what we're going to actually learn in this section in\nto actually learn in this section in\nto actually learn in this section in this subsection. So, we're going to\nthis subsection. So, we're going to\nthis subsection. So, we're going to build a simple bot. That's it. And these\nbuild a simple bot. That's it. And these\nbuild a simple bot. That's it. And these are the objectives. So we're going to\nare the objectives. So we're going to\nare the objectives. So we're going to define a state variable uh state\ndefine a state variable uh state\ndefine a state variable uh state structure which we're going to have a\nstructure which we're going to have a\nstructure which we're going to have a list of human message objects and I\nlist of human message objects and I\nlist of human message objects and I briefly uh me uh mentioned what a human\nbriefly uh me uh mentioned what a human\nbriefly uh me uh mentioned what a human message was uh a long time ago in the\nmessage was uh a long time ago in the\nmessage was uh a long time ago in the course. Uh what it is it's well it's in\ncourse. Uh what it is it's well it's in\ncourse. Uh what it is it's well it's in the name it's a message prompt which is\nthe name it's a message prompt which is\nthe name it's a message prompt which is given by the human aka us to the AI. Uh\ngiven by the human aka us to the AI. Uh\ngiven by the human aka us to the AI. Uh we're going to initialize the GPD40\nwe're going to initialize the GPD40\nwe're going to initialize the GPD40 model for this uh using lang chain's\nmodel for this uh using lang chain's\nmodel for this uh using lang chain's chat open AAI uh uh library. Uh we're\nchat open AAI uh uh library. Uh we're\nchat open AAI uh uh library. Uh we're going to send and handle different types\ngoing to send and handle different types\ngoing to send and handle different types of messages. We're going to build and\nof messages. We're going to build and\nof messages. We're going to build and compile the graph of the agent. But the\ncompile the graph of the agent. But the\ncompile the graph of the agent. But the main goal really is how we can integrate\nmain goal really is how we can integrate\nmain goal really is how we can integrate LLMs into our graphs. So what is this\nLLMs into our graphs. So what is this\nLLMs into our graphs. So what is this sort of graph we actually going to end\nsort of graph we actually going to end\nsort of graph we actually going to end up building? Now it's very very simple.\nup building? Now it's very very simple.\nup building? Now it's very very simple. It's going to look like this. And yes,\nIt's going to look like this. And yes,\nIt's going to look like this. And yes, this looks exactly like the graph we\nthis looks exactly like the graph we\nthis looks exactly like the graph we made in the uh first ever graph we\nmade in the uh first ever graph we\nmade in the uh first ever graph we actually ever made. But um the\nactually ever made. But um the\nactually ever made. But um the functionality will obviously be\nfunctionality will obviously be\nfunctionality will obviously be different cuz now we're actually\ndifferent cuz now we're actually\ndifferent cuz now we're actually integrating LM. So exciting stuff\nintegrating LM. So exciting stuff\nintegrating LM. So exciting stuff people. Uh okay, I will see you at the\npeople. Uh okay, I will see you at the\npeople. Uh okay, I will see you at the code\ncode\ncode then. All right, coding time. So now we\nthen. All right, coding time. So now we\nthen. All right, coding time. So now we first code our well we code up our very\nfirst code our well we code up our very\nfirst code our well we code up our very first AI agent aka the simple what and\nfirst AI agent aka the simple what and\nfirst AI agent aka the simple what and um I've already imported all the\num I've already imported all the\num I've already imported all the necessary libraries we'll need uh to not\nnecessary libraries we'll need uh to not\nnecessary libraries we'll need uh to not waste time. So while you're uh coding\nwaste time. So while you're uh coding\nwaste time. So while you're uh coding these up as well and copying these I'll\nthese up as well and copying these I'll\nthese up as well and copying these I'll also briefly explain what these are so\nalso briefly explain what these are so\nalso briefly explain what these are so we're at the same level. Okay, so we've\nwe're at the same level. Okay, so we've\nwe're at the same level. Okay, so we've already imported type dictionary and\nalready imported type dictionary and\nalready imported type dictionary and list many times before but um these two\nlist many times before but um these two\nlist many times before but um these two we haven't sorry these two the lang\nwe haven't sorry these two the lang\nwe haven't sorry these two the lang chain codon messages import human\nchain codon messages import human\nchain codon messages import human message so I briefly mentioned this in\nmessage so I briefly mentioned this in\nmessage so I briefly mentioned this in the intro of this section of the\nthe intro of this section of the\nthe intro of this section of the subsection what a human message is right\nsubsection what a human message is right\nsubsection what a human message is right and this is the library we get it from\nand this is the library we get it from\nand this is the library we get it from and similarly we're going to be using\nand similarly we're going to be using\nand similarly we're going to be using openai's lms so that's why we're going\nopenai's lms so that's why we're going\nopenai's lms so that's why we're going to use chat openai from the lang chain\nto use chat openai from the lang chain\nto use chat openai from the lang chain open aai uh library uh the\nopen aai uh library uh the\nopen aai uh library uh the langraph.graph. Uh these we were\nlangraph.graph. Uh these we were\nlangraph.graph. Uh these we were familiar with and this is the env. Now\nfamiliar with and this is the env. Now\nfamiliar with and this is the env. Now just a few points. You could have been\njust a few points. You could have been\njust a few points. You could have been saying okay wait hold on I thought we\nsaying okay wait hold on I thought we\nsaying okay wait hold on I thought we were about to do a langraph stuff. Why\nwere about to do a langraph stuff. Why\nwere about to do a langraph stuff. Why is the lang chain stuff here? Now you\nis the lang chain stuff here? Now you\nis the lang chain stuff here? Now you must know that langraph is built on top\nmust know that langraph is built on top\nmust know that langraph is built on top of lang chain and lang chain already has\nof lang chain and lang chain already has\nof lang chain and lang chain already has the sophisticated libraries right so why\nthe sophisticated libraries right so why\nthe sophisticated libraries right so why not actually use them that's how\nnot actually use them that's how\nnot actually use them that's how langraph is designed it's designed to\nlangraph is designed it's designed to\nlangraph is designed it's designed to use the robust sophisticated libraries\nuse the robust sophisticated libraries\nuse the robust sophisticated libraries which lang chain offers right so no I'm\nwhich lang chain offers right so no I'm\nwhich lang chain offers right so no I'm not a trader we're still doing langraph\nnot a trader we're still doing langraph\nnot a trader we're still doing langraph stuff but we're also using leveraging\nstuff but we're also using leveraging\nstuff but we're also using leveraging lang chain strengths as well okay and um\nlang chain strengths as well okay and um\nlang chain strengths as well okay and um now this env file now it's okay if you\nnow this env file now it's okay if you\nnow this env file now it's okay if you haven't ever um encountered av file\nhaven't ever um encountered av file\nhaven't ever um encountered av file before. Essentially, it's just a file\nbefore. Essentially, it's just a file\nbefore. Essentially, it's just a file used to store secret stuff like API keys\nused to store secret stuff like API keys\nused to store secret stuff like API keys or configuration values. So, it's really\nor configuration values. So, it's really\nor configuration values. So, it's really there for security purposes. Now, I have\nthere for security purposes. Now, I have\nthere for security purposes. Now, I have my own\nmy own\nmy own um file stored in my folder structure uh\num file stored in my folder structure uh\num file stored in my folder structure uh so that you don't see my API key uh\nso that you don't see my API key uh\nso that you don't see my API key uh because if you do then I would go\nbecause if you do then I would go\nbecause if you do then I would go bankrupt. So, that's why. Now, you might\nbankrupt. So, that's why. Now, you might\nbankrupt. So, that's why. Now, you might also be wondering why do we need an API\nalso be wondering why do we need an API\nalso be wondering why do we need an API key here? We need the API key because\nkey here? We need the API key because\nkey here? We need the API key because we're doing calls to an external LLM. If\nwe're doing calls to an external LLM. If\nwe're doing calls to an external LLM. If we were using our own LLM like through\nwe were using our own LLM like through\nwe were using our own LLM like through OAMA, then we would um not have an API\nOAMA, then we would um not have an API\nOAMA, then we would um not have an API key, right? We would just use like the\nkey, right? We would just use like the\nkey, right? We would just use like the Olama library integration with lang\nOlama library integration with lang\nOlama library integration with lang chain. So because we're using charges,\nchain. So because we're using charges,\nchain. So because we're using charges, we need an API to communicate with the\nwe need an API to communicate with the\nwe need an API to communicate with the LLM in their cloud servers. Cool. So how\nLLM in their cloud servers. Cool. So how\nLLM in their cloud servers. Cool. So how do we actually load this? So to load our\ndo we actually load this? So to load our\ndo we actually load this? So to load our um API, we just use a simple Python uh\num API, we just use a simple Python uh\num API, we just use a simple Python uh code load. Env. All right. So now that\ncode load. Env. All right. So now that\ncode load. Env. All right. So now that we're at the same level, let's actually\nwe're at the same level, let's actually\nwe're at the same level, let's actually code up our AI agent. Cool. So let's\ncode up our AI agent. Cool. So let's\ncode up our AI agent. Cool. So let's define the state like we always do. So\ndefine the state like we always do. So\ndefine the state like we always do. So this time class agent\nthis time class agent\nthis time class agent state type\nstate type\nstate type dictionary. Perfect. Okay. Now what are\ndictionary. Perfect. Okay. Now what are\ndictionary. Perfect. Okay. Now what are the attributes we need in this section\nthe attributes we need in this section\nthe attributes we need in this section uh in this uh state? Well really just\nuh in this uh state? Well really just\nuh in this uh state? Well really just one the messages part right so messages\none the messages part right so messages\none the messages part right so messages but what form will it be well it will be\nbut what form will it be well it will be\nbut what form will it be well it will be in the form of a a list of human\nin the form of a a list of human\nin the form of a a list of human messages right so we'll have list human\nmessages right so we'll have list human\nmessages right so we'll have list human message why because we when we invoke\nmessage why because we when we invoke\nmessage why because we when we invoke the graph we're inputting human messages\nthe graph we're inputting human messages\nthe graph we're inputting human messages right so to tell the large language\nright so to tell the large language\nright so to tell the large language model that this is a human message I i.e\nmodel that this is a human message I i.e\nmodel that this is a human message I i.e Uh this is a message from me the user\nUh this is a message from me the user\nUh this is a message from me the user aka human right. Um we need to actually\naka human right. Um we need to actually\naka human right. Um we need to actually mention human message that it's a human\nmention human message that it's a human\nmention human message that it's a human message type. Cool. Okay. So now we\nmessage type. Cool. Okay. So now we\nmessage type. Cool. Okay. So now we actually initial initialize the large\nactually initial initialize the large\nactually initial initialize the large language model. So we just write lm is\nlanguage model. So we just write lm is\nlanguage model. So we just write lm is equal to chat openai. And now we specify\nequal to chat openai. And now we specify\nequal to chat openai. And now we specify what model we want. Now I'm going for\nwhat model we want. Now I'm going for\nwhat model we want. Now I'm going for GPD4er. Now yes there's also chat uh\nGPD4er. Now yes there's also chat uh\nGPD4er. Now yes there's also chat uh anthropic. I think there's chat oama. Um\nanthropic. I think there's chat oama. Um\nanthropic. I think there's chat oama. Um there's a lot of like in-built um\nthere's a lot of like in-built um\nthere's a lot of like in-built um libraries which lang chain offers which\nlibraries which lang chain offers which\nlibraries which lang chain offers which is great. Personally I've used chat\nis great. Personally I've used chat\nis great. Personally I've used chat openai a lot. I've also used chat\nopenai a lot. I've also used chat\nopenai a lot. I've also used chat anthropic a lot as well. Uh personally I\nanthropic a lot as well. Uh personally I\nanthropic a lot as well. Uh personally I like chat openai cuz it's just really\nlike chat openai cuz it's just really\nlike chat openai cuz it's just really simple to use. I've also used tried well\nsimple to use. I've also used tried well\nsimple to use. I've also used tried well tried to use chat oama before but really\ntried to use chat oama before but really\ntried to use chat oama before but really there's some difficulty in integrating\nthere's some difficulty in integrating\nthere's some difficulty in integrating it with lang. So that's why I've opted\nit with lang. So that's why I've opted\nit with lang. So that's why I've opted for openi. And if you're worried about\nfor openi. And if you're worried about\nfor openi. And if you're worried about financial cost, don't worry, it's\nfinancial cost, don't worry, it's\nfinancial cost, don't worry, it's extremely cheap. Uh if you want, you\nextremely cheap. Uh if you want, you\nextremely cheap. Uh if you want, you could also go for the GPD 40 mini model\ncould also go for the GPD 40 mini model\ncould also go for the GPD 40 mini model as well if that's a concern. But trust\nas well if that's a concern. But trust\nas well if that's a concern. But trust me, it's extremely cheap. Like the input\nme, it's extremely cheap. Like the input\nme, it's extremely cheap. Like the input tokens, output tokens is like in like\ntokens, output tokens is like in like\ntokens, output tokens is like in like tens of pennies for like a,000 tokens.\ntens of pennies for like a,000 tokens.\ntens of pennies for like a,000 tokens. So really, really cheap. Okay. So now\nSo really, really cheap. Okay. So now\nSo really, really cheap. Okay. So now let's actually define our node through\nlet's actually define our node through\nlet's actually define our node through our function. So\nour function. So\nour function. So process and we obviously define the\nprocess and we obviously define the\nprocess and we obviously define the state and then\nstate and then\nstate and then return the state like so. Perfect. Now\nreturn the state like so. Perfect. Now\nreturn the state like so. Perfect. Now how do we actually call the lm? Now lang\nhow do we actually call the lm? Now lang\nhow do we actually call the lm? Now lang chain and the langraph team really like\nchain and the langraph team really like\nchain and the langraph team really like using the word invoke. You might have\nusing the word invoke. You might have\nusing the word invoke. You might have noticed that to call a graph or like to\nnoticed that to call a graph or like to\nnoticed that to call a graph or like to make the graph run we've used invoke.\nmake the graph run we've used invoke.\nmake the graph run we've used invoke. Similarly to run the lm we use invoke as\nSimilarly to run the lm we use invoke as\nSimilarly to run the lm we use invoke as well. So we okay let's store the\nwell. So we okay let's store the\nwell. So we okay let's store the response we get in a variable. So uh\nresponse we get in a variable. So uh\nresponse we get in a variable. So uh lm.invoke and what do we invoke? Well,\nlm.invoke and what do we invoke? Well,\nlm.invoke and what do we invoke? Well, you can see from the uh hints here that\nyou can see from the uh hints here that\nyou can see from the uh hints here that it requires an input of language model\nit requires an input of language model\nit requires an input of language model input. What's that basically saying is\ninput. What's that basically saying is\ninput. What's that basically saying is what what what do you want the LM to do?\nwhat what what do you want the LM to do?\nwhat what what do you want the LM to do? Right? What's your question? Now what is\nRight? What's your question? Now what is\nRight? What's your question? Now what is our question? Well, that's in the\nour question? Well, that's in the\nour question? Well, that's in the messages. So we write state messages. So\nmessages. So we write state messages. So\nmessages. So we write state messages. So what will happen here is as soon as I've\nwhat will happen here is as soon as I've\nwhat will happen here is as soon as I've written state messages, let's say I have\nwritten state messages, let's say I have\nwritten state messages, let's say I have written hi or whatever uh we will pass\nwritten hi or whatever uh we will pass\nwritten hi or whatever uh we will pass this to the LLM through the invoke\nthis to the LLM through the invoke\nthis to the LLM through the invoke method. The LLM will then generate a\nmethod. The LLM will then generate a\nmethod. The LLM will then generate a response from its cloud server through\nresponse from its cloud server through\nresponse from its cloud server through our API and it'll get it will give us\nour API and it'll get it will give us\nour API and it'll get it will give us back the um its response and then we'll\nback the um its response and then we'll\nback the um its response and then we'll store it in the response section uh the\nstore it in the response section uh the\nstore it in the response section uh the response variable. Cool. And um let's\nresponse variable. Cool. And um let's\nresponse variable. Cool. And um let's actually print\nactually print\nactually print this like so and return the state like\nthis like so and return the state like\nthis like so and return the state like such. Okay, done. Now we obviously need\nsuch. Okay, done. Now we obviously need\nsuch. Okay, done. Now we obviously need to create the graph like such.\nto create the graph like such.\nto create the graph like such. Okay. So uh what is it saying? Well,\nOkay. So uh what is it saying? Well,\nOkay. So uh what is it saying? Well, it's saying that there is we've created\nit's saying that there is we've created\nit's saying that there is we've created a node process which is that which where\na node process which is that which where\na node process which is that which where the action is the process function. The\nthe action is the process function. The\nthe action is the process function. The add we've added an edge. We've added an\nadd we've added an edge. We've added an\nadd we've added an edge. We've added an edit from the start to the end node end\nedit from the start to the end node end\nedit from the start to the end node end point and we've compiled the graph.\npoint and we've compiled the graph.\npoint and we've compiled the graph. Okay. Um yeah. So let's now ask the for\nOkay. Um yeah. So let's now ask the for\nOkay. Um yeah. So let's now ask the for the user input. So user input is equal\nthe user input. So user input is equal\nthe user input. So user input is equal to input. We'll say enter\nto input. We'll say enter\nto input. We'll say enter something. And now we will invoke the\nsomething. And now we will invoke the\nsomething. And now we will invoke the agent cuz we need to invoke the agent of\nagent cuz we need to invoke the agent of\nagent cuz we need to invoke the agent of course because we're creating a graph,\ncourse because we're creating a graph,\ncourse because we're creating a graph, right? And the graph is well like agent\nright? And the graph is well like agent\nright? And the graph is well like agent in this case. Cool. Let's actually run\nin this case. Cool. Let's actually run\nin this case. Cool. Let's actually run this code now. So, Python\nthis code now. So, Python\nthis code now. So, Python agentbot.\nagentbot.\nagentbot. py and perfect. So, enter. Let's say\npy and perfect. So, enter. Let's say\npy and perfect. So, enter. Let's say hi. The AI message was hello, how can I\nhi. The AI message was hello, how can I\nhi. The AI message was hello, how can I assist you today? Now, I can reassure\nassist you today? Now, I can reassure\nassist you today? Now, I can reassure you I did not pre-code this or hardcode\nyou I did not pre-code this or hardcode\nyou I did not pre-code this or hardcode this. This is the actual LM. Let's run\nthis. This is the actual LM. Let's run\nthis. This is the actual LM. Let's run it uh one more time.\nit uh one more time.\nit uh one more time. Let's come up with a different message\nLet's come up with a different message\nLet's come up with a different message like who are\nyou and it'll say I'm an AI language\nyou and it'll say I'm an AI language model created by open AAI called chat\nmodel created by open AAI called chat\nmodel created by open AAI called chat GBT. So you can this basically pretty\nGBT. So you can this basically pretty\nGBT. So you can this basically pretty much confirms that yes this is GBT uh in\nmuch confirms that yes this is GBT uh in\nmuch confirms that yes this is GBT uh in the background. Okay, but\nthe background. Okay, but\nthe background. Okay, but um why why just stick to one message,\num why why just stick to one message,\num why why just stick to one message, right? Why not uh be able to run\nright? Why not uh be able to run\nright? Why not uh be able to run multiple message like asking multiple\nmultiple message like asking multiple\nmultiple message like asking multiple messages kind of like a chatbot, right?\nmessages kind of like a chatbot, right?\nmessages kind of like a chatbot, right? So this is the code which does this and\nSo this is the code which does this and\nSo this is the code which does this and I'll walk you through this what's\nI'll walk you through this what's\nI'll walk you through this what's happening here as well. So uh like\nhappening here as well. So uh like\nhappening here as well. So uh like before we input our query and now we\nbefore we input our query and now we\nbefore we input our query and now we basically say keep iterating through and\nbasically say keep iterating through and\nbasically say keep iterating through and as soon as the user has said like exit\nas soon as the user has said like exit\nas soon as the user has said like exit or something then uh well you exit the\nor something then uh well you exit the\nor something then uh well you exit the while loop and that basically signifies\nwhile loop and that basically signifies\nwhile loop and that basically signifies that well you don't want to talk to the\nthat well you don't want to talk to the\nthat well you don't want to talk to the ailm anymore. So let's have get run\nailm anymore. So let's have get run\nailm anymore. So let's have get run this. So python agentbot\nthis. So python agentbot\nthis. So python agentbot py. Okay let's say hi again. Hello how\npy. Okay let's say hi again. Hello how\npy. Okay let's say hi again. Hello how are you? But now we can run it again.\nare you? But now we can run it again.\nare you? But now we can run it again. It's just a simple y loop. It's nothing\nIt's just a simple y loop. It's nothing\nIt's just a simple y loop. It's nothing groundbreaking. So like who made\ngroundbreaking. So like who made\ngroundbreaking. So like who made you? Okay, perfect. What is 2 + 2? 2 + 2\nyou? Okay, perfect. What is 2 + 2? 2 + 2\nyou? Okay, perfect. What is 2 + 2? 2 + 2 equals 4. Okay. Uh let's say now, hi, I\nequals 4. Okay. Uh let's say now, hi, I\nequals 4. Okay. Uh let's say now, hi, I am\nBob. Okay, now watch this carefully. I'm\nBob. Okay, now watch this carefully. I'm about to ask what did I\nabout to ask what did I\nabout to ask what did I just well or I should say what is my\njust well or I should say what is my\njust well or I should say what is my name?\nname?\nname? I'm sorry, but I don't have the ability\nI'm sorry, but I don't have the ability\nI'm sorry, but I don't have the ability to know your name or any personal\nto know your name or any personal\nto know your name or any personal information about you. Why is\ninformation about you. Why is\ninformation about you. Why is that? Why didn't it know what my name\nthat? Why didn't it know what my name\nthat? Why didn't it know what my name is? Well, even though I clearly\nis? Well, even though I clearly\nis? Well, even though I clearly specified it. So, let's quickly\nspecified it. So, let's quickly\nspecified it. So, let's quickly exit. Okay, now this is important.\nexit. Okay, now this is important.\nexit. Okay, now this is important. Nowhere in the code have we actually\nNowhere in the code have we actually\nNowhere in the code have we actually created some sort of memory. That's why\ncreated some sort of memory.

Um I don't think there'll be any exercise for this cuz\nthere'll be any exercise for this cuz\nthere'll be any exercise for this cuz well there really isn't much to do with\nwell there really isn't much to do with\nwell there really isn't much to do with this. So I will see you in the\nthis. So I will see you in the\nthis. So I will see you in the introduction for the second AI agent\nintroduction for the second AI agent\nintroduction for the second AI agent we're going to build. Okay. So I'll see\nwe're going to build. Okay. So I'll see\nwe're going to build. Okay. So I'll see you\nyou\nyou there. Cool. Cool. Cool. Okay. So now\nthere. Cool. Cool. Cool. Okay. So now\nthere. Cool. Cool. Cool. Okay. So now we're going to build our second AI\nwe're going to build our second AI\nwe're going to build our second AI system. And we're going to try to fix\nsystem. And we're going to try to fix\nsystem. And we're going to try to fix the problems we faced in the last uh AI\nthe problems we faced in the last uh AI\nthe problems we faced in the last uh AI system we built. And what was the\nsystem we built. And what was the\nsystem we built. And what was the problem? Well, the problem was it\nproblem? Well, the problem was it\nproblem? Well, the problem was it doesn't remember what we in what we had\ndoesn't remember what we in what we had\ndoesn't remember what we in what we had said before, right? Why? Cuz we were\nsaid before, right? Why? Cuz we were\nsaid before, right? Why? Cuz we were calling separate API calls. So now we're\ncalling separate API calls. So now we're\ncalling separate API calls. So now we're going to try to create a chatbot with\ngoing to try to create a chatbot with\ngoing to try to create a chatbot with some sort of memory. That's why I\nsome sort of memory. That's why I\nsome sort of memory. That's why I included the brain emoji here. So let me\nincluded the brain emoji here. So let me\nincluded the brain emoji here. So let me walk through the objectives for this uh\nwalk through the objectives for this uh\nwalk through the objectives for this uh subsection. So, we're going to use\nsubsection. So, we're going to use\nsubsection. So, we're going to use different message types in particular in\ndifferent message types in particular in\ndifferent message types in particular in particular the human message and the AI\nparticular the human message and the AI\nparticular the human message and the AI message. We're going to maintain a full\nmessage. We're going to maintain a full\nmessage. We're going to maintain a full conversation history using both of these\nconversation history using both of these\nconversation history using both of these message types. We're going to\nmessage types. We're going to\nmessage types. We're going to particularly use the GPD4 model again\nparticularly use the GPD4 model again\nparticularly use the GPD4 model again using the lang chains uh chat open AI\nusing the lang chains uh chat open AI\nusing the lang chains uh chat open AI library and overall we're going to\nlibrary and overall we're going to\nlibrary and overall we're going to create a sophisticated conversation\ncreate a sophisticated conversation\ncreate a sophisticated conversation loop. So, what is the main goal goal of\nloop. So, what is the main goal goal of\nloop. So, what is the main goal goal of this um subsection? It's really to\nthis um subsection? It's really to\nthis um subsection? It's really to create a form of memory for our agent.\ncreate a form of memory for our agent.\ncreate a form of memory for our agent. So if you're ready, let's go to the\nSo if you're ready, let's go to the\nSo if you're ready, let's go to the code. All right, awesome people. So\ncode. All right, awesome people. So\ncode. All right, awesome people. So let's begin coding our simple chatbot\nlet's begin coding our simple chatbot\nlet's begin coding our simple chatbot then. Okay, so like last time, I've\nthen. Okay, so like last time, I've\nthen. Okay, so like last time, I've already imported all of the uh necessary\nalready imported all of the uh necessary\nalready imported all of the uh necessary libraries and it's largely this exact\nlibraries and it's largely this exact\nlibraries and it's largely this exact same except now I've added two more uh\nsame except now I've added two more uh\nsame except now I've added two more uh stuff. So the first is the AI message\nstuff. So the first is the AI message\nstuff. So the first is the AI message and I explained this in the introduction\nand I explained this in the introduction\nand I explained this in the introduction of this subsection why we need the AI\nof this subsection why we need the AI\nof this subsection why we need the AI message. And I've also imported the\nmessage. And I've also imported the\nmessage. And I've also imported the union type annotation. Now the union\nunion type annotation. Now the union\nunion type annotation. Now the union type annotation is something we covered\ntype annotation is something we covered\ntype annotation is something we covered in the first chapter. So if you if this\nin the first chapter. So if you if this\nin the first chapter. So if you if this is the first time you are looking at it\nis the first time you are looking at it\nis the first time you are looking at it or hearing about it, I would recommend\nor hearing about it, I would recommend\nor hearing about it, I would recommend you going to the first chapter really\nyou going to the first chapter really\nyou going to the first chapter really understanding and watching the first two\nunderstanding and watching the first two\nunderstanding and watching the first two chapters. They're quite short to be\nchapters. They're quite short to be\nchapters. They're quite short to be honest and then coming back. Okay. Now\nhonest and then coming back. Okay. Now\nhonest and then coming back. Okay. Now that being said, let's actually begin\nthat being said, let's actually begin\nthat being said, let's actually begin the uh coding then. Okay. So like\nthe uh coding then. Okay. So like\nthe uh coding then. Okay. So like always, we define the state. So class\nalways, we define the state. So class\nalways, we define the state. So class agent state\nagent state\nagent state uh typed dictionary. Perfect. Now last\nuh typed dictionary. Perfect. Now last\nuh typed dictionary. Perfect. Now last time what did we define this as? Again\ntime what did we define this as? Again\ntime what did we define this as? Again we're only going to have messages again\nwe're only going to have messages again\nwe're only going to have messages again but uh last time we had list human\nbut uh last time we had list human\nbut uh last time we had list human message. Okay so that was what we had\nmessage. Okay so that was what we had\nmessage. Okay so that was what we had defined as our agent state\ndefined as our agent state\ndefined as our agent state previously. Now this time we also want\npreviously. Now this time we also want\npreviously. Now this time we also want to include the AI message as well. We're\nto include the AI message as well. We're\nto include the AI message as well. We're building a more sophisticated chatbot.\nbuilding a more sophisticated chatbot.\nbuilding a more sophisticated chatbot. So how do we do that? Well, one way or\nSo how do we do that? Well, one way or\nSo how do we do that? Well, one way or the naive way is to really have it as\nthe naive way is to really have it as\nthe naive way is to really have it as messages\nmessages\nmessages AI list AI message or something like\nAI list AI message or something like\nAI list AI message or something like that. Something like that. And don't get\nthat. Something like that. And don't get\nthat. Something like that. And don't get me wrong, this is still a valid\nme wrong, this is still a valid\nme wrong, this is still a valid approach. You can still build your graph\napproach. You can still build your graph\napproach. You can still build your graph and everything like that, but um I think\nand everything like that, but um I think\nand everything like that, but um I think it's a bit longer. So let me tell you\nit's a bit longer. So let me tell you\nit's a bit longer. So let me tell you another way which would actually be\nanother way which would actually be\nanother way which would actually be better. So remove this. Instead, let's\nbetter. So remove this. Instead, let's\nbetter. So remove this. Instead, let's use the type annotation union like this.\nuse the type annotation union like this.\nuse the type annotation union like this. So,\nSo,\nSo, union like so. And let's include AI\nunion like so. And let's include AI\nunion like so. And let's include AI message. Now, what has this done?\nmessage. Now, what has this done?\nmessage. Now, what has this done? Essentially, let me first tell you about\nEssentially, let me first tell you about\nEssentially, let me first tell you about a bit about human message and AI\na bit about human message and AI\na bit about human message and AI message. Human message and AI messages\nmessage. Human message and AI messages\nmessage. Human message and AI messages and like all of these like different\nand like all of these like different\nand like all of these like different structures are actually data types in\nstructures are actually data types in\nstructures are actually data types in Langraph and Langchain. That's what the\nLangraph and Langchain. That's what the\nLangraph and Langchain. That's what the developers of these libraries have got\ndevelopers of these libraries have got\ndevelopers of these libraries have got them to be. And um when I write union\nthem to be. And um when I write union\nthem to be. And um when I write union human message AI message then that\nhuman message AI message then that\nhuman message AI message then that basically allows me to store uh either\nbasically allows me to store uh either\nbasically allows me to store uh either human messages or or AI messages in this\nhuman messages or or AI messages in this\nhuman messages or or AI messages in this uh key in the state the messages. So\nuh key in the state the messages. So\nuh key in the state the messages. So that's what that literally means in a\nthat's what that literally means in a\nthat's what that literally means in a nutshell. Now, one important thing which\nnutshell. Now, one important thing which\nnutshell. Now, one important thing which I want to mention is this. All of these\nI want to mention is this. All of these\nI want to mention is this. All of these AI agentic libraries like Langchain,\nAI agentic libraries like Langchain,\nAI agentic libraries like Langchain, Langraph, Crew AI, Autogen, they're all\nLangraph, Crew AI, Autogen, they're all\nLangraph, Crew AI, Autogen, they're all great, but um you really can make your\ngreat, but um you really can make your\ngreat, but um you really can make your own AI agentic system by writing just\nown AI agentic system by writing just\nown AI agentic system by writing just Python functions. You don't even need to\nPython functions. You don't even need to\nPython functions. You don't even need to use a library. Now that being said, I\nuse a library. Now that being said, I\nuse a library. Now that being said, I would still recommend using these\nwould still recommend using these\nwould still recommend using these libraries, especially Langraph because\nlibraries, especially Langraph because\nlibraries, especially Langraph because Langraph, well, because it's a personal\nLangraph, well, because it's a personal\nLangraph, well, because it's a personal favorite, no bias at all, but um it's\nfavorite, no bias at all, but um it's\nfavorite, no bias at all, but um it's Langraph really allows you to control\nLangraph really allows you to control\nLangraph really allows you to control much more than other libraries would.\nmuch more than other libraries would.\nmuch more than other libraries would. Obviously, not as much control as if you\nObviously, not as much control as if you\nObviously, not as much control as if you were writing the Python functions\nwere writing the Python functions\nwere writing the Python functions yourself and everything, but I think\nyourself and everything, but I think\nyourself and everything, but I think it's a good balance of how much control\nit's a good balance of how much control\nit's a good balance of how much control you have and how much uh unnecessary\nyou have and how much uh unnecessary\nyou have and how much uh unnecessary jargon you need to write. Because think\njargon you need to write. Because think\njargon you need to write. Because think about it, think about how much of um\nabout it, think about how much of um\nabout it, think about how much of um this unnecessary code which you would\nthis unnecessary code which you would\nthis unnecessary code which you would have had to write else otherwise uh\nhave had to write else otherwise uh\nhave had to write else otherwise uh langraph and lang chain support. So\nlangraph and lang chain support. So\nlangraph and lang chain support. So that's why I highly recommend using\nthat's why I highly recommend using\nthat's why I highly recommend using these libraries and everything. So again\nthese libraries and everything. So again\nthese libraries and everything. So again human message and AI message are data\nhuman message and AI message are data\nhuman message and AI message are data types inbuilt data types within uh lang\ntypes inbuilt data types within uh lang\ntypes inbuilt data types within uh lang lang graph and lang chain. Cool. Okay.\nlang graph and lang chain. Cool. Okay.\nlang graph and lang chain. Cool. Okay. Now let's again initialize the large\nNow let's again initialize the large\nNow let's again initialize the large language model as we did last time. And\nlanguage model as we did last time. And\nlanguage model as we did last time. And again we're only we're using GP4.\nagain we're only we're using GP4.\nagain we're only we're using GP4. Okay, now we're going to create our\nOkay, now we're going to create our\nOkay, now we're going to create our node. Again, it's going to be the exact\nnode. Again, it's going to be the exact\nnode. Again, it's going to be the exact same graph structure, by the way. So,\nsame graph structure, by the way. So,\nsame graph structure, by the way. So, state agent state, but obviously the\nstate agent state, but obviously the\nstate agent state, but obviously the actions we perform will be slightly\nactions we perform will be slightly\nactions we perform will be slightly different. Now, um let's write a dock\ndifferent. Now, um let's write a dock\ndifferent. Now, um let's write a dock string. This node will\nstring. This node will\nstring. This node will um this node will\num this node will\num this node will uh\nuh\nuh do solve the request you input\ndo solve the request you input\ndo solve the request you input something. Dog strings aren't really\nsomething. Dog strings aren't really\nsomething. Dog strings aren't really needed for this AI agent or this\nneeded for this AI agent or this\nneeded for this AI agent or this subsection because we're not going to\nsubsection because we're not going to\nsubsection because we're not going to use them. But um again, good habit.\nuse them. But um again, good habit.\nuse them. But um again, good habit. Okay, cool. Let's invoke\nOkay, cool. Let's invoke\nOkay, cool. Let's invoke this. So what have I done here? This is\nthis. So what have I done here? This is\nthis. So what have I done here? This is exactly the same code which we did in\nexactly the same code which we did in\nexactly the same code which we did in the previous subsection. The l we invoke\nthe previous subsection. The l we invoke\nthe previous subsection. The l we invoke the lm uh with the state messages. And\nthe lm uh with the state messages. And\nthe lm uh with the state messages. And what are the state messages? Well, it's\nwhat are the state messages? Well, it's\nwhat are the state messages? Well, it's could be either human message or an AI\ncould be either human message or an AI\ncould be either human message or an AI message. It's a list of those. Awesome.\nmessage. It's a list of those. Awesome.\nmessage. It's a list of those. Awesome. So now we write this piece of\nSo now we write this piece of\nSo now we write this piece of code. Okay. State messages.appen AI\ncode. Okay. State messages.appen AI\ncode. Okay. State messages.appen AI message content equal to\nmessage content equal to\nmessage content equal to response.content. What on earth is\nresponse.content. What on earth is\nresponse.content. What on earth is happening there? Okay. Let's break this\nhappening there? Okay. Let's break this\nhappening there? Okay. Let's break this down. Response. Well, that's just\ndown. Response. Well, that's just\ndown. Response. Well, that's just extracting only the content part of the\nextracting only the content part of the\nextracting only the content part of the response aka the response being the\nresponse aka the response being the\nresponse aka the response being the answer or the result after we make the\nanswer or the result after we make the\nanswer or the result after we make the uh API call from the large language\nuh API call from the large language\nuh API call from the large language model. And it only extracts the content.\nmodel. And it only extracts the content.\nmodel. And it only extracts the content. So it only extracts like the important\nSo it only extracts like the important\nSo it only extracts like the important stuff, right? It removes all the\nstuff, right? It removes all the\nstuff, right? It removes all the unnecessary jargon which comes with it\nunnecessary jargon which comes with it\nunnecessary jargon which comes with it like the amount of tokens you use and\nlike the amount of tokens you use and\nlike the amount of tokens you use and all that. It removes that and that's uh\nall that. It removes that and that's uh\nall that. It removes that and that's uh gets stored in that gets converted to to\ngets stored in that gets converted to to\ngets stored in that gets converted to to an AI message and that's appended to our\nan AI message and that's appended to our\nan AI message and that's appended to our state messages um in the state. Simple.\nstate messages um in the state. Simple.\nstate messages um in the state. Simple. Okay. Uh now obviously to make it look\nOkay. Uh now obviously to make it look\nOkay. Uh now obviously to make it look pretty in the terminal we're going to\npretty in the terminal we're going to\npretty in the terminal we're going to print this and then we're going to\nprint this and then we're going to\nprint this and then we're going to return the\nreturn the\nreturn the state. That's it. That's how simple it\nstate. That's it. That's how simple it\nstate. That's it. That's how simple it was.\nwas.\nwas. Okay, so now we're going to create this\nOkay, so now we're going to create this\nOkay, so now we're going to create this exact same graph. And that's why I've\nexact same graph. And that's why I've\nexact same graph. And that's why I've just copied and pasted it because it's a\njust copied and pasted it because it's a\njust copied and pasted it because it's a time waste of me rewriting the code in\ntime waste of me rewriting the code in\ntime waste of me rewriting the code in front of you again and again. So we can\nfront of you again and again. So we can\nfront of you again and again. So we can just reuse the same code because it's\njust reuse the same code because it's\njust reuse the same code because it's the exact same graph uh graph structure\nthe exact same graph uh graph structure\nthe exact same graph uh graph structure as the previous subsection. Cool. Okay,\nas the previous subsection. Cool. Okay,\nas the previous subsection. Cool. Okay, now we're going to now here's where it\nnow we're going to now here's where it\nnow we're going to now here's where it actually starts working differently.\nactually starts working differently.\nactually starts working differently. See, last time we didn't have this the\nSee, last time we didn't have this the\nSee, last time we didn't have this the conversation history. really this is\nconversation history. really this is\nconversation history. really this is what's going to be our memory in in um\nwhat's going to be our memory in in um\nwhat's going to be our memory in in um this uh setup. Okay, so we have now in\nthis uh setup. Okay, so we have now in\nthis uh setup. Okay, so we have now in initialized conversation history. Now\ninitialized conversation history. Now\ninitialized conversation history. Now again we're going to ask the user what\nagain we're going to ask the user what\nagain we're going to ask the user what they want, right? What's their request?\nthey want, right? What's their request?\nthey want, right? What's their request? So now we use this Y loop and this Y\nSo now we use this Y loop and this Y\nSo now we use this Y loop and this Y loop was the exact same loop we had in\nloop was the exact same loop we had in\nloop was the exact same loop we had in the previous subsection as well. uh it\nthe previous subsection as well. uh it\nthe previous subsection as well. uh it only exits unless if the user has uh\nonly exits unless if the user has uh\nonly exits unless if the user has uh inputed well exit obviously but now look\ninputed well exit obviously but now look\ninputed well exit obviously but now look at this the conversation history is\nat this the conversation history is\nat this the conversation history is appended with the human message and the\nappended with the human message and the\nappended with the human message and the human message is obviously the user\nhuman message is obviously the user\nhuman message is obviously the user input the reason I've kept on writing\ninput the reason I've kept on writing\ninput the reason I've kept on writing content is because well that's the\ncontent is because well that's the\ncontent is because well that's the parameter in human message as you can\nparameter in human message as you can\nparameter in human message as you can see\nsee\nsee here okay cool uh and we've invoked the\nhere okay cool uh and we've invoked the\nhere okay cool uh and we've invoked the agent what is the agent well the agent\nagent what is the agent well the agent\nagent what is the agent well the agent is the compiled version of the graph the\nis the compiled version of the graph the\nis the compiled version of the graph the compiled graph uh with uh the entire\ncompiled graph uh with uh the entire\ncompiled graph uh with uh the entire conversation history. Now this is\nconversation history. Now this is\nconversation history. Now this is important. The entire conversation\nimportant. The entire conversation\nimportant. The entire conversation history is sent, not just the current\nhistory is sent, not just the current\nhistory is sent, not just the current human message. So uh this will make more\nhuman message. So uh this will make more\nhuman message. So uh this will make more sense. Don't worry, I'm um trying my\nsense. Don't worry, I'm um trying my\nsense. Don't worry, I'm um trying my best to explain it right now, but\nbest to explain it right now, but\nbest to explain it right now, but obviously it will make much much more\nobviously it will make much much more\nobviously it will make much much more sense as soon as I start running it.\nsense as soon as I start running it.\nsense as soon as I start running it. Okay? So bear with me if you didn't\nOkay? So bear with me if you didn't\nOkay? So bear with me if you didn't fully understand that. Don't worry.\nfully understand that. Don't worry.\nfully understand that. Don't worry. Let's remove that for now.\nLet's remove that for now.\nLet's remove that for now. Uh, and then we replace the conversation\nUh, and then we replace the conversation\nUh, and then we replace the conversation history completely like wipe it with the\nhistory completely like wipe it with the\nhistory completely like wipe it with the result messages. Why? Don't worry, it's\nresult messages. Why? Don't worry, it's\nresult messages. Why? Don't worry, it's going to make sense as soon as I run it.\ngoing to make sense as soon as I run it.\ngoing to make sense as soon as I run it. And I think yeah, we should be able to\nAnd I think yeah, we should be able to\nAnd I think yeah, we should be able to run this now. So, let's\nrun this now. So, let's\nrun this now. So, let's write python memory agent.py, which is\nwrite python memory agent.py, which is\nwrite python memory agent.py, which is the name of the\nthe name of the\nthe name of the file. Cool. Okay, let me just quickly\nfile. Cool. Okay, let me just quickly\nfile. Cool. Okay, let me just quickly write a hi just to see if the API is\nwrite a hi just to see if the API is\nwrite a hi just to see if the API is working. It is perfect. Okay. Hello. How\nworking. It is perfect. Okay. Hello. How\nworking. It is perfect. Okay. Hello. How can I assist you today? Uh, now I'll say\ncan I assist you today? Uh, now I'll say\ncan I assist you today? Uh, now I'll say like, \"Hi, my name is\nSteve.\" Hi Steve, it's great to meet\nSteve.\" Hi Steve, it's great to meet you. How can I help you today? Okay, now\nyou. How can I help you today? Okay, now\nyou. How can I help you today? Okay, now remember from last time. Last time if I\nremember from last time. Last time if I\nremember from last time. Last time if I asked it, hey, who am I? It didn't know.\nasked it, hey, who am I? It didn't know.\nasked it, hey, who am I? It didn't know. Do you think it will know\nit. It does. you are Steve or at least\nit. It does. you are Steve or at least that's the name you've chosen to share\nthat's the name you've chosen to share\nthat's the name you've chosen to share with me. Uh and the rest is yes\nwith me. Uh and the rest is yes\nwith me. Uh and the rest is yes whatever. So it does know about what I\nwhatever. So it does know about what I\nwhatever. So it does know about what I have said but just looking at this code\nhave said but just looking at this code\nhave said but just looking at this code I guess you can try to like pick out\nI guess you can try to like pick out\nI guess you can try to like pick out okay how does it work and everything\nokay how does it work and everything\nokay how does it work and everything like why everything works like that but\nlike why everything works like that but\nlike why everything works like that but um I think we can add print statements\num I think we can add print statements\num I think we can add print statements and everything. So let's try to add\nand everything. So let's try to add\nand everything. So let's try to add print statements now and see well how\nprint statements now and see well how\nprint statements now and see well how this is actually working. So let's exit\nthis is actually working. So let's exit\nthis is actually working. So let's exit the program.\nOkay. Uh let's add a print statement\nOkay. Uh let's add a print statement here. Let me include this. Cool. So what\nhere. Let me include this. Cool. So what\nhere. Let me include this. Cool. So what is this saying? So this print statement\nis this saying? So this print statement\nis this saying? So this print statement actually kind think of it like a\nactually kind think of it like a\nactually kind think of it like a snapshot of what the current state is.\nsnapshot of what the current state is.\nsnapshot of what the current state is. So as soon as it goes into a process\nSo as soon as it goes into a process\nSo as soon as it goes into a process note as just before it's about to finish\nnote as just before it's about to finish\nnote as just before it's about to finish by returning the state, we also print\nby returning the state, we also print\nby returning the state, we also print the current state as well. And this will\nthe current state as well. And this will\nthe current state as well. And this will literally just output whatever is stored\nliterally just output whatever is stored\nliterally just output whatever is stored in the messages attribute within our\nin the messages attribute within our\nin the messages attribute within our state. Okay. So let's clear. There we\nstate. Okay. So let's clear. There we\nstate. Okay. So let's clear. There we go. Let's run this\ngo. Let's run this\ngo. Let's run this again. So hi, nice to meet you.\nagain. So hi, nice to meet you.\nagain. So hi, nice to meet you. Something like\nSomething like\nSomething like that. Now take a look at the current\nthat. Now take a look at the current\nthat. Now take a look at the current state. See it outputed hello, nice to\nstate. See it outputed hello, nice to\nstate. See it outputed hello, nice to meet you. How can I see you today? Why\nmeet you. How can I see you today? Why\nmeet you. How can I see you today? Why did it output that? Well, because in our\ndid it output that? Well, because in our\ndid it output that? Well, because in our process\nprocess\nprocess function it we've asked it we formatted\nfunction it we've asked it we formatted\nfunction it we've asked it we formatted it in a way so it says hey AI which is\nit in a way so it says hey AI which is\nit in a way so it says hey AI which is this part and the response or content is\nthis part and the response or content is\nthis part and the response or content is this part. Okay. Now this response or\nthis part. Okay. Now this response or\nthis part. Okay. Now this response or content is also what was stored remember\ncontent is also what was stored remember\ncontent is also what was stored remember how I said it's stored in the um in a\nhow I said it's stored in the um in a\nhow I said it's stored in the um in a nice manner and was appended to our\nnice manner and was appended to our\nnice manner and was appended to our state messages. Now was it appended to\nstate messages. Now was it appended to\nstate messages. Now was it appended to the state messages? Yes. How do you know\nthe state messages? Yes. How do you know\nthe state messages? Yes. How do you know that? Because look at the human message.\nthat? Because look at the human message.\nthat? Because look at the human message. The human message was what I wrote which\nThe human message was what I wrote which\nThe human message was what I wrote which was hi nice to meet you. Uh forget the\nwas hi nice to meet you. Uh forget the\nwas hi nice to meet you. Uh forget the additional keyword arguments and\nadditional keyword arguments and\nadditional keyword arguments and response metadata cuz I didn't provide\nresponse metadata cuz I didn't provide\nresponse metadata cuz I didn't provide any. Uh you don't need to worry about\nany. Uh you don't need to worry about\nany. Uh you don't need to worry about that. The main part is this part the\nthat. The main part is this part the\nthat. The main part is this part the content. And then look at the AI message\ncontent. And then look at the AI message\ncontent. And then look at the AI message part. Uh it's the content is equals to\npart. Uh it's the content is equals to\npart. Uh it's the content is equals to hello nice to meet you. How can I see\nhello nice to meet you. How can I see\nhello nice to meet you. How can I see you today? Notice how it's the exact\nyou today? Notice how it's the exact\nyou today? Notice how it's the exact same thing as it was\nsame thing as it was\nsame thing as it was here. Okay. Now, now we're going to go\nhere. Okay. Now, now we're going to go\nhere. Okay. Now, now we're going to go one step ahead and I'm going to ask it\none step ahead and I'm going to ask it\none step ahead and I'm going to ask it to\nto\nto say my name is Steve again. Now, think\nsay my name is Steve again. Now, think\nsay my name is Steve again. Now, think about how will this current state\nabout how will this current state\nabout how will this current state change? Pause the video and try to think\nchange? Pause the video and try to think\nchange? Pause the video and try to think about\nthis like that. Okay. So, now the second\nthis like that. Okay. So, now the second uh message I sent was my name is Steve.\nuh message I sent was my name is Steve.\nuh message I sent was my name is Steve. Its response for the second message was\nIts response for the second message was\nIts response for the second message was hi Steve. How can I help you today? Now\nhi Steve. How can I help you today? Now\nhi Steve. How can I help you today? Now look at the current state. It still\nlook at the current state. It still\nlook at the current state. It still begins with hi, nice to meet you, which\nbegins with hi, nice to meet you, which\nbegins with hi, nice to meet you, which was the first ever message I inputed\nwas the first ever message I inputed\nwas the first ever message I inputed into this conversation and then its\ninto this conversation and then its\ninto this conversation and then its respective AI message. And then that\nrespective AI message. And then that\nrespective AI message. And then that gets uh appended. Why appended? Well,\ngets uh appended. Why appended? Well,\ngets uh appended. Why appended? Well, because we had appended the AI message\nbecause we had appended the AI message\nbecause we had appended the AI message and appended the human\nand appended the human\nand appended the human message. So that's why. Okay. And you\nmessage. So that's why. Okay. And you\nmessage. So that's why. Okay. And you can see the human message is my name is\ncan see the human message is my name is\ncan see the human message is my name is Steve which is the most recent uh\nSteve which is the most recent uh\nSteve which is the most recent uh message which I put and then the AI\nmessage which I put and then the AI\nmessage which I put and then the AI message which is hi Steve how can I help\nmessage which is hi Steve how can I help\nmessage which is hi Steve how can I help you\nyou\nyou today? Perfect. And we can just keep\ntoday? Perfect. And we can just keep\ntoday? Perfect. And we can just keep going and going and going. But uh for\ngoing and going and going. But uh for\ngoing and going and going. But uh for now I'll\nnow I'll\nnow I'll exit. Now here's the thing. This works\nexit. Now here's the thing. This works\nexit. Now here's the thing. This works well relatively well, right? We've got\nwell relatively well, right? We've got\nwell relatively well, right? We've got it like as a chatbot which is what we\nit like as a chatbot which is what we\nit like as a chatbot which is what we wanted. it has some recollection of\nwanted. it has some recollection of\nwanted. it has some recollection of memory or or like of what we what we are\nmemory or or like of what we what we are\nmemory or or like of what we what we are who we are and everything. But there's\nwho we are and everything. But there's\nwho we are and everything. But there's two big problems here. Let's start with\ntwo big problems here. Let's start with\ntwo big problems here. Let's start with the first uh massive problem which is\nthe first uh massive problem which is\nthe first uh massive problem which is this. You know how I've exited the\nthis. You know how I've exited the\nthis. You know how I've exited the program right now. Yeah. Okay. I'm going\nprogram right now. Yeah. Okay. I'm going\nprogram right now. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to run the exact same program\nto run the exact same program\nto run the exact same program again. Now I told it that my name is\nagain. Now I told it that my name is\nagain. Now I told it that my name is Steve. What is my name?\nand it\nand it says uh I'm sorry I don't have access to\nsays uh I'm sorry I don't have access to\nsays uh I'm sorry I don't have access to your personal data. Okay. And look at\nyour personal data. Okay. And look at\nyour personal data. Okay. And look at the current state completely wiped out.\nthe current state completely wiped out.\nthe current state completely wiped out. Again, that's pretty self-explanatory as\nAgain, that's pretty self-explanatory as\nAgain, that's pretty self-explanatory as to why you exited the program and that's\nto why you exited the program and that's\nto why you exited the program and that's why obviously all the var the data was\nwhy obviously all the var the data was\nwhy obviously all the var the data was stored in the variables, right? The\nstored in the variables, right? The\nstored in the variables, right? The state was stored in the variables\nstate was stored in the variables\nstate was stored in the variables completely got wiped away. So what is\ncompletely got wiped away. So what is\ncompletely got wiped away. So what is the solution? Think about it.\nWell, obviously one potential solution\nWell, obviously one potential solution would be to store it in a database, like\nwould be to store it in a database, like\nwould be to store it in a database, like a large database, right? Or a vector\na large database, right? Or a vector\na large database, right? Or a vector database if you're trying to do some\ndatabase if you're trying to do some\ndatabase if you're trying to do some ragged applications. For now, I'm just\nragged applications. For now, I'm just\nragged applications. For now, I'm just going to store it in a very simple text\ngoing to store it in a very simple text\ngoing to store it in a very simple text file. Why? Cuz it's really easy. And\nfile. Why? Cuz it's really easy. And\nfile. Why? Cuz it's really easy. And I've got the code as well. And usually,\nI've got the code as well. And usually,\nI've got the code as well. And usually, honestly, I just store it in a text file\nhonestly, I just store it in a text file\nhonestly, I just store it in a text file when I'm prototyping. Now, yes,\nwhen I'm prototyping. Now, yes,\nwhen I'm prototyping. Now, yes, obviously, storing it in a vector\nobviously, storing it in a vector\nobviously, storing it in a vector database or a database is much more\ndatabase or a database is much more\ndatabase or a database is much more robust and sophisticated, and that is\nrobust and sophisticated, and that is\nrobust and sophisticated, and that is what you should do. But when you're\nwhat you should do. But when you're\nwhat you should do. But when you're prototyping and you want to really see\nprototyping and you want to really see\nprototyping and you want to really see uh try to build it quickly and fast, uh\nuh try to build it quickly and fast, uh\nuh try to build it quickly and fast, uh I just tend to use a text file. It still\nI just tend to use a text file. It still\nI just tend to use a text file. It still works uh still works great and\nworks uh still works great and\nworks uh still works great and everything. So what is the code for the\neverything. So what is the code for the\neverything. So what is the code for the text file? Uh it's\ntext file? Uh it's\ntext file? Uh it's here.\nhere.\nhere. Okay. So what is this code saying? Well,\nOkay. So what is this code saying? Well,\nOkay. So what is this code saying? Well, essentially it's saying create me a text\nessentially it's saying create me a text\nessentially it's saying create me a text file called logging as a as a text file\nfile called logging as a as a text file\nfile called logging as a as a text file you see in write mode and a file. Write\nyou see in write mode and a file. Write\nyou see in write mode and a file. Write your conversation log. This is just to\nyour conversation log. This is just to\nyour conversation log. This is just to like make it look better and more\nlike make it look better and more\nlike make it look better and more aesthetic. But this is the main part of\naesthetic. But this is the main part of\naesthetic. But this is the main part of the code which um you should actually\nthe code which um you should actually\nthe code which um you should actually try and understand for every single\ntry and understand for every single\ntry and understand for every single message in the conversation history.\nmessage in the conversation history.\nmessage in the conversation history. Okay. Now note the conversation history\nOkay. Now note the conversation history\nOkay. Now note the conversation history was this variable which we had like\nwas this variable which we had like\nwas this variable which we had like initialized the conversation history uh\ninitialized the conversation history uh\ninitialized the conversation history uh stores the AI messages and the human\nstores the AI messages and the human\nstores the AI messages and the human messages. So that's where all of the um\nmessages. So that's where all of the um\nmessages. So that's where all of the um the information outside the graph\nthe information outside the graph\nthe information outside the graph actually is. Right? the state is locked\nactually is. Right? the state is locked\nactually is. Right? the state is locked in within the graph now and uh the\nin within the graph now and uh the\nin within the graph now and uh the conversation history is just another I\nconversation history is just another I\nconversation history is just another I guess you can say a duplicate version of\nguess you can say a duplicate version of\nguess you can say a duplicate version of the state right because we've you we've\nthe state right because we've you we've\nthe state right because we've you we've appended the exact same human messages\nappended the exact same human messages\nappended the exact same human messages and AI messages and kept on updating it\nand AI messages and kept on updating it\nand AI messages and kept on updating it through this line cool so what it says\nthrough this line cool so what it says\nthrough this line cool so what it says is that for every single message in the\nis that for every single message in the\nis that for every single message in the conversation history by the way a\nconversation history by the way a\nconversation history by the way a conversation is the duration between my\nconversation is the duration between my\nconversation is the duration between my first message and the last message I\nfirst message and the last message I\nfirst message and the last message I sent that entire thing is a\nsent that entire thing is a\nsent that entire thing is a conversation. A conversation isn't just\nconversation. A conversation isn't just\nconversation. A conversation isn't just a single API call. It's the entire\na single API call. It's the entire\na single API call. It's the entire length. Okay? So, just to be mindful of\nlength. Okay? So, just to be mindful of\nlength. Okay? So, just to be mindful of that. So, uh it first checks if it's a\nthat. So, uh it first checks if it's a\nthat. So, uh it first checks if it's a human message, it writes that as you and\nhuman message, it writes that as you and\nhuman message, it writes that as you and then extracts that content and if it's\nthen extracts that content and if it's\nthen extracts that content and if it's the AI message, it uh puts it under the\nthe AI message, it uh puts it under the\nthe AI message, it uh puts it under the AI stuff. So, let's run this again. So,\nAI stuff. So, let's run this again. So,\nAI stuff. So, let's run this again. So, let's exit this. Clear this. Okay.\nWho? Okay, let's say hi, I am Steve.\nWho? Okay, let's say hi, I am Steve. Again, I'm using Steve because a\nAgain, I'm using Steve because a\nAgain, I'm using Steve because a Minecraft movie just came out, so that's\nMinecraft movie just came out, so that's\nMinecraft movie just came out, so that's why. Okay, now I'm going to\nwhy. Okay, now I'm going to\nwhy. Okay, now I'm going to intentionally make a spelling mistake\nintentionally make a spelling mistake\nintentionally make a spelling mistake here. Good morning. It should obviously\nhere. Good morning. It should obviously\nhere. Good morning. It should obviously morning should have been spelled, right?\nmorning should have been spelled, right?\nmorning should have been spelled, right? But I'm doing that for a reason. It gets\nBut I'm doing that for a reason. It gets\nBut I'm doing that for a reason. It gets no problem. Let's say tell me a joke.\nno problem. Let's say tell me a joke.\nno problem. Let's say tell me a joke. Just another random thing. Sure. Why\nJust another random thing. Sure. Why\nJust another random thing. Sure. Why don't skeletons fight each other? They\ndon't skeletons fight each other? They\ndon't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts.\ndon't have the guts.\ndon't have the guts. Um, really rubbish. My point is it\nUm, really rubbish. My point is it\nUm, really rubbish. My point is it works. Now I'll exit the program. And\nworks. Now I'll exit the program. And\nworks. Now I'll exit the program. And now it says conversation saved to\nnow it says conversation saved to\nnow it says conversation saved to login.xt. Now look at\nlogin.xt. Now look at\nlogin.xt. Now look at this. Remove that. Let me remove that.\nthis. Remove that. Let me remove that.\nthis. Remove that. Let me remove that. Okay, perfect. So this is the\nOkay, perfect. So this is the\nOkay, perfect. So this is the conversation log. The first message I\nconversation log. The first message I\nconversation log. The first message I ever sent was, \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" There,\never sent was, \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" There,\never sent was, \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" There, it's response. Now, good morning. Now,\nit's response. Now, good morning. Now,\nit's response. Now, good morning. Now, why did I spell it like wrong? Why did I\nwhy did I spell it like wrong? Why did I\nwhy did I spell it like wrong? Why did I do that? Because I wanted to show you\ndo that? Because I wanted to show you\ndo that? Because I wanted to show you that this is the actual human message,\nthat this is the actual human message,\nthat this is the actual human message, my message being stored unaltered. So\nmy message being stored unaltered. So\nmy message being stored unaltered. So whatever I pass in the state as a human\nwhatever I pass in the state as a human\nwhatever I pass in the state as a human message that stays there. So it's\nmessage that stays there. So it's\nmessage that stays there. So it's unaltered. The AI message cannot or or\nunaltered. The AI message cannot or or\nunaltered. The AI message cannot or or anything can really change the previous\nanything can really change the previous\nanything can really change the previous human messages at all. Right? So that's\nhuman messages at all. Right? So that's\nhuman messages at all. Right? So that's why. And you can see tell me a joke.\nwhy. And you can see tell me a joke.\nwhy.

Now, what was the second problem that I was\nwhat was the second problem that I was\nwhat was the second problem that I was mentioning? It's\nmentioning? It's\nmentioning? It's this. Look at how I initially I say,\nthis. Look at how I initially I say,\nthis. Look at how I initially I say, \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" I don't know why I\n\"Hi, I'm Steve.\" I don't know why I\n\"Hi, I'm Steve.\" I don't know why I printed twice there. Weird, but\nprinted twice there. Weird, but\nprinted twice there. Weird, but whatever. Look at the current state\nwhatever. Look at the current state\nwhatever. Look at the current state length.\nlength.\nlength. Okay. Then I pass in another message, it\nOkay. Then I pass in another message, it\nOkay. Then I pass in another message, it becomes longer.

But using so many tokens uh using so many tokens like input tokens\nusing so many tokens like input tokens\nusing so many tokens like input tokens especially will really eat away uh your\nespecially will really eat away uh your\nespecially will really eat away uh your uh the amount of money you will uh spend\nuh the amount of money you will uh spend\nuh the amount of money you will uh spend like it will drastically increase it and\nlike it will drastically increase it and\nlike it will drastically increase it and that's a huge problem right we want to\nthat's a huge problem right we want to\nthat's a huge problem right we want to try to be conservative a bit about our\ntry to be conservative a bit about our\ntry to be conservative a bit about our money and our financial our finances so\nmoney and our financial our finances so\nmoney and our financial our finances so what is one what is a way to solve this\nwhat is one what is a way to solve this\nwhat is one what is a way to solve this think about\nthat Well, right off the bat, I can give\nthat Well, right off the bat, I can give you an easy solution to implement which\nyou an easy solution to implement which\nyou an easy solution to implement which is within the code, write it, write some\nis within the code, write it, write some\nis within the code, write it, write some code where if the number of human\ncode where if the number of human\ncode where if the number of human messages exceeds five or something like\nmessages exceeds five or something like\nmessages exceeds five or something like that, then you remove the first human\nthat, then you remove the first human\nthat, then you remove the first human message in your uh history. Why remove\nmessage in your uh history. Why remove\nmessage in your uh history. Why remove the first and not the latest? Well,\nthe first and not the latest? Well,\nthe first and not the latest? Well, because the latest is most likely to be\nbecause the latest is most likely to be\nbecause the latest is most likely to be more relevant, right? The first message\nmore relevant, right? The first message\nmore relevant, right? The first message could is most likely to be the one where\ncould is most likely to be the one where\ncould is most likely to be the one where um the one which is well not needed or\num the one which is well not needed or\num the one which is well not needed or it could have been like it can it has\nit could have been like it can it has\nit could have been like it can it has more of a chance to be like a bit more\nmore of a chance to be like a bit more\nmore of a chance to be like a bit more less of an impact to have been removed.\nless of an impact to have been removed.\nless of an impact to have been removed. So why did I pick five? Well, five is\nSo why did I pick five? Well, five is\nSo why did I pick five? Well, five is just a random number I thought of. You\njust a random number I thought of. You\njust a random number I thought of. You could do 10, 15, 20, 25, three,\ncould do 10, 15, 20, 25, three,\ncould do 10, 15, 20, 25, three, whatever. But that's a really easy\nwhatever.

We learned how to\nquite a lot there. We learned how to\nquite a lot there. We learned how to integrate human message and AI message\nintegrate human message and AI message\nintegrate human message and AI message within a thing. And now we've created a\nwithin a thing.

Obviously, it has its flaws, but for\nObviously, it has its flaws, but for\nObviously, it has its flaws, but for now, it's pretty good. Okay, so now\nnow, it's pretty good. Okay, so now\nnow, it's pretty good. Okay, so now we're going to build our third AI agent.\nwe're going to build our third AI agent.\nwe're going to build our third AI agent. And this is going to be a special type\nAnd this is going to be a special type\nAnd this is going to be a special type of an AI agent.\nof an AI agent.\nof an AI agent. The technical term for this type of\nThe technical term for this type of\nThe technical term for this type of agent is called a react agent and react\nagent is called a react agent and react\nagent is called a react agent and react stands for reasoning and acting. So this\nstands for reasoning and acting. So this\nstands for reasoning and acting. So this is a quite a common type of AI agent\nis a quite a common type of AI agent\nis a quite a common type of AI agent which you will build. So how does it\nwhich you will build. So how does it\nwhich you will build. So how does it look like? Well, it looks something like\nlook like? Well, it looks something like\nlook like? Well, it looks something like this. So it's quite simple. There's a\nthis. So it's quite simple. There's a\nthis. So it's quite simple. There's a start point and then it's an end point\nstart point and then it's an end point\nstart point and then it's an end point obviously. Then you have your agent and\nobviously. Then you have your agent and\nobviously. Then you have your agent and then we use a loop where we attach it to\nthen we use a loop where we attach it to\nthen we use a loop where we attach it to tools. Now, this could be one tool, two\ntools. Now, this could be one tool, two\ntools. Now, this could be one tool, two tools, a lot of tools. And it's the\ntools, a lot of tools. And it's the\ntools, a lot of tools. And it's the agent's job or the LLM in the background\nagent's job or the LLM in the background\nagent's job or the LLM in the background to be able to decide which tool to\nto be able to decide which tool to\nto be able to decide which tool to select. But not only that, it's all it's\nselect. But not only that, it's all it's\nselect. But not only that, it's all it's also its job to be able to decide when\nalso its job to be able to decide when\nalso its job to be able to decide when there's no more tool calling left to do.\nthere's no more tool calling left to do.\nthere's no more tool calling left to do. And when that happens, it goes to the\nAnd when that happens, it goes to the\nAnd when that happens, it goes to the end part. So that's the general gist of\nend part. So that's the general gist of\nend part. So that's the general gist of what a React agent is. It's a very very\nwhat a React agent is. It's a very very\nwhat a React agent is. It's a very very common and famous type of agent to make\ncommon and famous type of agent to make\ncommon and famous type of agent to make in Langraph. And that's exactly what\nin Langraph. And that's exactly what\nin Langraph. And that's exactly what we're going to be building in this\nwe're going to be building in this\nwe're going to be building in this subsection. So what are the objectives?\nsubsection. So what are the objectives?\nsubsection. So what are the objectives?

Of course, we're going to be working with different\nwe're going to be working with different\nwe're going to be working with different types of messages such as tool messages.\ntypes of messages such as tool messages.\ntypes of messages such as tool messages. See, last subsection we've we covered AI\nSee, last subsection we've we covered AI\nSee, last subsection we've we covered AI messages, human messages, but now we're\nmessages, human messages, but now we're\nmessages, human messages, but now we're going to look at a lot more types of\ngoing to look at a lot more types of\ngoing to look at a lot more types of messages. for example, tool messages,\nmessages. for example, tool messages,\nmessages. for example, tool messages, system messages, base messages, and\nsystem messages, base messages, and\nsystem messages, base messages, and we're obviously going to test our\nwe're obviously going to test our\nwe're obviously going to test our robustness um of our graph.

So, the main goal is to create a robust React agent.\ngoal is to create a robust React agent.\ngoal is to create a robust React agent. So, if you're excited, I'll see you at\nSo, if you're excited, I'll see you at\nSo, if you're excited, I'll see you at the\nthe\nthe code. Okay, people. So, now we're going\ncode. Okay, people. So, now we're going\ncode. Okay, people. So, now we're going to code up the React agent. And just a\nto code up the React agent. And just a\nto code up the React agent. And just a heads up, this is going to be quite a\nheads up, this is going to be quite a\nheads up, this is going to be quite a long subsection. So, get ready. You can\nlong subsection. So, get ready. You can\nlong subsection. So, get ready. You can see it's going to be long because of how\nsee it's going to be long because of how\nsee it's going to be long because of how many imports I've done. But because I've\nmany imports I've done. But because I've\nmany imports I've done. But because I've done so many new imports, I actually\ndone so many new imports, I actually\ndone so many new imports, I actually want to take some time off and really\nwant to take some time off and really\nwant to take some time off and really explain each line so that we're all on\nexplain each line so that we're all on\nexplain each line so that we're all on the same page. Okay, let's go. So the\nthe same page. Okay, let's go. So the\nthe same page. Okay, let's go. So the first line is from typing import\nfirst line is from typing import\nfirst line is from typing import annotated sequence and type dictionary.\nannotated sequence and type dictionary.\nannotated sequence and type dictionary. Now we obviously know what a type\nNow we obviously know what a type\nNow we obviously know what a type dictionary is, but we haven't come\ndictionary is, but we haven't come\ndictionary is, but we haven't come across annotated or sequence yet. So\nacross annotated or sequence yet. So\nacross annotated or sequence yet. So these are also type annotations. And\nthese are also type annotations. And\nthese are also type annotations. And I'll start off by explaining what an\nI'll start off by explaining what an\nI'll start off by explaining what an annotated is. So annotated is a type\nannotated is. So annotated is a type\nannotated is. So annotated is a type annotation which provides additional\nannotation which provides additional\nannotation which provides additional context to your uh variable or your key\ncontext to your uh variable or your key\ncontext to your uh variable or your key without actually affecting the type\nwithout actually affecting the type\nwithout actually affecting the type itself, the data type itself. Now what\nitself, the data type itself. Now what\nitself, the data type itself. Now what exactly does that mean? Well, I'll give\nexactly does that mean? Well, I'll give\nexactly does that mean? Well, I'll give you an example. Let's say I am trying to\nyou an example. Let's say I am trying to\nyou an example. Let's say I am trying to create a type dictionary where there is\ncreate a type dictionary where there is\ncreate a type dictionary where there is an email key in it. Okay? Now, obviously\nan email key in it. Okay? Now, obviously\nan email key in it. Okay? Now, obviously an email is string. So if I was to\nan email is string. So if I was to\nan email is string. So if I was to create a type dictionary, I would have\ncreate a type dictionary, I would have\ncreate a type dictionary, I would have written email colon string, right? Sl.\nwritten email colon string, right? Sl.\nwritten email colon string, right? Sl. That's how we've been doing it. But\nThat's how we've been doing it. But\nThat's how we've been doing it. But here's the thing with certain keys like\nhere's the thing with certain keys like\nhere's the thing with certain keys like email, they have to be a certain uh\nemail, they have to be a certain uh\nemail, they have to be a certain uh format. But like for example, it has to\nformat. But like for example, it has to\nformat. But like for example, it has to be like\nbe like\nbe like abcgmail.com for example. But if I pass\nabcgmail.com for example. But if I pass\nabcgmail.com for example. But if I pass in\nin\nin abcd-gmail.com or something like that,\nabcd-gmail.com or something like that,\nabcd-gmail.com or something like that, that's not a valid email format anymore,\nthat's not a valid email format anymore,\nthat's not a valid email format anymore, but it's still a string technically. So\nbut it's still a string technically. So\nbut it's still a string technically. So it would pass through. So how do we\nit would pass through. So how do we\nit would pass through. So how do we resolve that? Well, that's where\nresolve that? Well, that's where\nresolve that? Well, that's where annotated comes in. And I'll give you an\nannotated comes in. And I'll give you an\nannotated comes in. And I'll give you an example here. Let's say email is equal\nexample here. Let's say email is equal\nexample here. Let's say email is equal to annotated. I'm not going to create\nto annotated. I'm not going to create\nto annotated. I'm not going to create the whole type dictionary to save time.\nthe whole type dictionary to save time.\nthe whole type dictionary to save time. But for uh the example itself, you first\nBut for uh the example itself, you first\nBut for uh the example itself, you first pass in what data type you want it to\npass in what data type you want it to\npass in what data type you want it to be. So we want email to be a string,\nbe. So we want email to be a string,\nbe. So we want email to be a string, right? That's not changing. But here in\nright? That's not changing. But here in\nright? That's not changing. But here in quotation marks, I provide some more\nquotation marks, I provide some more\nquotation marks, I provide some more additional information, additional\nadditional information, additional\nadditional information, additional context. And this is basically adding\ncontext. And this is basically adding\ncontext. And this is basically adding onto the metadata of this key or\nonto the metadata of this key or\nonto the metadata of this key or variable. For example, uh let's say this\nvariable. For example, uh let's say this\nvariable. For example, uh let's say this has to be\nhas to be\nhas to be a valid email\na valid email\na valid email format. Now, obviously, I should do it\nformat. Now, obviously, I should do it\nformat. Now, obviously, I should do it in more detail, but um that's how uh for\nin more detail, but um that's how uh for\nin more detail, but um that's how uh for now, that's fine. So, how how can I\nnow, that's fine. So, how how can I\nnow, that's fine. So, how how can I actually see the metadata? So, if I want\nactually see the metadata? So, if I want\nactually see the metadata? So, if I want to, I would write print\nto, I would write print\nto, I would write print email metadata\nemail metadata\nemail metadata uh like that. And then I would press\nuh like that. And then I would press\nuh like that. And then I would press run. And here we go. You can see this\nrun. And here we go. You can see this\nrun. And here we go. You can see this has to be a valid email format. That's\nhas to be a valid email format. That's\nhas to be a valid email format. That's the exact same thing which is which we\nthe exact same thing which is which we\nthe exact same thing which is which we wrote here. So that's annotated done.\nwrote here. So that's annotated done.\nwrote here. So that's annotated done. But what about sequence? What does\nBut what about sequence? What does\nBut what about sequence? What does sequence mean? Well, sequence is also a\nsequence mean? Well, sequence is also a\nsequence mean? Well, sequence is also a type annotation. And the way I've\ntype annotation. And the way I've\ntype annotation. And the way I've described it is here. It basically\ndescribed it is here. It basically\ndescribed it is here. It basically automatically handles the state updates\nautomatically handles the state updates\nautomatically handles the state updates for sequences such as by adding new\nfor sequences such as by adding new\nfor sequences such as by adding new messages to a chat history. Now what\nmessages to a chat history. Now what\nmessages to a chat history. Now what does that mean? Well, it's really just\ndoes that mean? Well, it's really just\ndoes that mean? Well, it's really just there to avoid any list manipulation to\nthere to avoid any list manipulation to\nthere to avoid any list manipulation to the graph nodes. Obviously, like when\nthe graph nodes. Obviously, like when\nthe graph nodes. Obviously, like when we're using graphs and nodes and all all\nwe're using graphs and nodes and all all\nwe're using graphs and nodes and all all of that stuff and updating the states,\nof that stuff and updating the states,\nof that stuff and updating the states, there's a lot of uh list manipulations\nthere's a lot of uh list manipulations\nthere's a lot of uh list manipulations which we'll have to do. Sequence really\nwhich we'll have to do. Sequence really\nwhich we'll have to do. Sequence really handles a lot of that. So, that's really\nhandles a lot of that. So, that's really\nhandles a lot of that. So, that's really what it's there for. You don't really\nwhat it's there for. You don't really\nwhat it's there for. You don't really need to uh worry about it too much.\nneed to uh worry about it too much.\nneed to uh worry about it too much. Okay. Now, if we continue, we have env\nOkay. Now, if we continue, we have env\nOkay. Now, if we continue, we have env uh from import loadenv. From last time,\nuh from import loadenv. From last time,\nuh from import loadenv. From last time, we know that this is just to store our\nwe know that this is just to store our\nwe know that this is just to store our API keys and I've done that here. That\nAPI keys and I've done that here. That\nAPI keys and I've done that here. That will load the API keys. But you'll see\nwill load the API keys. But you'll see\nwill load the API keys. But you'll see now these three uh imports. We're\nnow these three uh imports. We're\nnow these three uh imports. We're importing some new message types here.\nimporting some new message types here.\nimporting some new message types here. So we're importing base message, tool\nSo we're importing base message, tool\nSo we're importing base message, tool message, and system message. I'll start\nmessage, and system message. I'll start\nmessage, and system message. I'll start off with the tool message. So it's\noff with the tool message. So it's\noff with the tool message. So it's essentially a type of message where\nessentially a type of message where\nessentially a type of message where where the data is passed back to the LM\nwhere the data is passed back to the LM\nwhere the data is passed back to the LM after the tool has been called and like\nafter the tool has been called and like\nafter the tool has been called and like the information which is passed is like\nthe information which is passed is like\nthe information which is passed is like the content itself, the tool call ID. Uh\nthe content itself, the tool call ID. Uh\nthe content itself, the tool call ID. Uh that's what tool messages. It's pretty\nthat's what tool messages. It's pretty\nthat's what tool messages. It's pretty self-explanatory. Now for a system\nself-explanatory. Now for a system\nself-explanatory. Now for a system message, it's the it's a message for\nmessage, it's the it's a message for\nmessage, it's the it's a message for providing instructions to the LLM. So\nproviding instructions to the LLM. So\nproviding instructions to the LLM. So like for example, if you've used uh LLM\nlike for example, if you've used uh LLM\nlike for example, if you've used uh LLM APIs before, you might have written you\nAPIs before, you might have written you\nAPIs before, you might have written you are a helpful assistant. That's exactly\nare a helpful assistant. That's exactly\nare a helpful assistant. That's exactly what a system message is. And don't\nwhat a system message is. And don't\nwhat a system message is. And don't worry, we're going to code this up as\nworry, we're going to code this up as\nworry, we're going to code this up as well. So you'll actually see what they\nwell. So you'll actually see what they\nwell. So you'll actually see what they are. Now what's a base message? So in\nare. Now what's a base message? So in\nare. Now what's a base message? So in the comments, you can see that I've\nthe comments, you can see that I've\nthe comments, you can see that I've written the foundational class for all\nwritten the foundational class for all\nwritten the foundational class for all message types in Langraph. Now here's\nmessage types in Langraph. Now here's\nmessage types in Langraph. Now here's how this works. Think about the class\nhow this works. Think about the class\nhow this works. Think about the class hierarchy. So you know how you have a\nhierarchy. So you know how you have a\nhierarchy. So you know how you have a parent class and then you have child\nparent class and then you have child\nparent class and then you have child classes as well. Well the base message\nclasses as well. Well the base message\nclasses as well. Well the base message would be the parent class and these uh\nwould be the parent class and these uh\nwould be the parent class and these uh AI message, human message, tool message,\nAI message, human message, tool message,\nAI message, human message, tool message, system message and all these other types\nsystem message and all these other types\nsystem message and all these other types of message will be like the child\nof message will be like the child\nof message will be like the child classes and they will inherit all the\nclasses and they will inherit all the\nclasses and they will inherit all the properties of the base message cuz\nproperties of the base message cuz\nproperties of the base message cuz that's the parent one. I guess you can\nthat's the parent one. I guess you can\nthat's the parent one. I guess you can say the uh all father or something but\nsay the uh all father or something but\nsay the uh all father or something but the AI message, human message and all\nthe AI message, human message and all\nthe AI message, human message and all these child uh classes obviously they'll\nthese child uh classes obviously they'll\nthese child uh classes obviously they'll have their own properties, right? For\nhave their own properties, right? For\nhave their own properties, right? For example, the tool message has its own\nexample, the tool message has its own\nexample, the tool message has its own content and tool call ID and all that\ncontent and tool call ID and all that\ncontent and tool call ID and all that stuff. So that's what the base message\nstuff. So that's what the base message\nstuff. So that's what the base message is. It's really the foundational class\nis. It's really the foundational class\nis. It's really the foundational class for all the message types in\nfor all the message types in\nfor all the message types in Langraph. Cool. Okay. So now if we\nLangraph. Cool. Okay. So now if we\nLangraph. Cool. Okay. So now if we continue, you can see we've imported\ncontinue, you can see we've imported\ncontinue, you can see we've imported chat, openAI.

These we've come across. We know what they are. And we've imported tool\nwhat they are. And we've imported tool\nwhat they are. And we've imported tool and tool nodes which we cover in the\nand tool nodes which we cover in the\nand tool nodes which we cover in the second chapter or second section of this\nsecond chapter or second section of this\nsecond chapter or second section of this course. uh these are different elements\ncourse. uh these are different elements\ncourse. uh these are different elements which we're going to be uh using in\nwhich we're going to be uh using in\nwhich we're going to be uh using in langraph. Now what about this line from\nlangraph. Now what about this line from\nlangraph. Now what about this line from langraph dossage import add messages.\nlangraph dossage import add messages.\nlangraph dossage import add messages. Now what does that mean? So this is a\nNow what does that mean? So this is a\nNow what does that mean? So this is a little bit um different. This add\nlittle bit um different. This add\nlittle bit um different. This add messages is a reducer function. Now if\nmessages is a reducer function. Now if\nmessages is a reducer function. Now if this is the first time you're hearing\nthis is the first time you're hearing\nthis is the first time you're hearing that don't panic. It's not that hard. So\nthat don't panic. It's not that hard. So\nthat don't panic. It's not that hard. So let's let me copy this one second. Okay.\nlet's let me copy this one second. Okay.\nlet's let me copy this one second. Okay. So a reducer function is essentially\nSo a reducer function is essentially\nSo a reducer function is essentially just a rule that controls how updates\njust a rule that controls how updates\njust a rule that controls how updates from nodes are combined with the\nfrom nodes are combined with the\nfrom nodes are combined with the existing state. In simpler words, it\nexisting state. In simpler words, it\nexisting state. In simpler words, it really just tells us how to merge new\nreally just tells us how to merge new\nreally just tells us how to merge new data into the current state. Now here's\ndata into the current state. Now here's\ndata into the current state. Now here's the thing. If we didn't have some sort\nthe thing. If we didn't have some sort\nthe thing. If we didn't have some sort of a reducer function, uh updates would\nof a reducer function, uh updates would\nof a reducer function, uh updates would have just replaced the existing value or\nhave just replaced the existing value or\nhave just replaced the existing value or state entirely. And I'll give you an\nstate entirely. And I'll give you an\nstate entirely. And I'll give you an example for this.\nSo let's say I had a state where it was\nSo let's say I had a state where it was just high. I had one attribute messages\njust high. I had one attribute messages\njust high. I had one attribute messages and high. Now obviously I should have\nand high. Now obviously I should have\nand high. Now obviously I should have created the type dictionary and\ncreated the type dictionary and\ncreated the type dictionary and everything and formalize it but just for\neverything and formalize it but just for\neverything and formalize it but just for simpler um for times saving purposes\nsimpler um for times saving purposes\nsimpler um for times saving purposes I've done it like this. Now what if I\nI've done it like this. Now what if I\nI've done it like this. Now what if I had an update which says nice to meet\nhad an update which says nice to meet\nhad an update which says nice to meet you. If I didn't have a reducer function\nyou. If I didn't have a reducer function\nyou. If I didn't have a reducer function that would completely overwrite it. Now\nthat would completely overwrite it. Now\nthat would completely overwrite it. Now in the previous uh graphs and agents\nin the previous uh graphs and agents\nin the previous uh graphs and agents we've made we've appended it but now\nwe've made we've appended it but now\nwe've made we've appended it but now that we're using so many different\nthat we're using so many different\nthat we're using so many different messages and calls and tool calling and\nmessages and calls and tool calling and\nmessages and calls and tool calling and what\nwhat\nwhat whatever we can't really always append\nwhatever we can't really always append\nwhatever we can't really always append everything like it will get far too\neverything like it will get far too\neverything like it will get far too complicated. So that's why we need to\ncomplicated. So that's why we need to\ncomplicated. So that's why we need to leverage reducer function. So if we\nleverage reducer function. So if we\nleverage reducer function. So if we didn't use a reducer function it would\ndidn't use a reducer function it would\ndidn't use a reducer function it would just overwrite it completely. But if we\njust overwrite it completely. But if we\njust overwrite it completely. But if we did like hi nice to meet you it would\ndid like hi nice to meet you it would\ndid like hi nice to meet you it would append it. That's the key. So in a\nappend it. That's the key. So in a\nappend it. That's the key. So in a nutshell, the reducer function really\nnutshell, the reducer function really\nnutshell, the reducer function really just aggregates the uh data in the\njust aggregates the uh data in the\njust aggregates the uh data in the state. This reducer function uh and the\nstate. This reducer function uh and the\nstate. This reducer function uh and the reducer function which I'm talking about\nreducer function which I'm talking about\nreducer function which I'm talking about is add messages. So once again, add\nis add messages. So once again, add\nis add messages. So once again, add messages is a reducer function that will\nmessages is a reducer function that will\nmessages is a reducer function that will really just allow us to append\nreally just allow us to append\nreally just allow us to append everything into the state without any\neverything into the state without any\neverything into the state without any overring happening cuz so we want to\noverring happening cuz so we want to\noverring happening cuz so we want to preserve the state. Okay, cool. So now\npreserve the state. Okay, cool. So now\npreserve the state. Okay, cool. So now let's actually code this uh react agent.\nlet's actually code this uh react agent.\nlet's actually code this uh react agent. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay, I've\nOkay. All right. Okay. Okay, I've\nOkay. All right. Okay. Okay, I've cleared the screen now and let's\ncleared the screen now and let's\ncleared the screen now and let's actually begin like we how we always\nactually begin like we how we always\nactually begin like we how we always begin with the uh creation of our state\nbegin with the uh creation of our state\nbegin with the uh creation of our state of our agent. So, type dictionary like\nof our agent. So, type dictionary like\nof our agent. So, type dictionary like such. Okay. And now we we'll only have\nsuch. Okay. And now we we'll only have\nsuch. Okay. And now we we'll only have one key in this uh in this example which\none key in this uh in this example which\none key in this uh in this example which is just messages. And now let's use the\nis just messages. And now let's use the\nis just messages. And now let's use the new type annotations we've learned. So,\nnew type annotations we've learned. So,\nnew type annotations we've learned. So, sequence base message and reducer\nsequence base message and reducer\nsequence base message and reducer function add messages. So again this\nfunction add messages. So again this\nfunction add messages. So again this piece of code is saying to preserve the\npiece of code is saying to preserve the\npiece of code is saying to preserve the state by actually appending it rather\nstate by actually appending it rather\nstate by actually appending it rather than overwriting. That's what this\nthan overwriting. That's what this\nthan overwriting. That's what this reducer function does. Okay. All right.\nreducer function does. Okay. All right.\nreducer function does. Okay. All right. Okay. Oh, and the sequence of base\nOkay. Oh, and the sequence of base\nOkay. Oh, and the sequence of base messages is the data type and this\nmessages is the data type and this\nmessages is the data type and this provides the metadata. That's why we\nprovides the metadata. That's why we\nprovides the metadata. That's why we have the annotated keyword here. That's\nhave the annotated keyword here. That's\nhave the annotated keyword here. That's really it. Okay. Uh now let's create our\nreally it. Okay. Uh now let's create our\nreally it. Okay. Uh now let's create our first ever tool. Now how do we do this?\nfirst ever tool. Now how do we do this?\nfirst ever tool. Now how do we do this? Some of you who have a um who have come\nSome of you who have a um who have come\nSome of you who have a um who have come from lang chain might know how to do\nfrom lang chain might know how to do\nfrom lang chain might know how to do this already. We use a decorator and we\nthis already. We use a decorator and we\nthis already. We use a decorator and we define like this. Now this decorator\ndefine like this. Now this decorator\ndefine like this. Now this decorator basically tells Python that this\nbasically tells Python that this\nbasically tells Python that this function is quite is special. It does\nfunction is quite is special. It does\nfunction is quite is special. It does something and well it is special because\nsomething and well it is special because\nsomething and well it is special because it's a tool which we're going to use. So\nit's a tool which we're going to use. So\nit's a tool which we're going to use. So let's define our tool as def. Let's\nlet's define our tool as def. Let's\nlet's define our tool as def. Let's create a simple addition tool. Okay. So\ncreate a simple addition tool. Okay. So\ncreate a simple addition tool. Okay. So we'll say a integer b integer.\nwe'll say a integer b integer.\nwe'll say a integer b integer. It's basically going to add two numbers.\nIt's basically going to add two numbers.\nIt's basically going to add two numbers. And this is where doc strings actually\nAnd this is where doc strings actually\nAnd this is where doc strings actually come now. And I'll show you how\ncome now. And I'll show you how\ncome now. And I'll show you how important they are. For now, let's say\nimportant they are. For now, let's say\nimportant they are. For now, let's say uh this is an addition\nuh this is an addition\nuh this is an addition function\nfunction\nfunction that adds two numbers together.\nthat adds two numbers together.\nthat adds two numbers together. Okay. All right. And we just return a\nOkay. All right. And we just return a\nOkay. All right. And we just return a plus\nplus\nplus b. Simple. Now, how can we actually\nb. Simple. Now, how can we actually\nb. Simple. Now, how can we actually infuse these tools to our large language\ninfuse these tools to our large language\ninfuse these tools to our large language model? Well, first let's create a list.\nmodel? Well, first let's create a list.\nmodel? Well, first let's create a list. Add like such. Now, yes, at this current\nAdd like such. Now, yes, at this current\nAdd like such. Now, yes, at this current moment, I only have one tool, but in a\nmoment, I only have one tool, but in a\nmoment, I only have one tool, but in a few moments, we'll have multiple tools.\nfew moments, we'll have multiple tools.\nfew moments, we'll have multiple tools. That's why I'm adding this uh list for\nThat's why I'm adding this uh list for\nThat's why I'm adding this uh list for now. And let's actually create our\nnow. And let's actually create our\nnow. And let's actually create our model. So, model is equal to chat\nmodel. So, model is equal to chat\nmodel. So, model is equal to chat openai. Model is equal to\nopenai. Model is equal to\nopenai. Model is equal to GPT40. Again, I'm using GPD40 because\nGPT40. Again, I'm using GPD40 because\nGPT40. Again, I'm using GPD40 because I've never had a problem with it to be\nI've never had a problem with it to be\nI've never had a problem with it to be honest. So how can we tell our GPD40\nhonest. So how can we tell our GPD40\nhonest. So how can we tell our GPD40 large language model that these are the\nlarge language model that these are the\nlarge language model that these are the tools you can use? Well, we can use this\ntools you can use? Well, we can use this\ntools you can use? Well, we can use this inbuilt Python um inbuilt function\ninbuilt Python um inbuilt function\ninbuilt Python um inbuilt function called bind tools. Bind tools like that.\ncalled bind tools. Bind tools like that.\ncalled bind tools. Bind tools like that. And we pass in the list of tools we\nAnd we pass in the list of tools we\nAnd we pass in the list of tools we have. So that's tools. Pretty simple,\nhave. So that's tools. Pretty simple,\nhave. So that's tools. Pretty simple, right? Okay. So now large language model\nright? Okay. So now large language model\nright? Okay. So now large language model will have access to all of our\nwill have access to all of our\nwill have access to all of our tools. Okay. So now we need to create a\ntools. Okay. So now we need to create a\ntools. Okay. So now we need to create a node which actually acts as the agent\nnode which actually acts as the agent\nnode which actually acts as the agent within our graph. So how do we do that?\nwithin our graph. So how do we do that?\nwithin our graph. So how do we do that? Let me create just a simple function\nLet me create just a simple function\nLet me create just a simple function like def model call. We pass in the\nlike def model call. We pass in the\nlike def model call. We pass in the state agent state. Again it needs to\nstate agent state. Again it needs to\nstate agent state. Again it needs to return the agent\nreturn the agent\nreturn the agent state.\nstate.\nstate. Okay. Now I'm going to quickly copy this\nOkay. Now I'm going to quickly copy this\nOkay. Now I'm going to quickly copy this piece of code. Give me a\nsecond. Okay. So what is this code\nsecond. Okay. So what is this code doing?\ndoing?\ndoing? uh you can see that we're invoking the\nuh you can see that we're invoking the\nuh you can see that we're invoking the model aka running the model and this is\nmodel aka running the model and this is\nmodel aka running the model and this is the system message which we are asking.\nthe system message which we are asking.\nthe system message which we are asking. So we're explicitly saying the large\nSo we're explicitly saying the large\nSo we're explicitly saying the large language model that you are my a system\nlanguage model that you are my a system\nlanguage model that you are my a system please answer my query to the best of\nplease answer my query to the best of\nplease answer my query to the best of your ability. So that's what the large\nyour ability. So that's what the large\nyour ability. So that's what the large language model's task is to do. Now if\nlanguage model's task is to do. Now if\nlanguage model's task is to do. Now if we want to get technical here, you could\nwe want to get technical here, you could\nwe want to get technical here, you could have written it in a slightly different\nhave written it in a slightly different\nhave written it in a slightly different way and that way is through\nway and that way is through\nway and that way is through this. So remove\nthis. So remove\nthis. So remove this. We could have said system\nthis. We could have said system\nthis. We could have said system prompt. Okay. So what's going on here?\nprompt. Okay. So what's going on here?\nprompt. Okay. So what's going on here? Remember how I said system message is\nRemember how I said system message is\nRemember how I said system message is also something which we imported. Uh so\nalso something which we imported. Uh so\nalso something which we imported. Uh so the system message like I said is this\nthe system message like I said is this\nthe system message like I said is this line of uh is this line. You are my AS\nline of uh is this line. You are my AS\nline of uh is this line. You are my AS system. Please answer my query to the\nsystem. Please answer my query to the\nsystem. Please answer my query to the best of your\nbest of your\nbest of your ability. Now, either way would have\nability. Now, either way would have\nability. Now, either way would have worked if we if I had just straight up\nworked if we if I had just straight up\nworked if we if I had just straight up passed this string into here. That would\npassed this string into here. That would\npassed this string into here. That would have worked as well. Personally, I think\nhave worked as well. Personally, I think\nhave worked as well. Personally, I think this way is better. Even though they\nthis way is better. Even though they\nthis way is better. Even though they achieve the exact same thing, I think\nachieve the exact same thing, I think\nachieve the exact same thing, I think this way is better cuz it's more\nthis way is better cuz it's more\nthis way is better cuz it's more readable. Okay? And you're only adding\nreadable. Okay? And you're only adding\nreadable. Okay? And you're only adding just one more import. Okay? So, I would\njust one more import. Okay? So, I would\njust one more import. Okay? So, I would prefer you to I would really recommend\nprefer you to I would really recommend\nprefer you to I would really recommend you doing like uh like this so even the\nyou doing like uh like this so even the\nyou doing like uh like this so even the large language model knows that this is\nlarge language model knows that this is\nlarge language model knows that this is a system message. Okay, cool. And this\na system message. Okay, cool. And this\na system message. Okay, cool. And this is uh just another way of writing like\nis uh just another way of writing like\nis uh just another way of writing like the updated state. You know how we've\nthe updated state. You know how we've\nthe updated state. You know how we've been writing state uh brackets messages\nbeen writing state uh brackets messages\nbeen writing state uh brackets messages is equal to something something\nis equal to something something\nis equal to something something something. Well, this is a more compact\nsomething. Well, this is a more compact\nsomething. Well, this is a more compact way of updating the state as well. So\nway of updating the state as well. So\nway of updating the state as well. So return messages response. So we update\nreturn messages response. So we update\nreturn messages response. So we update the messages with the response. No plus\nthe messages with the response. No plus\nthe messages with the response. No plus equal to this this this or adding\nequal to this this this or adding\nequal to this this this or adding something we just we can simply just\nsomething we just we can simply just\nsomething we just we can simply just write it with the updated state. Why?\nwrite it with the updated state. Why?\nwrite it with the updated state. Why? because the add messages aka the reducer\nbecause the add messages aka the reducer\nbecause the add messages aka the reducer function handles the appending uh for\nfunction handles the appending uh for\nfunction handles the appending uh for us. It doesn't overwrite it. Now, if I\nus. It doesn't overwrite it. Now, if I\nus. It doesn't overwrite it. Now, if I ran this code and I built the graph and\nran this code and I built the graph and\nran this code and I built the graph and everything, would it\neverything, would it\neverything, would it work? No. Why it wouldn't work? Because\nwork? No. Why it wouldn't work? Because\nwork? No. Why it wouldn't work? Because think about it, the response when we've\nthink about it, the response when we've\nthink about it, the response when we've invoked the model and we store it in the\ninvoked the model and we store it in the\ninvoked the model and we store it in the response when we actually invoked it, we\nresponse when we actually invoked it, we\nresponse when we actually invoked it, we didn't actually pass in the query. How\ndidn't actually pass in the query. How\ndidn't actually pass in the query. How do we pass in the query? Think about it.\ndo we pass in the query? Think about it.\ndo we pass in the query? Think about it. All I passed is my system message. Where\nAll I passed is my system message. Where\nAll I passed is my system message. Where does the query go? So to be able to add\ndoes the query go? So to be able to add\ndoes the query go? So to be able to add the query, I actually have to add like\nthe query, I actually have to add like\nthe query, I actually have to add like this. So state messages. The query it\nthis. So state messages. The query it\nthis. So state messages. The query it will be in the form of a human message.\nwill be in the form of a human message.\nwill be in the form of a human message. And the human message will be stored in\nAnd the human message will be stored in\nAnd the human message will be stored in the messages attribute, right? And now\nthe messages attribute, right? And now\nthe messages attribute, right? And now that we've passed that into our model as\nthat we've passed that into our model as\nthat we've passed that into our model as well and we can invoke it. And now this\nwell and we can invoke it. And now this\nwell and we can invoke it. And now this should work.\nOkay. Okay. Okay, so now we define the\nOkay. Okay. Okay, so now we define the conditional edge. Now why do we need the\nconditional edge. Now why do we need the\nconditional edge. Now why do we need the conditional edge here? I'll put the\nconditional edge here? I'll put the\nconditional edge here? I'll put the picture of the react agent. Again here\npicture of the react agent. Again here\npicture of the react agent. Again here you can see that the looping part even\nyou can see that the looping part even\nyou can see that the looping part even like in the last one in the graph when\nlike in the last one in the graph when\nlike in the last one in the graph when we made the loops for the first time you\nwe made the loops for the first time you\nwe made the loops for the first time you saw that was it was a conditional edge\nsaw that was it was a conditional edge\nsaw that was it was a conditional edge which we had to use and now that's\nwhich we had to use and now that's\nwhich we had to use and now that's actually going to come in play here.\nactually going to come in play here.\nactually going to come in play here. That's why I took so time to build those\nThat's why I took so time to build those\nThat's why I took so time to build those graphs because now the concept is\ngraphs because now the concept is\ngraphs because now the concept is coming. So how do we define the\ncoming. So how do we define the\ncoming. So how do we define the conditional edge def should\ncontinue. Okay. So again like always we\ncontinue. Okay. So again like always we pass in the state and let's do it like\nthis like such else\nthis like such else return continue. Okay. So as you know as\nreturn continue. Okay. So as you know as\nreturn continue. Okay. So as you know as you um might have guessed end and\nyou um might have guessed end and\nyou um might have guessed end and continue will be edges which I'll define\ncontinue will be edges which I'll define\ncontinue will be edges which I'll define later in the graph. But what is going on\nlater in the graph. But what is going on\nlater in the graph. But what is going on here? Well essentially when I'll pass in\nhere? Well essentially when I'll pass in\nhere? Well essentially when I'll pass in the query uh when we've invoked the\nthe query uh when we've invoked the\nthe query uh when we've invoked the actual model you will know that we'll\nactual model you will know that we'll\nactual model you will know that we'll create a list of tools right so what\ncreate a list of tools right so what\ncreate a list of tools right so what we're going to be doing is we're going\nwe're going to be doing is we're going\nwe're going to be doing is we're going to be uh getting the last message and\nto be uh getting the last message and\nto be uh getting the last message and we're going to see if there's any more\nwe're going to see if there's any more\nwe're going to see if there's any more tools needed to be ran. If there are\ntools needed to be ran. If there are\ntools needed to be ran. If there are then we'll go into the continue edge aka\nthen we'll go into the continue edge aka\nthen we'll go into the continue edge aka we'll go to the tool node and we'll\nwe'll go to the tool node and we'll\nwe'll go to the tool node and we'll select the tool and we'll do all this uh\nselect the tool and we'll do all this uh\nselect the tool and we'll do all this uh actions and then come back. If there's\nactions and then come back. If there's\nactions and then come back. If there's no more tool calling left we will just\nno more tool calling left we will just\nno more tool calling left we will just end and we'll just exit the uh graph and\nend and we'll just exit the uh graph and\nend and we'll just exit the uh graph and that'll be the case. You'll get uh uh\nthat'll be the case. You'll get uh uh\nthat'll be the case. You'll get uh uh you'll understand more what I what I\nyou'll understand more what I what I\nyou'll understand more what I what I mean when we've actually test we're\nmean when we've actually test we're\nmean when we've actually test we're testing and running the graph. Okay. Now\ntesting and running the graph. Okay. Now\ntesting and running the graph. Okay. Now let's just define the graph. So like\nlet's just define the graph. So like\nlet's just define the graph. So like always we create the graph we initialize\nalways we create the graph we initialize\nalways we create the graph we initialize the graph through the state graph and\nthe graph through the state graph and\nthe graph through the state graph and let's call the node R agent. So the\nlet's call the node R agent. So the\nlet's call the node R agent. So the action will be the model call aka the\naction will be the model call aka the\naction will be the model call aka the underlying function will be this.\nunderlying function will be this.\nunderlying function will be this. Okay. Now we create something called a\nOkay. Now we create something called a\nOkay. Now we create something called a tool node which is also what we covered\ntool node which is also what we covered\ntool node which is also what we covered in the previous uh in the second section\nin the previous uh in the second section\nin the previous uh in the second section or second chapter in this course. The\nor second chapter in this course. The\nor second chapter in this course. The tool node essentially is just a singular\ntool node essentially is just a singular\ntool node essentially is just a singular node which contains all of the different\nnode which contains all of the different\nnode which contains all of the different tools. So we only have one tool. If you\ntools. So we only have one tool. If you\ntools. So we only have one tool. If you see what this variable is tools, we only\nsee what this variable is tools, we only\nsee what this variable is tools, we only have one tool which is add. Don't worry,\nhave one tool which is add. Don't worry,\nhave one tool which is add. Don't worry, we'll add some more tools like subtracts\nwe'll add some more tools like subtracts\nwe'll add some more tools like subtracts and multiply in a bit. But I just want\nand multiply in a bit. But I just want\nand multiply in a bit. But I just want to uh like really solidify your concept\nto uh like really solidify your concept\nto uh like really solidify your concept of how we can add these tools and how\nof how we can add these tools and how\nof how we can add these tools and how the graph will work. Okay. Now we\nthe graph will work. Okay. Now we\nthe graph will work. Okay. Now we obviously set our entry point and point\nobviously set our entry point and point\nobviously set our entry point and point it to the R\nit to the R\nit to the R agent. Now let's add our conditional\nagent. Now let's add our conditional\nagent. Now let's add our conditional edge. So remember remember how I said\nedge. So remember remember how I said\nedge. So remember remember how I said there's two edges, continue and end.\nthere's two edges, continue and end.\nthere's two edges, continue and end. again continue and end and if it goes to\nagain continue and end and if it goes to\nagain continue and end and if it goes to the end we end it. If it goes to tools\nthe end we end it. If it goes to tools\nthe end we end it. If it goes to tools then we go to tool node which is\nthen we go to tool node which is\nthen we go to tool node which is tools. Okay. Okay. So yeah this is\ntools. Okay. Okay. So yeah this is\ntools. Okay. Okay. So yeah this is pretty straightforward still. Right now\npretty straightforward still. Right now\npretty straightforward still. Right now we also need to add an edge which goes\nwe also need to add an edge which goes\nwe also need to add an edge which goes back from our tool to our agent cuz\nback from our tool to our agent cuz\nback from our tool to our agent cuz that's how we're going to create a\nthat's how we're going to create a\nthat's how we're going to create a circular connection.\ncircular connection.\ncircular connection. Right? You can see that the conditional\nRight? You can see that the conditional\nRight? You can see that the conditional edge only provides a one-way directed\nedge only provides a one-way directed\nedge only provides a one-way directed edge from the from either the agent to\nedge from the from either the agent to\nedge from the from either the agent to the tool node or the agent to the\nthe tool node or the agent to the\nthe tool node or the agent to the endpoint. But we need another edge which\nendpoint. But we need another edge which\nendpoint. But we need another edge which will go back from the uh tool node back\nwill go back from the uh tool node back\nwill go back from the uh tool node back to the agent. And that's what this um\nto the agent. And that's what this um\nto the agent. And that's what this um that's what this edge does. And lastly,\nthat's what this edge does. And lastly,\nthat's what this edge does. And lastly, we need to uh obviously compile it. So\nwe need to uh obviously compile it. So\nwe need to uh obviously compile it. So we'll just say app is equal to graph\nwe'll just say app is equal to graph\nwe'll just say app is equal to graph dompile. Perfect. That's it. Now I've\ndompile. Perfect. That's it. Now I've\ndompile. Perfect. That's it. Now I've just created a a new helper function\njust created a a new helper function\njust created a a new helper function here which this isn't part of langraph.\nhere which this isn't part of langraph.\nhere which this isn't part of langraph. I've just written this code because it\nI've just written this code because it\nI've just written this code because it will make every like the tool calling\nwill make every like the tool calling\nwill make every like the tool calling and everything uh like output in a much\nand everything uh like output in a much\nand everything uh like output in a much better way. So you'll see what I mean in\nbetter way. So you'll see what I mean in\nbetter way. So you'll see what I mean in just one\njust one\njust one second. Okay. So now we\nsecond. Okay. So now we\nsecond. Okay. So now we actually can begin. So let's say the\nactually can begin. So let's say the\nactually can begin. So let's say the input is uh something like this.\ninput is uh something like this.\ninput is uh something like this. Let's say I want to add 3 + 4. Okay,\nLet's say I want to add 3 + 4. Okay,\nLet's say I want to add 3 + 4. Okay, simple. And this line of code basically\nsimple. And this line of code basically\nsimple. And this line of code basically streams the data. That's all it does.\nstreams the data. That's all it does.\nstreams the data. That's all it does. So, let's actually run this. Clear. And\nSo, let's actually run this. Clear. And\nSo, let's actually run this. Clear. And let's do it. Okay. So, remember we wrote\nlet's do it. Okay. So, remember we wrote\nlet's do it. Okay. So, remember we wrote add\nadd\nadd 3+4. Wow, look at that. So, we've added\n3+4. Wow, look at that. So, we've added\n3+4. Wow, look at that. So, we've added 3+4. It calls the tool and it even knows\n3+4. It calls the tool and it even knows\n3+4. It calls the tool and it even knows what tool to pick. Add. Um, and it gives\nwhat tool to pick. Add. Um, and it gives\nwhat tool to pick. Add. Um, and it gives us the result. The tool message as you\nus the result. The tool message as you\nus the result. The tool message as you can see is seven and the AI message the\ncan see is seven and the AI message the\ncan see is seven and the AI message the final AI message is the sum of three and\nfinal AI message is the sum of three and\nfinal AI message is the sum of three and four is seven. That's it. Let's try\nfour is seven. That's it. Let's try\nfour is seven. That's it. Let's try something harder now. Let's write add 34\nsomething harder now. Let's write add 34\nsomething harder now. Let's write add 34 + 21. So if we run\n+ 21. So if we run\n+ 21. So if we run this you can see 55 cuz 34 + 21 is 55.\nthis you can see 55 cuz 34 + 21 is 55.\nthis you can see 55 cuz 34 + 21 is 55. And you can also see again all the tool\nAnd you can also see again all the tool\nAnd you can also see again all the tool calls and everything that's done right.\ncalls and everything that's done right.\ncalls and everything that's done right. I want to show you one two more things\nI want to show you one two more things\nI want to show you one two more things actually before we add some more tools\nactually before we add some more tools\nactually before we add some more tools which is this. If I remove this dock\nwhich is this. If I remove this dock\nwhich is this. If I remove this dock string here by commenting out for\nstring here by commenting out for\nstring here by commenting out for now. Let's clear and let's run that\nnow. Let's clear and let's run that\nnow. Let's clear and let's run that again. Error. Why? Because the function\nagain. Error. Why? Because the function\nagain. Error. Why? Because the function must have a dock string if description\nmust have a dock string if description\nmust have a dock string if description is not provided. The dock string is\nis not provided. The dock string is\nis not provided. The dock string is necessary. That's why included otherwise\nnecessary. That's why included otherwise\nnecessary. That's why included otherwise the graph won't work. It's remember it\nthe graph won't work. It's remember it\nthe graph won't work. It's remember it tells the LM what that tool is for.\ntells the LM what that tool is for.\ntells the LM what that tool is for. Okay. So now that we've have uh we've\nOkay. So now that we've have uh we've\nOkay. So now that we've have uh we've got that there, let's try this as well.\ngot that there, let's try this as well.\ngot that there, let's try this as well. Add\nAdd\nAdd uh 3+ 4. Again, this time I want both of\nuh 3+ 4. Again, this time I want both of\nuh 3+ 4. Again, this time I want both of them to be executed. So\nthem to be executed. So\nthem to be executed. So clear now. Do you think this will work?\nclear now. Do you think this will work?\nclear now. Do you think this will work? Let's\nsee. Add 34 + 21. Add 3+ 4. Perfect.\nsee. Add 34 + 21. Add 3+ 4. Perfect. Brilliant. Okay. So you can see the\nBrilliant. Okay. So you can see the\nBrilliant. Okay. So you can see the result of adding 34 + 21 is 55. The\nresult of adding 34 + 21 is 55. The\nresult of adding 34 + 21 is 55. The result of adding 3+ 4 is 7. You can see\nresult of adding 3+ 4 is 7. You can see\nresult of adding 3+ 4 is 7. You can see how the tool was called twice this time\nhow the tool was called twice this time\nhow the tool was called twice this time and that's the power of the loop which\nand that's the power of the loop which\nand that's the power of the loop which we created. Remember we created the\nwe created. Remember we created the\nwe created. Remember we created the conditional edge and then we also\nconditional edge and then we also\nconditional edge and then we also created that directed edge back from the\ncreated that directed edge back from the\ncreated that directed edge back from the tool node to the agent. Let's let's try\ntool node to the agent. Let's let's try\ntool node to the agent. Let's let's try to make it even uh give more um\nto make it even uh give more um\nto make it even uh give more um complicated stuff. Let's say\ncomplicated stuff. Let's say\ncomplicated stuff. Let's say add add 12 + 12 something. So let me\nadd add 12 + 12 something. So let me\nadd add 12 + 12 something. So let me clear this.\nclear this.\nclear this. Clear. Let's see what happens.\nWow, look at this. If I press enter,\nWow, look at this. If I press enter, sorry, I messed up there. But you can\nsorry, I messed up there. But you can\nsorry, I messed up there. But you can see the results of the addition as well\nsee the results of the addition as well\nsee the results of the addition as well as 34 + 21 is 55 7 24 or and you can\nas 34 + 21 is 55 7 24 or and you can\nas 34 + 21 is 55 7 24 or and you can also see that I called the tool the\nalso see that I called the tool the\nalso see that I called the tool the sorry the AI called the tool three\nsorry the AI called the tool three\nsorry the AI called the tool three times.\ntimes.\ntimes. Now these tool calls is also an\nNow these tool calls is also an\nNow these tool calls is also an indication that the LLM didn't use its\nindication that the LLM didn't use its\nindication that the LLM didn't use its own like information inbuilt information\nown like information inbuilt information\nown like information inbuilt information which it was trained on to come up with\nwhich it was trained on to come up with\nwhich it was trained on to come up with an answer. Right? Remember an LLM\nan answer. Right? Remember an LLM\nan answer. Right? Remember an LLM doesn't know how to do maths. It just\ndoesn't know how to do maths. It just\ndoesn't know how to do maths. It just guesses the next output like through\nguesses the next output like through\nguesses the next output like through probability. But through this we were\nprobability. But through this we were\nprobability. But through this we were able to actually add the two\nable to actually add the two\nable to actually add the two numbers. So an important concept here is\nnumbers. So an important concept here is\nnumbers. So an important concept here is the LLM actually decides what should be\nthe LLM actually decides what should be\nthe LLM actually decides what should be passed as the arguments to each tool. So\npassed as the arguments to each tool. So\npassed as the arguments to each tool. So 3 + 4 like if I said add 3 + 4 it will\n3 + 4 like if I said add 3 + 4 it will\n3 + 4 like if I said add 3 + 4 it will actually uh create it will actually uh\nactually uh create it will actually uh\nactually uh create it will actually uh input the numbers 3 and four and then\ninput the numbers 3 and four and then\ninput the numbers 3 and four and then this tool will handle the uh information\nthis tool will handle the uh information\nthis tool will handle the uh information return it and it will go back to the\nreturn it and it will go back to the\nreturn it and it will go back to the agent and then the AI agent will decide\nagent and then the AI agent will decide\nagent and then the AI agent will decide what's the answer and everything. So\nwhat's the answer and everything. So\nwhat's the answer and everything. So that's how it works. Awesome. Okay. Now\nthat's how it works. Awesome. Okay. Now\nthat's how it works. Awesome. Okay. Now let's make this even more complicated.\nlet's make this even more complicated.\nlet's make this even more complicated. Let's add some more\nLet's add some more\nLet's add some more tools. Let's add\ntools. Let's add\ntools. Let's add subtract and multiply. Okay. And the\nsubtract and multiply. Okay. And the\nsubtract and multiply. Okay. And the only re change we have to do is instead\nonly re change we have to do is instead\nonly re change we have to do is instead of this one line we just now include\nof this one line we just now include\nof this one line we just now include subtract and multiply as well. That's\nsubtract and multiply as well. That's\nsubtract and multiply as well. That's it. Otherwise this line this code\nit. Otherwise this line this code\nit. Otherwise this line this code largely stays the same. Now let's\nlargely stays the same. Now let's\nlargely stays the same. Now let's actually run this same command and see\nactually run this same command and see\nactually run this same command and see if it gets confused with the different\nif it gets confused with the different\nif it gets confused with the different um different tools we have it has access\num different tools we have it has access\num different tools we have it has access to. Now let's see. Okay.\nto. Now let's see. Okay.\nto. Now let's see. Okay. You can see\nYou can see\nYou can see again that 55 724. Okay, it didn't get\nagain that 55 724. Okay, it didn't get\nagain that 55 724. Okay, it didn't get confused. Perfect. Let's now give it a\nconfused. Perfect. Let's now give it a\nconfused. Perfect. Let's now give it a different command. Let's say something\ndifferent command. Let's say something\ndifferent command. Let's say something like this. One\nsecond. Add 40 + 12 and then multiply\nsecond. Add 40 + 12 and then multiply the result by 6. So now it has to make\nthe result by 6. So now it has to make\nthe result by 6. So now it has to make use of two different tools. Let's see if\nuse of two different tools. Let's see if\nuse of two different tools. Let's see if it gets\nit gets\nit gets that.\nthat.\nthat. Okay. Wow. Brilliant. So it first used\nOkay. Wow. Brilliant. So it first used\nOkay. Wow. Brilliant. So it first used the add tool and then used the\nthe add tool and then used the\nthe add tool and then used the multiplication tool and you can see all\nmultiplication tool and you can see all\nmultiplication tool and you can see all the queries or all the tool called and\nthe queries or all the tool called and\nthe queries or all the tool called and everything and the final answer is 312.\neverything and the final answer is 312.\neverything and the final answer is 312. So 52 * 6 yes it is 312. Okay. Wow that\nSo 52 * 6 yes it is 312. Okay. Wow that\nSo 52 * 6 yes it is 312. Okay. Wow that works like brilliantly. So now that we\nworks like brilliantly. So now that we\nworks like brilliantly. So now that we know that this is robust what about if I\nknow that this is robust what about if I\nknow that this is robust what about if I add this let's say also tell me a joke\nadd this let's say also tell me a joke\nadd this let's say also tell me a joke please. What do you think will happen?\nplease. What do you think will happen?\nplease. What do you think will happen? Do you think this will break? Let's see.\nDo you think this will break? Let's see.\nDo you think this will break? Let's see. If I play this and run this. Let's\nsee. Wow. Look at\nsee. Wow. Look at this. The result of 40 adding 14 and 12\nthis. The result of 40 adding 14 and 12\nthis. The result of 40 adding 14 and 12 is 52 multiplying that is by 6 is 312.\nis 52 multiplying that is by 6 is 312.\nis 52 multiplying that is by 6 is 312. And here's a joke for you. Why don't\nAnd here's a joke for you. Why don't\nAnd here's a joke for you. Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't\nskeletons fight each other? They don't\nskeletons fight each other? They don't have the gun. I swear to God, it's\nhave the gun. I swear to God, it's\nhave the gun. I swear to God, it's always the same dead joke. But you get\nalways the same dead joke. But you get\nalways the same dead joke. But you get the point. This is so robust. It can\nthe point. This is so robust. It can\nthe point. This is so robust. It can handle even queries where it doesn't\nhandle even queries where it doesn't\nhandle even queries where it doesn't even need a tool and that ladies and\neven need a tool and that ladies and\neven need a tool and that ladies and gentlemen is the power of langraph. So\ngentlemen is the power of langraph. So\ngentlemen is the power of langraph. So it's it's so robust even if we don't\nit's it's so robust even if we don't\nit's it's so robust even if we don't need to use a tool it will still give us\nneed to use a tool it will still give us\nneed to use a tool it will still give us an answer and the reason it was able to\nan answer and the reason it was able to\nan answer and the reason it was able to do that is once all the tool calling is\ndo that is once all the tool calling is\ndo that is once all the tool calling is done it passes it to the agent the agent\ndone it passes it to the agent the agent\ndone it passes it to the agent the agent checks again oh I need to tell it I need\nchecks again oh I need to tell it I need\nchecks again oh I need to tell it I need to tell the user a joke as well and adds\nto tell the user a joke as well and adds\nto tell the user a joke as well and adds that to the final information and then\nthat to the final information and then\nthat to the final information and then ends it that's the power of\nends it that's the power of\nends it that's the power of lang okay so after all of that we\nlang okay so after all of that we\nlang okay so after all of that we finally now know how to create a react\nfinally now know how to create a react\nfinally now know how to create a react agent yes it was a simple react agent\nagent yes it was a simple react agent\nagent yes it was a simple react agent but the concepts the same. You can\nbut the concepts the same. You can\nbut the concepts the same. You can create your own external tools from now\ncreate your own external tools from now\ncreate your own external tools from now onwards and you can create your own\nonwards and you can create your own\nonwards and you can create your own graph. And that was the whole point of\ngraph. And that was the whole point of\ngraph. And that was the whole point of this course, right? For you to actually\nthis course, right? For you to actually\nthis course, right? For you to actually understand how we can uh create these um\nunderstand how we can uh create these um\nunderstand how we can uh create these um how we can use different tools and then\nhow we can use different tools and then\nhow we can use different tools and then the rest is up to you. It's up to your\nthe rest is up to you. It's up to your\nthe rest is up to you. It's up to your imagination. Okay, perfect. So now I\nimagination. Okay, perfect. So now I\nimagination. Okay, perfect. So now I will see you at the next subsection. All\nwill see you at the next subsection. All\nwill see you at the next subsection. All right, see you there. Okay, people. So\nright, see you there. Okay, people. So\nright, see you there. Okay, people. So we've made great progress so far. So\nwe've made great progress so far. So\nwe've made great progress so far. So well done on that. But now we make a\nwell done on that. But now we make a\nwell done on that. But now we make a fourth AI agent. And this time we'll do\nfourth AI agent. And this time we'll do\nfourth AI agent. And this time we'll do things again slightly differently. Well,\nthings again slightly differently. Well,\nthings again slightly differently. Well, this time we're going to be making a\nthis time we're going to be making a\nthis time we're going to be making a mini project together. So the project's\nmini project together. So the project's\nmini project together. So the project's name is going to be called Drafter. And\nname is going to be called Drafter. And\nname is going to be called Drafter. And you'll see why in a minute. So picture\nyou'll see why in a minute. So picture\nyou'll see why in a minute. So picture this. Me and you are working in a\nthis. Me and you are working in a\nthis. Me and you are working in a company together. And our boss comes up\ncompany together. And our boss comes up\ncompany together. And our boss comes up to us and she has a problem and some\nto us and she has a problem and some\nto us and she has a problem and some orders for us. So the problem is this.\norders for us. So the problem is this.\norders for us. So the problem is this. Our company is not working efficiently.\nOur company is not working efficiently.\nOur company is not working efficiently. We spend way too much time drafting\nWe spend way too much time drafting\nWe spend way too much time drafting documents and this needs to be fixed.\ndocuments and this needs to be fixed.\ndocuments and this needs to be fixed. Again, a valid problem. So, what are her\nAgain, a valid problem. So, what are her\nAgain, a valid problem. So, what are her orders? She says you need to create an\norders? She says you need to create an\norders? She says you need to create an AI agentic system that can speed up\nAI agentic system that can speed up\nAI agentic system that can speed up drafting documents, emails, etc. The AI\ndrafting documents, emails, etc. The AI\ndrafting documents, emails, etc. The AI agentic system should have human AI\nagentic system should have human AI\nagentic system should have human AI collaboration, meaning the human should\ncollaboration, meaning the human should\ncollaboration, meaning the human should be able to provide continuous feedback\nbe able to provide continuous feedback\nbe able to provide continuous feedback and the AI agent should stop when the\nand the AI agent should stop when the\nand the AI agent should stop when the human is happy with the draft.\nhuman is happy with the draft.\nhuman is happy with the draft. The system should also be fast and be\nThe system should also be fast and be\nThe system should also be fast and be able to save the drafts. Okay. So then\nable to save the drafts. Okay. So then\nable to save the drafts. Okay. So then me and you start discussing and we are\nme and you start discussing and we are\nme and you start discussing and we are going to use land graph obviously and we\ngoing to use land graph obviously and we\ngoing to use land graph obviously and we come up with a sketch. Now the sketch of\ncome up with a sketch. Now the sketch of\ncome up with a sketch. Now the sketch of our graph is something like this. It\nour graph is something like this. It\nour graph is something like this. It obviously is going to have a start and\nobviously is going to have a start and\nobviously is going to have a start and an end point and it's going to have our\nan end point and it's going to have our\nan end point and it's going to have our agent and the agent will have access to\nagent and the agent will have access to\nagent and the agent will have access to tools aka the tool node. Now this looks\ntools aka the tool node. Now this looks\ntools aka the tool node. Now this looks similar to a react agent which we\nsimilar to a react agent which we\nsimilar to a react agent which we covered in the last subsection. But\ncovered in the last subsection. But\ncovered in the last subsection. But there's a reason we don't we haven't\nthere's a reason we don't we haven't\nthere's a reason we don't we haven't chosen to do that. See we realize that\nchosen to do that. See we realize that\nchosen to do that. See we realize that one of the tools is the save tool. It\none of the tools is the save tool. It\none of the tools is the save tool. It will save the draft, right? That was one\nwill save the draft, right? That was one\nwill save the draft, right? That was one of our requirements. But obviously when\nof our requirements. But obviously when\nof our requirements. But obviously when we once we've saved it, the process\nwe once we've saved it, the process\nwe once we've saved it, the process should end, right? But if you remember\nshould end, right? But if you remember\nshould end, right? But if you remember from a React agent, the tools always\nfrom a React agent, the tools always\nfrom a React agent, the tools always goes back to the AI agent, not directly\ngoes back to the AI agent, not directly\ngoes back to the AI agent, not directly to the endpoint. And we don't want that\nto the endpoint. And we don't want that\nto the endpoint. And we don't want that anymore. So that's why as soon as the\nanymore. So that's why as soon as the\nanymore. So that's why as soon as the save tool is used because the save tool\nsave tool is used because the save tool\nsave tool is used because the save tool will be within tools right it ends. So\nwill be within tools right it ends. So\nwill be within tools right it ends. So that is the structure we have chosen to\nthat is the structure we have chosen to\nthat is the structure we have chosen to go with. So the only thing left is to\ngo with. So the only thing left is to\ngo with. So the only thing left is to actually code this graph. So let's code\nactually code this graph. So let's code\nactually code this graph. So let's code this together\nthis together\nthis together then. Okay. So let's actually code up\nthen. Okay. So let's actually code up\nthen. Okay. So let's actually code up this drafter project then. So you can\nthis drafter project then. So you can\nthis drafter project then. So you can see I've already done all the imports\nsee I've already done all the imports\nsee I've already done all the imports and I've loaded up my env file. Now all\nand I've loaded up my env file. Now all\nand I've loaded up my env file. Now all of these imports are imports which\nof these imports are imports which\nof these imports are imports which you've already uh encountered before. So\nyou've already uh encountered before. So\nyou've already uh encountered before. So there's no point in looking at them\nthere's no point in looking at them\nthere's no point in looking at them again. But the first thing which I'm\nagain. But the first thing which I'm\nagain. But the first thing which I'm going to do is I'm going to be defining\ngoing to do is I'm going to be defining\ngoing to do is I'm going to be defining the a global variable.\nthe a global variable.\nthe a global variable. Now this global variable yes it's a bit\nNow this global variable yes it's a bit\nNow this global variable yes it's a bit odd defining global variables and\nodd defining global variables and\nodd defining global variables and there's a reason which I've done it and\nthere's a reason which I've done it and\nthere's a reason which I've done it and this will become more apparent as I go\nthis will become more apparent as I go\nthis will become more apparent as I go through the code but just as a heads up\nthrough the code but just as a heads up\nthrough the code but just as a heads up the reason I've defined a global\nthe reason I've defined a global\nthe reason I've defined a global variable in this case is to actually\nvariable in this case is to actually\nvariable in this case is to actually pass in a state in tools the the correct\npass in a state in tools the the correct\npass in a state in tools the the correct way to do it in langraph is through\nway to do it in langraph is through\nway to do it in langraph is through something called injected state now\nsomething called injected state now\nsomething called injected state now injected state is beyond the scope of\ninjected state is beyond the scope of\ninjected state is beyond the scope of this uh course so the workound on that\nthis uh course so the workound on that\nthis uh course so the workound on that is to use a global variable and what\nis to use a global variable and what\nis to use a global variable and what will happen is our tools will uh\nwill happen is our tools will uh\nwill happen is our tools will uh whatever updates are made uh we'll\nwhatever updates are made uh we'll\nwhatever updates are made uh we'll update the global variable and then when\nupdate the global variable and then when\nupdate the global variable and then when we go on to save it uh the save tool\nwe go on to save it uh the save tool\nwe go on to save it uh the save tool will use the contents in this global\nwill use the contents in this global\nwill use the contents in this global variable and save that into a text file.\nvariable and save that into a text file.\nvariable and save that into a text file. So that's why this is included. Okay. So\nSo that's why this is included. Okay. So\nSo that's why this is included. Okay. So now let's define our agent state again.\nnow let's define our agent state again.\nnow let's define our agent state again. And the way that's done is the exact\nAnd the way that's done is the exact\nAnd the way that's done is the exact same way we did last time. Uh class\nsame way we did last time. Uh class\nsame way we did last time. Uh class agent state messages annotated sequence\nagent state messages annotated sequence\nagent state messages annotated sequence base message add message as the reducer\nbase message add message as the reducer\nbase message add message as the reducer function. So now we define the tools and\nfunction. So now we define the tools and\nfunction. So now we define the tools and there will be two tools for this. The\nthere will be two tools for this. The\nthere will be two tools for this. The first tool will be the update tool and\nfirst tool will be the update tool and\nfirst tool will be the update tool and the second tool will be the save tool.\nthe second tool will be the save tool.\nthe second tool will be the save tool. So let's start off with the uh update\nSo let's start off with the uh update\nSo let's start off with the uh update tool and I will obviously use the\ntool and I will obviously use the\ntool and I will obviously use the decorator and then create def\ndecorator and then create def\ndecorator and then create def update and then we need to pass in\nuh pass in a parameter content. Now just\nuh pass in a parameter content. Now just as a refresher whatever parameters you\nas a refresher whatever parameters you\nas a refresher whatever parameters you pass or you request who actually gets\npass or you request who actually gets\npass or you request who actually gets those parameters? Well, the LLM or your\nthose parameters? Well, the LLM or your\nthose parameters? Well, the LLM or your model in the background that's uh what\nmodel in the background that's uh what\nmodel in the background that's uh what will automatically pass the parameters\nwill automatically pass the parameters\nwill automatically pass the parameters for this model uh for this tool. So, uh\nfor this model uh for this tool. So, uh\nfor this model uh for this tool. So, uh in this case the content parameter will\nin this case the content parameter will\nin this case the content parameter will be uh that will be provided by the lm in\nbe uh that will be provided by the lm in\nbe uh that will be provided by the lm in the background. So, you don't need to\nthe background. So, you don't need to\nthe background. So, you don't need to worry about that. Okay. So, now we need\nworry about that. Okay. So, now we need\nworry about that. Okay. So, now we need the dock string obviously and I've just\nthe dock string obviously and I've just\nthe dock string obviously and I've just created a simple dock string which just\ncreated a simple dock string which just\ncreated a simple dock string which just updates the document with the provided\nupdates the document with the provided\nupdates the document with the provided content because that is exactly what it\ncontent because that is exactly what it\ncontent because that is exactly what it does.\ndoes.\ndoes. So now we define to interact with the\nSo now we define to interact with the\nSo now we define to interact with the global variable in Python, you obviously\nglobal variable in Python, you obviously\nglobal variable in Python, you obviously need to uh define it uh you need to code\nneed to uh define it uh you need to code\nneed to uh define it uh you need to code it like this and then you need to update\nit like this and then you need to update\nit like this and then you need to update your document content aka the global\nyour document content aka the global\nyour document content aka the global variable with your current content and\nvariable with your current content and\nvariable with your current content and then you just return again a statement\nthen you just return again a statement\nthen you just return again a statement to the like the large language model\nto the like the large language model\nto the like the large language model telling it that we have successfully\ntelling it that we have successfully\ntelling it that we have successfully updated it. So I've written document has\nupdated it. So I've written document has\nupdated it. So I've written document has been updated successfully. The current\nbeen updated successfully. The current\nbeen updated successfully. The current content is this which is the content\ncontent is this which is the content\ncontent is this which is the content which we store in the thing. Okay. So\nwhich we store in the thing. Okay. So\nwhich we store in the thing. Okay. So now we define our second tool which is\nnow we define our second tool which is\nnow we define our second tool which is the save tool. So again same decorator\nthe save tool. So again same decorator\nthe save tool. So again same decorator we use uh like\nwe use uh like\nwe use uh like this. And now we request the llm to give\nthis. And now we request the llm to give\nthis. And now we request the llm to give us a file name as well. So it will it\nus a file name as well. So it will it\nus a file name as well. So it will it should give us a suitable file name uh\nshould give us a suitable file name uh\nshould give us a suitable file name uh which will be a suitable file name for\nwhich will be a suitable file name for\nwhich will be a suitable file name for the text file and uh it will and now\nthe text file and uh it will and now\nthe text file and uh it will and now this save tool will automatically handle\nthis save tool will automatically handle\nthis save tool will automatically handle all the save logic. So uh as a dock\nall the save logic. So uh as a dock\nall the save logic. So uh as a dock string I pass like this. So saves the\nstring I pass like this. So saves the\nstring I pass like this. So saves the current document to a text file and\ncurrent document to a text file and\ncurrent document to a text file and finishes the process. And the arguments\nfinishes the process. And the arguments\nfinishes the process. And the arguments are file name which is the name for the\nare file name which is the name for the\nare file name which is the name for the text file. Now, I've specifically\ntext file. Now, I've specifically\ntext file. Now, I've specifically mentioned that we're going to be using a\nmentioned that we're going to be using a\nmentioned that we're going to be using a text file so that the uh uh the LLM\ntext file so that the uh uh the LLM\ntext file so that the uh uh the LLM knows that the file name which it needs\nknows that the file name which it needs\nknows that the file name which it needs to pass has to have a txt in the end of\nto pass has to have a txt in the end of\nto pass has to have a txt in the end of it. Now, if it doesn't uh by any means\nit. Now, if it doesn't uh by any means\nit. Now, if it doesn't uh by any means to make the uh graph to make the entire\nto make the uh graph to make the entire\nto make the uh graph to make the entire code more robust, I've also written this\ncode more robust, I've also written this\ncode more robust, I've also written this if statement such that if this file name\nif statement such that if this file name\nif statement such that if this file name doesn't end with a txt, just put a txt\ndoesn't end with a txt, just put a txt\ndoesn't end with a txt, just put a txt there just uh as robust as measure. Now\nthere just uh as robust as measure. Now\nthere just uh as robust as measure. Now again we need to uh call the global\nagain we need to uh call the global\nagain we need to uh call the global variable again. So global document\nvariable again. So global document\nvariable again. So global document content. Okay. Now this next bit of code\ncontent. Okay. Now this next bit of code\ncontent. Okay. Now this next bit of code that's this is not langraph. This is\nthat's this is not langraph. This is\nthat's this is not langraph. This is just uh whatever you put in the tool. Uh\njust uh whatever you put in the tool. Uh\njust uh whatever you put in the tool. Uh it it doesn't have to it's not going to\nit it doesn't have to it's not going to\nit it doesn't have to it's not going to be langraph related. Right. So this\nbe langraph related. Right. So this\nbe langraph related. Right. So this piece of code is just uh some code which\npiece of code is just uh some code which\npiece of code is just uh some code which allows you to save the uh contents a the\nallows you to save the uh contents a the\nallows you to save the uh contents a the the content store in in the global\nthe content store in in the global\nthe content store in in the global variable under the file name uh and as a\nvariable under the file name uh and as a\nvariable under the file name uh and as a text file and I've also added this\ntext file and I've also added this\ntext file and I've also added this exception uh which is a good thing for\nexception uh which is a good thing for\nexception uh which is a good thing for debugging purposes where it if there's\ndebugging purposes where it if there's\ndebugging purposes where it if there's an error it will tell me exactly what\nan error it will tell me exactly what\nan error it will tell me exactly what the error is and then we can fix it.\nthe error is and then we can fix it.\nthe error is and then we can fix it. Okay. So hopefully there won't be any\nOkay. So hopefully there won't be any\nOkay. So hopefully there won't be any errors. Now we create a list of tools\nerrors. Now we create a list of tools\nerrors. Now we create a list of tools which uh again will be update and save\nwhich uh again will be update and save\nwhich uh again will be update and save because we only have two tools. And now\nbecause we only have two tools. And now\nbecause we only have two tools. And now we actually call the uh model and how do\nwe actually call the uh model and how do\nwe actually call the uh model and how do we call the model like\nwe call the model like\nwe call the model like such? Now let me ask you a question. Is\nsuch? Now let me ask you a question. Is\nsuch? Now let me ask you a question. Is this it for the model definition or do\nthis it for the model definition or do\nthis it for the model definition or do we need something\nwe need something\nwe need something else? Well, there's a reason I asked\nelse? Well, there's a reason I asked\nelse? Well, there's a reason I asked that question, right? We forgotten to do\nthat question, right? We forgotten to do\nthat question, right? We forgotten to do bind tools. So bind tools and tools. So\nbind tools. So bind tools and tools. So\nbind tools. So bind tools and tools. So that will do. Okay. Now we actually\nthat will do. Okay. Now we actually\nthat will do. Okay. Now we actually initialize the agent itself or the\ninitialize the agent itself or the\ninitialize the agent itself or the function which will cuz remember the\nfunction which will cuz remember the\nfunction which will cuz remember the agent will be a node in our graph. And\nagent will be a node in our graph. And\nagent will be a node in our graph. And what will be the function behind that?\nwhat will be the function behind that?\nwhat will be the function behind that? It will be this function which we're\nIt will be this function which we're\nIt will be this function which we're about to define. So let's write this as\nabout to define. So let's write this as\nabout to define. So let's write this as def r agent. And again we need to pass\ndef r agent. And again we need to pass\ndef r agent. And again we need to pass in the state the agent state and it'll\nin the state the agent state and it'll\nin the state the agent state and it'll return the agent state.\nreturn the agent state.\nreturn the agent state. And okay so now this doc uh not doc\nAnd okay so now this doc uh not doc\nAnd okay so now this doc uh not doc string this we need to pass in a system\nstring this we need to pass in a system\nstring this we need to pass in a system message to our llm right now this llm\nmessage to our llm right now this llm\nmessage to our llm right now this llm this system prompt will be quite large\nthis system prompt will be quite large\nthis system prompt will be quite large so get ready\nso get ready\nso get ready uh like such so in this system prompt I\nuh like such so in this system prompt I\nuh like such so in this system prompt I have specifically said this is a system\nhave specifically said this is a system\nhave specifically said this is a system message and the content is this you are\nmessage and the content is this you are\nmessage and the content is this you are drafter a helpful writing assistant\ndrafter a helpful writing assistant\ndrafter a helpful writing assistant you're going to help the user aka us to\nyou're going to help the user aka us to\nyou're going to help the user aka us to update and modify documents and I've\nupdate and modify documents and I've\nupdate and modify documents and I've also written some more stuff about what\nalso written some more stuff about what\nalso written some more stuff about what the uh update or what what to do if the\nthe uh update or what what to do if the\nthe uh update or what what to do if the user wants to update. We use the update\nuser wants to update. We use the update\nuser wants to update. We use the update tool. Uh we need to use the save tool to\ntool. Uh we need to use the save tool to\ntool. Uh we need to use the save tool to save it and to always show the current\nsave it and to always show the current\nsave it and to always show the current document say after modifications and all\ndocument say after modifications and all\ndocument say after modifications and all that stuff. Cool.\nthat stuff. Cool.\nthat stuff. Cool. Okay. So, oops. There we go.\nOkay. So, oops. There we go.\nOkay. So, oops. There we go. And now it's time for some robustness\nAnd now it's time for some robustness\nAnd now it's time for some robustness measures. So when we're first\nmeasures. So when we're first\nmeasures. So when we're first initializing the graph like when it's\ninitializing the graph like when it's\ninitializing the graph like when it's the first message we're writing\nthe first message we're writing\nthe first message we're writing obviously we're not going to straight up\nobviously we're not going to straight up\nobviously we're not going to straight up say uh how would you like to change the\nsay uh how would you like to change the\nsay uh how would you like to change the document right because we haven't passed\ndocument right because we haven't passed\ndocument right because we haven't passed in a document yet. So if messages uh\nin a document yet. So if messages uh\nin a document yet. So if messages uh this part if that if there's nothing in\nthis part if that if there's nothing in\nthis part if that if there's nothing in it we will have to say something like an\nit we will have to say something like an\nit we will have to say something like an introduction message right. So this is\nintroduction message right. So this is\nintroduction message right. So this is how you can do that. So we can\nsay if not state messages aka if there's\nsay if not state messages aka if there's nothing in the state messages then we\nnothing in the state messages then we\nnothing in the state messages then we can say uh I'm ready to help you update\ncan say uh I'm ready to help you update\ncan say uh I'm ready to help you update a document. What would you like to\na document. What would you like to\na document. What would you like to create? and then it collects the user\ncreate? and then it collects the user\ncreate? and then it collects the user input and passes it as a put stores it\ninput and passes it as a put stores it\ninput and passes it as a put stores it as a a human message in this user\nas a a human message in this user\nas a a human message in this user message variable. Now what if I've\nmessage variable. Now what if I've\nmessage variable. Now what if I've already passed it uh passed in a message\nalready passed it uh passed in a message\nalready passed it uh passed in a message or like we are on the process of\nor like we are on the process of\nor like we are on the process of updating our draft or drafting it. Well\nupdating our draft or drafting it. Well\nupdating our draft or drafting it. Well to do that we need this else statement\nto do that we need this else statement\nto do that we need this else statement and what does this say? Well it says\nand what does this say? Well it says\nand what does this say? Well it says what would you like to do with the\nwhat would you like to do with the\nwhat would you like to do with the document? So this assume this says that\ndocument? So this assume this says that\ndocument? So this assume this says that there's already stuff in the messages uh\nthere's already stuff in the messages uh\nthere's already stuff in the messages uh state a messages key in the state how do\nstate a messages key in the state how do\nstate a messages key in the state how do you want to update it further and then\nyou want to update it further and then\nyou want to update it further and then we also print it uh under this emoji uh\nwe also print it uh under this emoji uh\nwe also print it uh under this emoji uh in the terminal so the user can also see\nin the terminal so the user can also see\nin the terminal so the user can also see what they've inputed and then this is\nwhat they've inputed and then this is\nwhat they've inputed and then this is also stored in the user message. All\nalso stored in the user message. All\nalso stored in the user message. All right. Okay.\nright. Okay.\nright. Okay. Now we combine all of this uh all\nNow we combine all of this uh all\nNow we combine all of this uh all messages aka the system prompt which was\nmessages aka the system prompt which was\nmessages aka the system prompt which was the system message uh and we create a\nthe system message uh and we create a\nthe system message uh and we create a list of uh list of the uh state messages\nlist of uh list of the uh state messages\nlist of uh list of the uh state messages and the user message the new message\nand the user message the new message\nand the user message the new message which we want the aka the update and\nwhich we want the aka the update and\nwhich we want the aka the update and then we just invoke the model and how do\nthen we just invoke the model and how do\nthen we just invoke the model and how do we invoke the model you just use the uh\nwe invoke the model you just use the uh\nwe invoke the model you just use the uh model invoke okay so pretty basic code\nmodel invoke okay so pretty basic code\nmodel invoke okay so pretty basic code so far there's nothing hard or nothing\nso far there's nothing hard or nothing\nso far there's nothing hard or nothing uh extraordinary or something we haven't\nuh extraordinary or something we haven't\nuh extraordinary or something we haven't seen before. All of this we have seen\nseen before. All of this we have seen\nseen before. All of this we have seen before. And now the rest of this\nbefore. And now the rest of this\nbefore. And now the rest of this function is just a print statement which\nfunction is just a print statement which\nfunction is just a print statement which I've included. This print statement is\nI've included. This print statement is\nI've included. This print statement is just for uh um making things look\njust for uh um making things look\njust for uh um making things look prettier on the terminal. That's all it\nprettier on the terminal. That's all it\nprettier on the terminal. That's all it is. You can see the true print\nis. You can see the true print\nis. You can see the true print statements. There's the AI response\nstatements. There's the AI response\nstatements. There's the AI response which will be printed and then there'll\nwhich will be printed and then there'll\nwhich will be printed and then there'll be the tools uh whatever the tool\nbe the tools uh whatever the tool\nbe the tools uh whatever the tool messages are that's also printed. So\nmessages are that's also printed. So\nmessages are that's also printed. So that's the whole point of it. there's\nthat's the whole point of it. there's\nthat's the whole point of it. there's nothing like to really like talk about\nnothing like to really like talk about\nnothing like to really like talk about it here. Uh and then we also need to\nit here. Uh and then we also need to\nit here. Uh and then we also need to obviously\nobviously\nobviously return the updated state. Now remember\nreturn the updated state. Now remember\nreturn the updated state. Now remember last time I showed you that this is also\nlast time I showed you that this is also\nlast time I showed you that this is also a really convenient concise way to uh\na really convenient concise way to uh\na really convenient concise way to uh update the states. So from now onwards\nupdate the states. So from now onwards\nupdate the states. So from now onwards we're only going to update the states\nwe're only going to update the states\nwe're only going to update the states like this. Okay. Now we create our\nlike this. Okay. Now we create our\nlike this. Okay. Now we create our conditional edge function or the\nconditional edge function or the\nconditional edge function or the function behind the conditional edge cuz\nfunction behind the conditional edge cuz\nfunction behind the conditional edge cuz remember let me open this up. So the\nremember let me open this up. So the\nremember let me open this up. So the conditional edge which I'm talking about\nconditional edge which I'm talking about\nconditional edge which I'm talking about will be this this this conditional edge.\nwill be this this this conditional edge.\nwill be this this this conditional edge. So there from tools there will be either\nSo there from tools there will be either\nSo there from tools there will be either the select the uh the choice of going to\nthe select the uh the choice of going to\nthe select the uh the choice of going to back to the agent or the choice of\nback to the agent or the choice of\nback to the agent or the choice of ending it. So we need to create the\nending it. So we need to create the\nending it. So we need to create the underlying function behind that. So\nunderlying function behind that. So\nunderlying function behind that. So let's create that now\nlet's create that now\nlet's create that now uh under this. So should continue. We've\nuh under this. So should continue. We've\nuh under this. So should continue. We've done this many times before. it det will\ndone this many times before. it det will\ndone this many times before. it det will determine if we should continue or end\ndetermine if we should continue or end\ndetermine if we should continue or end the conversation and remember continue\nthe conversation and remember continue\nthe conversation and remember continue or end the conversation. Okay, makes\nor end the conversation. Okay, makes\nor end the conversation. Okay, makes total\ntotal\ntotal sense. Okay, so\nnow we do this. So we get the messages\nnow we do this. So we get the messages and if there's nothing in the messages,\nand if there's nothing in the messages,\nand if there's nothing in the messages, well obviously we'll need to continue,\nwell obviously we'll need to continue,\nwell obviously we'll need to continue, right? It won't go to the end part. Uh\nright? It won't go to the end part. Uh\nright? It won't go to the end part. Uh and this is just as like a robustness\nand this is just as like a robustness\nand this is just as like a robustness measure to be honest.\nmeasure to be honest.\nmeasure to be honest. Okay. So now this piece of code\nOkay. So now this piece of code\nOkay. So now this piece of code is basically saying look at the most\nis basically saying look at the most\nis basically saying look at the most recent tool message or the uh recent\nrecent tool message or the uh recent\nrecent tool message or the uh recent tool we've used and we need to check if\ntool we've used and we need to check if\ntool we've used and we need to check if this tool uh has used the save tool. Now\nthis tool uh has used the save tool. Now\nthis tool uh has used the save tool. Now why remember how we have two tools we\nwhy remember how we have two tools we\nwhy remember how we have two tools we have either the uh update tool or the\nhave either the uh update tool or the\nhave either the uh update tool or the save tool. If we use the update tool,\nsave tool. If we use the update tool,\nsave tool. If we use the update tool, well, we will obviously need to use the\nwell, we will obviously need to use the\nwell, we will obviously need to use the continue branch, right? But if we use\ncontinue branch, right? But if we use\ncontinue branch, right? But if we use the uh save tool, well, after you saved\nthe uh save tool, well, after you saved\nthe uh save tool, well, after you saved it, there's nothing else to do, right?\nit, there's nothing else to do, right?\nit, there's nothing else to do, right? You finished your draft, you finished\nYou finished your draft, you finished\nYou finished your draft, you finished everything, so might as well end the\neverything, so might as well end the\neverything, so might as well end the program. That's why this end tool. So,\nprogram. That's why this end tool. So,\nprogram. That's why this end tool. So, for the continue, uh if to go to the\nfor the continue, uh if to go to the\nfor the continue, uh if to go to the continue um through the continue edge,\ncontinue um through the continue edge,\ncontinue um through the continue edge, we have to use the update tool. And to\nwe have to use the update tool. And to\nwe have to use the update tool. And to go to the end uh edge you need to use\ngo to the end uh edge you need to use\ngo to the end uh edge you need to use the uh the save tool. So should make\nthe uh the save tool. So should make\nthe uh the save tool. So should make sense now but don't worry if it doesn't\nsense now but don't worry if it doesn't\nsense now but don't worry if it doesn't we will do some more print statements so\nwe will do some more print statements so\nwe will do some more print statements so you see the workflow. Don't worry. And\nyou see the workflow. Don't worry. And\nyou see the workflow. Don't worry. And lastly we need to obviously return\nlastly we need to obviously return\nlastly we need to obviously return continue because by\ncontinue because by\ncontinue because by default it's checked here that it's used\ndefault it's checked here that it's used\ndefault it's checked here that it's used the save tool. The only other tool left\nthe save tool. The only other tool left\nthe save tool. The only other tool left is the right tool and uh sorry the\nis the right tool and uh sorry the\nis the right tool and uh sorry the update tool. And the update tool means\nupdate tool. And the update tool means\nupdate tool. And the update tool means that we have to go to the continue edge,\nthat we have to go to the continue edge,\nthat we have to go to the continue edge, right? Okay. And that's that uh function\nright? Okay. And that's that uh function\nright? Okay. And that's that uh function done as well. So pretty easy still. Now\ndone as well. So pretty easy still. Now\ndone as well. So pretty easy still. Now this next function is again I only coded\nthis next function is again I only coded\nthis next function is again I only coded this just to make the print statements\nthis just to make the print statements\nthis just to make the print statements in a more readable message format uh\nin a more readable message format uh\nin a more readable message format uh when we printed on the terminal. So you\nwhen we printed on the terminal. So you\nwhen we printed on the terminal. So you will see where this comes in play when\nwill see where this comes in play when\nwill see where this comes in play when we actually start uh invoking the graph\nwe actually start uh invoking the graph\nwe actually start uh invoking the graph and seeing how our process is going.\nand seeing how our process is going.\nand seeing how our process is going. Okay, cool. Okay. So now we actually\nOkay, cool. Okay. So now we actually\nOkay, cool. Okay. So now we actually init uh create the graph. So how do we\ninit uh create the graph. So how do we\ninit uh create the graph. So how do we create the graph? We've done this many\ncreate the graph? We've done this many\ncreate the graph? We've done this many times. We will initialize it through a\ntimes. We will initialize it through a\ntimes. We will initialize it through a state graph. And now we will add the\nstate graph. And now we will add the\nstate graph. And now we will add the nodes. So agent and tools. And the tools\nnodes. So agent and tools. And the tools\nnodes. So agent and tools. And the tools will be a tool node. And again if you\nwill be a tool node. And again if you\nwill be a tool node. And again if you notice back we had one node, two node,\nnotice back we had one node, two node,\nnotice back we had one node, two node, the agent node and the tools node.\nthe agent node and the tools node.\nthe agent node and the tools node. I'm keep I'm like reflecting back and\nI'm keep I'm like reflecting back and\nI'm keep I'm like reflecting back and forth between this diagram and the code\nforth between this diagram and the code\nforth between this diagram and the code so I can show you exactly what we're\nso I can show you exactly what we're\nso I can show you exactly what we're coding. Okay. So again agent and tools\ncoding. Okay. So again agent and tools\ncoding. Okay. So again agent and tools node uh we've\nnode uh we've\nnode uh we've done now we will set the entry point at\ndone now we will set the entry point at\ndone now we will set the entry point at agent which is the start point aka this\nagent which is the start point aka this\nagent which is the start point aka this part\npart\npart right and now we're going to add an edge\nright and now we're going to add an edge\nright and now we're going to add an edge between agent and tools. Now we need to\nbetween agent and tools. Now we need to\nbetween agent and tools. Now we need to obviously create this edge because the\nobviously create this edge because the\nobviously create this edge because the agent needs to go to the tools right and\nagent needs to go to the tools right and\nagent needs to go to the tools right and then this edge this directed edge and\nthen this edge this directed edge and\nthen this edge this directed edge and this conditional edge creates the loop\nthis conditional edge creates the loop\nthis conditional edge creates the loop uh which will allow for the human AI\nuh which will allow for the human AI\nuh which will allow for the human AI collaboration. All right. Okay. So now\ncollaboration. All right. Okay. So now\ncollaboration. All right. Okay. So now we add the conditional edge and that's\nwe add the conditional edge and that's\nwe add the conditional edge and that's the conditional edge which I was talking\nthe conditional edge which I was talking\nthe conditional edge which I was talking about the continue at the end aka this\nabout the continue at the end aka this\nabout the continue at the end aka this condition this conditional edge from\ncondition this conditional edge from\ncondition this conditional edge from tools. Okay.\ntools. Okay.\ntools. Okay. And now the last thing we need to do is\nAnd now the last thing we need to do is\nAnd now the last thing we need to do is just compile it because we've finished\njust compile it because we've finished\njust compile it because we've finished the graph completely, right? There's\nthe graph completely, right? There's\nthe graph completely, right? There's nothing left. We've done the start\nnothing left. We've done the start\nnothing left. We've done the start point, we've done the end point, the\npoint, we've done the end point, the\npoint, we've done the end point, the end, this conditional edges done, the\nend, this conditional edges done, the\nend, this conditional edges done, the nodes done, and then this directed edge\nnodes done, and then this directed edge\nnodes done, and then this directed edge is done and the start point is obviously\nis done and the start point is obviously\nis done and the start point is obviously done because we've uh created a\ndone because we've uh created a\ndone because we've uh created a directed. So you can see the entire\ndirected. So you can see the entire\ndirected. So you can see the entire graph we have created just like that. So\ngraph we have created just like that. So\ngraph we have created just like that. So again, nothing too\nagain, nothing too\nagain, nothing too hard. Cool. Okay. So now we actually run\nhard. Cool. Okay. So now we actually run\nhard. Cool. Okay. So now we actually run the program. And to run it, I have just\nthe program. And to run it, I have just\nthe program. And to run it, I have just written this um function so that\nwritten this um function so that\nwritten this um function so that everything is in a more compact way.\neverything is in a more compact way.\neverything is in a more compact way. This is just to invoke the graph. Okay.\nThis is just to invoke the graph. Okay.\nThis is just to invoke the graph. Okay. And let's do that. So that was the\nAnd let's do that. So that was the\nAnd let's do that. So that was the entire code. And this code will allow\nentire code. And this code will allow\nentire code. And this code will allow for human AI collaboration. Now, yes, we\nfor human AI collaboration. Now, yes, we\nfor human AI collaboration. Now, yes, we used a global variable. And again, there\nused a global variable. And again, there\nused a global variable. And again, there is nothing wrong with using a global\nis nothing wrong with using a global\nis nothing wrong with using a global variable. I know some of you might frown\nvariable. I know some of you might frown\nvariable. I know some of you might frown upon it, but um again, there's nothing\nupon it, but um again, there's nothing\nupon it, but um again, there's nothing wrong with it. If we wanted to use more\nwrong with it. If we wanted to use more\nwrong with it. If we wanted to use more complicated uh form uh complicated uh\ncomplicated uh form uh complicated uh\ncomplicated uh form uh complicated uh stuff from langraph like the injected\nstuff from langraph like the injected\nstuff from langraph like the injected state or even using something like\nstate or even using something like\nstate or even using something like commands and interrupts uh we would have\ncommands and interrupts uh we would have\ncommands and interrupts uh we would have to write the code slightly differently\nto write the code slightly differently\nto write the code slightly differently but because this is a beginner level\nbut because this is a beginner level\nbut because this is a beginner level course uh we've just disregarded that\ncourse uh we've just disregarded that\ncourse uh we've just disregarded that completely and we found another way of\ncompletely and we found another way of\ncompletely and we found another way of performing human AI collaboration.\nperforming human AI collaboration.\nperforming human AI collaboration. Awesome. So let's actually run this now.\nAwesome. So let's actually run this now.\nAwesome. So let's actually run this now.

But if you wanted to, we could have written\nwanted to, we could have written\nwanted to, we could have written something over here uh with our pre with\nsomething over here uh with our pre with\nsomething over here uh with our pre with a already existing email or already\na already existing email or already\na already existing email or already existing document and then it could the\nexisting document and then it could the\nexisting document and then it could the model the agentic system would know that\nmodel the agentic system would know that\nmodel the agentic system would know that this is what the content is the current\nthis is what the content is the current\nthis is what the content is the current content how would you like to uh change\ncontent how would you like to uh change\ncontent how would you like to uh change that and that is exactly how uh we will\nthat and that is exactly how uh we will\nthat and that is exactly how uh we will be able to operate on our existing ones.\nbe able to operate on our existing ones.\nbe able to operate on our existing ones. So you can see that this is quite a\nSo you can see that this is quite a\nSo you can see that this is quite a robust thing. If we want another\nrobust thing. If we want another\nrobust thing. If we want another example, for example, uh let's say\nexample, for example, uh let's say\nexample, for example, uh let's say python drafter.\npy. Okay, now watch this as well. Look\npy. Okay, now watch this as well. Look how robust this is. If I say something\nhow robust this is. If I say something\nhow robust this is. If I say something like write an\nemail, it actually gives back questions.\nemail, it actually gives back questions. So sure, what would you like the email\nSo sure, what would you like the email\nSo sure, what would you like the email to say? D. So remember, it didn't even\nto say? D. So remember, it didn't even\nto say? D. So remember, it didn't even go through any tool here. uh using\ngo through any tool here. uh using\ngo through any tool here. uh using langraph we can really make the agents\nlangraph we can really make the agents\nlangraph we can really make the agents quite robust and that's the thing which\nquite robust and that's the thing which\nquite robust and that's the thing which I wanted to show you it doesn't always\nI wanted to show you it doesn't always\nI wanted to show you it doesn't always have to pick a tool its own like LLM\nhave to pick a tool its own like LLM\nhave to pick a tool its own like LLM like the agent itself cuz remember the\nlike the agent itself cuz remember the\nlike the agent itself cuz remember the agent node has an LLM in the background\nagent node has an LLM in the background\nagent node has an LLM in the background back end the bind tools function allows\nback end the bind tools function allows\nback end the bind tools function allows it allows it scope like it increases the\nit allows it scope like it increases the\nit allows it scope like it increases the scope of it uh by providing some tools\nscope of it uh by providing some tools\nscope of it uh by providing some tools but that doesn't mean it has to use\nbut that doesn't mean it has to use\nbut that doesn't mean it has to use those tools if it doesn't feel like the\nthose tools if it doesn't feel like the\nthose tools if it doesn't feel like the need to use the tools it won't and in\nneed to use the tools it won't and in\nneed to use the tools it won't and in this case it wanted to ask us more\nthis case it wanted to ask us more\nthis case it wanted to ask us more questions about it. So it would say show\nquestions about it. So it would say show\nquestions about it. So it would say show what would you like this email to say\nwhat would you like this email to say\nwhat would you like this email to say because to be fair I only wrote three\nbecause to be fair I only wrote three\nbecause to be fair I only wrote three words. Uh but that was what I was trying\nwords. Uh but that was what I was trying\nwords. Uh but that was what I was trying to show you. So let's just clear this\nto show you. So let's just clear this\nto show you. So let's just clear this now cuz we don't need to. And yeah you\nnow cuz we don't need to. And yeah you\nnow cuz we don't need to. And yeah you can see perfectly works human AI\ncan see perfectly works human AI\ncan see perfectly works human AI collaboration in langraph and this is\ncollaboration in langraph and this is\ncollaboration in langraph and this is actually somewhat useful as well. Now\nactually somewhat useful as well. Now\nactually somewhat useful as well. Now yes of course you can use GPT4 canvas\nyes of course you can use GPT4 canvas\nyes of course you can use GPT4 canvas and all of that stuff of course but um\nand all of that stuff of course but um\nand all of that stuff of course but um this is how you would do it in Lagraph.\nthis is how you would do it in Lagraph.\nthis is how you would do it in Lagraph. All right. So, if you would like an\nAll right. So, if you would like an\nAll right. So, if you would like an extension to this, what you could do is\nextension to this, what you could do is\nextension to this, what you could do is add a voice feature as well. So, maybe\nadd a voice feature as well. So, maybe\nadd a voice feature as well. So, maybe you could add use OpenAI whisper for uh\nyou could add use OpenAI whisper for uh\nyou could add use OpenAI whisper for uh speech to text conversion or add 11 laps\nspeech to text conversion or add 11 laps\nspeech to text conversion or add 11 laps for text to speech conversion and maybe\nfor text to speech conversion and maybe\nfor text to speech conversion and maybe you can make it voice based cuz right\nyou can make it voice based cuz right\nyou can make it voice based cuz right now I'm giving it I'm how am I\nnow I'm giving it I'm how am I\nnow I'm giving it I'm how am I communicating it with text mode? What\ncommunicating it with text mode? What\ncommunicating it with text mode? What about voice mode? You could also include\nabout voice mode? You could also include\nabout voice mode? You could also include a GUI to this. There's a lot of stuff\na GUI to this. There's a lot of stuff\na GUI to this. There's a lot of stuff which you can do on you can even have\nwhich you can do on you can even have\nwhich you can do on you can even have your own knowledge base as well and\nyour own knowledge base as well and\nyour own knowledge base as well and include that. So a lot of potential with\ninclude that. So a lot of potential with\ninclude that. So a lot of potential with this if you want a homework for this uh\nthis if you want a homework for this uh\nthis if you want a homework for this uh specific project that there you go. All\nspecific project that there you go. All\nspecific project that there you go. All right. Okay. Cool. So that's the end of\nright. Okay. Cool. So that's the end of\nright. Okay. Cool. So that's the end of this\nthis\nthis subsection. Awesome. So now let's build\nsubsection. Awesome. So now let's build\nsubsection. Awesome. So now let's build our fifth AI agent. And some of you\nour fifth AI agent. And some of you\nour fifth AI agent. And some of you might have been looking forward to this.\nmight have been looking forward to this.\nmight have been looking forward to this. It's retrieval augmented generation rag.\nIt's retrieval augmented generation rag.\nIt's retrieval augmented generation rag. So what will the graph look like? It\nSo what will the graph look like? It\nSo what will the graph look like? It will look something like this. Again,\nwill look something like this. Again,\nwill look something like this. Again, start point, end point, really similar\nstart point, end point, really similar\nstart point, end point, really similar to what a react agent was, right? But uh\nto what a react agent was, right? But uh\nto what a react agent was, right? But uh we have two agents in this case. We have\nwe have two agents in this case. We have\nwe have two agents in this case. We have a retriever agent and we have our main\na retriever agent and we have our main\na retriever agent and we have our main agent LLM, right? So, and it will have\nagent LLM, right? So, and it will have\nagent LLM, right? So, and it will have obviously a conditional edge, a loop,\nobviously a conditional edge, a loop,\nobviously a conditional edge, a loop, and everything. Again, we're bringing\nand everything. Again, we're bringing\nand everything. Again, we're bringing everything we've learned so far and\neverything we've learned so far and\neverything we've learned so far and merging them into one. And we're also\nmerging them into one. And we're also\nmerging them into one. And we're also going to be learning about a little bit\ngoing to be learning about a little bit\ngoing to be learning about a little bit about rag. Now, I'll assume you know\nabout rag. Now, I'll assume you know\nabout rag. Now, I'll assume you know what rag is. I'm not going to go too\nwhat rag is. I'm not going to go too\nwhat rag is. I'm not going to go too much in detail into like the\nmuch in detail into like the\nmuch in detail into like the nitty-gritty of it. But again, in the\nnitty-gritty of it. But again, in the\nnitty-gritty of it. But again, in the surface level, I will obviously explain\nsurface level, I will obviously explain\nsurface level, I will obviously explain what rag is about and everything. Okay.\nwhat rag is about and everything. Okay.\nwhat rag is about and everything. Okay. So, if you're excited, let's uh let's\nSo, if you're excited, let's uh let's\nSo, if you're excited, let's uh let's jump to the\njump to the\njump to the code. Okay. So, now you can see that\ncode. Okay. So, now you can see that\ncode. Okay. So, now you can see that I've already done all of the imports\nI've already done all of the imports\nI've already done all of the imports which we'll need. But you'll notice how\nwhich we'll need. But you'll notice how\nwhich we'll need. But you'll notice how there are these four imports which we\nthere are these four imports which we\nthere are these four imports which we haven't come across yet. Now, rather\nhaven't come across yet. Now, rather\nhaven't come across yet. Now, rather than explain them from the get- go, I\nthan explain them from the get- go, I\nthan explain them from the get- go, I will explain them as they come because\nwill explain them as they come because\nwill explain them as they come because it'll make more sense. uh it'll make\nit'll make more sense. uh it'll make\nit'll make more sense. uh it'll make more intuitive sense that way. Okay. So\nmore intuitive sense that way. Okay. So\nmore intuitive sense that way. Okay. So now I'm going to be loading our uh ENV\nnow I'm going to be loading our uh ENV\nnow I'm going to be loading our uh ENV file which contains all the API keys.\nfile which contains all the API keys.\nfile which contains all the API keys. And this time I'm going to be\nAnd this time I'm going to be\nAnd this time I'm going to be initializing our LLM differently. Well,\ninitializing our LLM differently. Well,\ninitializing our LLM differently. Well, slightly differently. It's the same LLM,\nslightly differently. It's the same LLM,\nslightly differently. It's the same LLM, but why did I say differently? Because\nbut why did I say differently? Because\nbut why did I say differently? Because I've passed in a new parameter called\nI've passed in a new parameter called\nI've passed in a new parameter called temperature. Now for those of you who do\ntemperature. Now for those of you who do\ntemperature. Now for those of you who do not know what temperature is, it's\nnot know what temperature is, it's\nnot know what temperature is, it's essentially a parameter which depicts\nessentially a parameter which depicts\nessentially a parameter which depicts how stochastic the model outputs how\nhow stochastic the model outputs how\nhow stochastic the model outputs how stoastic you want the model outputs to\nstoastic you want the model outputs to\nstoastic you want the model outputs to be. So because I've set it to be zero,\nbe. So because I've set it to be zero,\nbe. So because I've set it to be zero, temperature equal to zero makes the\ntemperature equal to zero makes the\ntemperature equal to zero makes the model output more deterministic.\nmodel output more deterministic.\nmodel output more deterministic. Similarly, if I had set the temperature\nSimilarly, if I had set the temperature\nSimilarly, if I had set the temperature to be one, the model output would have\nto be one, the model output would have\nto be one, the model output would have been more stochastic. Okay. So now we\nbeen more stochastic. Okay. So now we\nbeen more stochastic. Okay. So now we create the embedding\ncreate the embedding\ncreate the embedding model. And the embedding model uh is\nmodel. And the embedding model uh is\nmodel. And the embedding model uh is what's going to convert our text into\nwhat's going to convert our text into\nwhat's going to convert our text into vector embeddings. Right? Uh so this\nvector embeddings. Right? Uh so this\nvector embeddings. Right? Uh so this will be the layout for it. Now please\nwill be the layout for it. Now please\nwill be the layout for it. Now please note one important thing which is the\nnote one important thing which is the\nnote one important thing which is the embedding model has to be compatible\nembedding model has to be compatible\nembedding model has to be compatible with the LLM we're using. You can use\nwith the LLM we're using. You can use\nwith the LLM we're using. You can use whatever LLM you want but make sure the\nwhatever LLM you want but make sure the\nwhatever LLM you want but make sure the embedding model uh is compatible with\nembedding model uh is compatible with\nembedding model uh is compatible with it. For example uh let's say we're using\nit. For example uh let's say we're using\nit. For example uh let's say we're using GBD40 uh an open model but the embedding\nGBD40 uh an open model but the embedding\nGBD40 uh an open model but the embedding model we're using is from Olama some\nmodel we're using is from Olama some\nmodel we're using is from Olama some random model. Now that they wouldn't\nrandom model. Now that they wouldn't\nrandom model. Now that they wouldn't most likely they're not going to be\nmost likely they're not going to be\nmost likely they're not going to be compatible. Why? Because there's so many\ncompatible. Why? Because there's so many\ncompatible. Why? Because there's so many differences between them. One potential\ndifferences between them. One potential\ndifferences between them. One potential difference could be the vector\ndifference could be the vector\ndifference could be the vector dimension. So just a rule of thumb. Make\ndimension. So just a rule of thumb. Make\ndimension. So just a rule of thumb. Make sure the LLM and the embedding model is\nsure the LLM and the embedding model is\nsure the LLM and the embedding model is compatible. Okay. Awesome. So now we're\ncompatible. Okay. Awesome. So now we're\ncompatible. Okay. Awesome. So now we're going to specify the PDF part. So this\ngoing to specify the PDF part. So this\ngoing to specify the PDF part. So this is the stock market performance 2024\nis the stock market performance 2024\nis the stock market performance 2024 PDF. And essentially this is just a\nPDF. And essentially this is just a\nPDF. And essentially this is just a document which I created which contains\ndocument which I created which contains\ndocument which I created which contains um a lot about the stock market\num a lot about the stock market\num a lot about the stock market performance. Okay. Uh I can show you\nperformance. Okay. Uh I can show you\nperformance. Okay. Uh I can show you that right now actually. So this\nthat right now actually. So this\nthat right now actually. So this contains nine pages and is just a\ncontains nine pages and is just a\ncontains nine pages and is just a document containing about some stock\ndocument containing about some stock\ndocument containing about some stock market details in 2024. Okay. Awesome.\nmarket details in 2024. Okay. Awesome.\nmarket details in 2024. Okay. Awesome. So now um in case you've specified the\nSo now um in case you've specified the\nSo now um in case you've specified the uh you have put the PDF in a wrong\nuh you have put the PDF in a wrong\nuh you have put the PDF in a wrong directory or if it can't find it uh this\ndirectory or if it can't find it uh this\ndirectory or if it can't find it uh this error will pop up. So again I've just\nerror will pop up. So again I've just\nerror will pop up. So again I've just put this for debugging purposes if you\nput this for debugging purposes if you\nput this for debugging purposes if you use the code which I provided on GitHub.\nuse the code which I provided on GitHub.\nuse the code which I provided on GitHub. Okay. Now this will load the PDF and you\nOkay. Now this will load the PDF and you\nOkay. Now this will load the PDF and you can see pi PDF loader is one of the\ncan see pi PDF loader is one of the\ncan see pi PDF loader is one of the imports which we made here. So again\nimports which we made here. So again\nimports which we made here. So again it's in the name and the common. It just\nit's in the name and the common. It just\nit's in the name and the common. It just simply loads the PDF. Okay. Uh and this\nsimply loads the PDF. Okay. Uh and this\nsimply loads the PDF. Okay. Uh and this try and accept command uh just checks if\ntry and accept command uh just checks if\ntry and accept command uh just checks if the PDF is there. And pages is equal to\nthe PDF is there. And pages is equal to\nthe PDF is there. And pages is equal to PDF loader.load. So this essentially\nPDF loader.load. So this essentially\nPDF loader.load. So this essentially says how many pages are there in the\nsays how many pages are there in the\nsays how many pages are there in the document. So you can see there's nine\ndocument. So you can see there's nine\ndocument. So you can see there's nine pages in our document. So if I run this\npages in our document. So if I run this\npages in our document. So if I run this command, if I run this, so clear\ncommand, if I run this, so clear\ncommand, if I run this, so clear python rag agent.py\npython rag agent.py\npython rag agent.py py it should say nine\npy it should say nine\npy it should say nine pages.\npages.\npages. So there we go. PDF has been loaded and\nSo there we go. PDF has been loaded and\nSo there we go. PDF has been loaded and has nine pages as expected. Right? Okay.\nhas nine pages as expected. Right? Okay.\nhas nine pages as expected. Right? Okay. Now it's time for the chunking process.\nNow it's time for the chunking process.\nNow it's time for the chunking process. Now what is chunking? First look at\nNow what is chunking? First look at\nNow what is chunking? First look at this. There are two parameters which\nthis. There are two parameters which\nthis. There are two parameters which I've specified. Chunk size which is\nI've specified. Chunk size which is\nI've specified. Chunk size which is a,000 and chunk overlap which is 200. So\na,000 and chunk overlap which is 200. So\na,000 and chunk overlap which is 200. So let's break this down a bit. Going back\nlet's break this down a bit. Going back\nlet's break this down a bit. Going back to our document. So chunk size was 1,000\nto our document. So chunk size was 1,000\nto our document. So chunk size was 1,000 tokens. So let's say that this was a\ntokens. So let's say that this was a\ntokens. So let's say that this was a chunk for example. Okay, obviously\nchunk for example. Okay, obviously\nchunk for example. Okay, obviously that's not going to be a thousand\nthat's not going to be a thousand\nthat's not going to be a thousand tokens, but just as like uh\ntokens, but just as like uh\ntokens, but just as like uh demonstration purposes, let's assume it\ndemonstration purposes, let's assume it\ndemonstration purposes, let's assume it is. So this is saying as soon as you've\nis. So this is saying as soon as you've\nis. So this is saying as soon as you've reached 1,000 tokens, you create a new\nreached 1,000 tokens, you create a new\nreached 1,000 tokens, you create a new chunk. So let's say 1,000 tokens ended\nchunk. So let's say 1,000 tokens ended\nchunk. So let's say 1,000 tokens ended here. So this would be the start of a\nhere. So this would be the start of a\nhere. So this would be the start of a new chunk like such. Okay. And you keep\nnew chunk like such. Okay. And you keep\nnew chunk like such. Okay. And you keep going and going and going until the end\ngoing and going and going until the end\ngoing and going and going until the end of the document. But what if the what\nof the document. But what if the what\nof the document. But what if the what about the second parameter? The second\nabout the second parameter? The second\nabout the second parameter? The second parameter is specified overlap and\nparameter is specified overlap and\nparameter is specified overlap and that's essentially saying let me use it\nthat's essentially saying let me use it\nthat's essentially saying let me use it in a different color that your chunks\nin a different color that your chunks\nin a different color that your chunks consecutive chunks should have some\nconsecutive chunks should have some\nconsecutive chunks should have some tokens um which are which exist in both\ntokens um which are which exist in both\ntokens um which are which exist in both for example because it was 200 the\nfor example because it was 200 the\nfor example because it was 200 the second chunk is not going to start from\nsecond chunk is not going to start from\nsecond chunk is not going to start from here. It's actually going to start\nhere. It's actually going to start\nhere. It's actually going to start something like\nsomething like\nsomething like this. They're obviously going to be the\nthis. They're obviously going to be the\nthis. They're obviously going to be the same length uh in terms of tokens but\nsame length uh in terms of tokens but\nsame length uh in terms of tokens but they will have some tokens which will be\nthey will have some tokens which will be\nthey will have some tokens which will be in both chunks. So for example, this\nin both chunks. So for example, this\nin both chunks. So for example, this part will be in both cuz that's the\npart will be in both cuz that's the\npart will be in both cuz that's the overlap. 200 tokens to be precise. Okay,\noverlap. 200 tokens to be precise. Okay,\noverlap. 200 tokens to be precise. Okay, so that was just a brief overview of\nso that was just a brief overview of\nso that was just a brief overview of what chunks are in uh rag. Okay, so\nwhat chunks are in uh rag. Okay, so\nwhat chunks are in uh rag. Okay, so that's that part done. And again, this\nthat's that part done. And again, this\nthat's that part done. And again, this recursive character text splitter is one\nrecursive character text splitter is one\nrecursive character text splitter is one of the imports we did. Okay,\nof the imports we did. Okay,\nof the imports we did. Okay, so this text splitter um chunking\nso this text splitter um chunking\nso this text splitter um chunking process, we now apply it to all of the\nprocess, we now apply it to all of the\nprocess, we now apply it to all of the pages, all of our nine pages in our\npages, all of our nine pages in our\npages, all of our nine pages in our document. Okay.\ndocument. Okay.\ndocument. Okay. And this piece of code essentially\nAnd this piece of code essentially\nAnd this piece of code essentially saying this, the chroma vector database,\nsaying this, the chroma vector database,\nsaying this, the chroma vector database, we're going to be using a chroma vector\nwe're going to be using a chroma vector\nwe're going to be using a chroma vector database to store all of our vector\ndatabase to store all of our vector\ndatabase to store all of our vector embeddings, by the way. But the uh the\nembeddings, by the way. But the uh the\nembeddings, by the way. But the uh the place where we want our chroma vector\nplace where we want our chroma vector\nplace where we want our chroma vector database to be will be specified in this\ndatabase to be will be specified in this\ndatabase to be will be specified in this file path. And the collection's name\nfile path. And the collection's name\nfile path. And the collection's name will be called stock market. Now, you\nwill be called stock market. Now, you\nwill be called stock market. Now, you can specify it wherever you want\ncan specify it wherever you want\ncan specify it wherever you want obviously, but I've just specified it to\nobviously, but I've just specified it to\nobviously, but I've just specified it to be in the same\nbe in the same\nbe in the same folder. Okay.\nfolder. Okay.\nfolder. Okay. So this is just an if statement to make\nSo this is just an if statement to make\nSo this is just an if statement to make sure that uh if this is the first time\nsure that uh if this is the first time\nsure that uh if this is the first time we're running this command uh if we're\nwe're running this command uh if we're\nwe're running this command uh if we're running this file uh if this collection\nrunning this file uh if this collection\nrunning this file uh if this collection doesn't exist we will create the um\ndoesn't exist we will create the um\ndoesn't exist we will create the um collection in the specified directory.\ncollection in the specified directory.\ncollection in the specified directory. Okay, again not too hard yet. Now here\nOkay, again not too hard yet. Now here\nOkay, again not too hard yet. Now here comes a try except command u try accept\ncomes a try except command u try accept\ncomes a try except command u try accept block. So this is where we actually\nblock. So this is where we actually\nblock. So this is where we actually create the vector embedding uh where we\ncreate the vector embedding uh where we\ncreate the vector embedding uh where we create the chroma vector um\ncreate the chroma vector um\ncreate the chroma vector um database and these are just parameters\ndatabase and these are just parameters\ndatabase and these are just parameters which I specify. So for example, how I\nwhich I specify. So for example, how I\nwhich I specify. So for example, how I want the pages to be split, what\nwant the pages to be split, what\nwant the pages to be split, what embeddings to use, where to store it and\nembeddings to use, where to store it and\nembeddings to use, where to store it and the collection name. The collection name\nthe collection name. The collection name\nthe collection name. The collection name being stock market, right? And if there\nbeing stock market, right? And if there\nbeing stock market, right? And if there is an error, it will throw an error and\nis an error, it will throw an error and\nis an error, it will throw an error and if it's successful, it'll print on the\nif it's successful, it'll print on the\nif it's successful, it'll print on the terminal. Okay, awesome. So now we\nterminal. Okay, awesome. So now we\nterminal. Okay, awesome. So now we create something called a retriever. So\ncreate something called a retriever. So\ncreate something called a retriever. So the retriever is quite important in rag.\nthe retriever is quite important in rag.\nthe retriever is quite important in rag. It's well obviously the first part of\nIt's well obviously the first part of\nIt's well obviously the first part of rag retrieval augmented generation. So\nrag retrieval augmented generation. So\nrag retrieval augmented generation. So the retriever is what actually well\nthe retriever is what actually well\nthe retriever is what actually well retrieves the chunks the most similar\nretrieves the chunks the most similar\nretrieves the chunks the most similar chunks. Um the search type which we're\nchunks. Um the search type which we're\nchunks. Um the search type which we're going to use similarity. It's just the\ngoing to use similarity. It's just the\ngoing to use similarity. It's just the default anyway. Uh you don't really need\ndefault anyway. Uh you don't really need\ndefault anyway. Uh you don't really need to know how that works to be honest. But\nto know how that works to be honest. But\nto know how that works to be honest. But what you do need to know is this part.\nwhat you do need to know is this part.\nwhat you do need to know is this part. So in this code I have made sure that\nSo in this code I have made sure that\nSo in this code I have made sure that every time uh it goes the amount of\nevery time uh it goes the amount of\nevery time uh it goes the amount of chunks it uh outputs back is five. Why?\nchunks it uh outputs back is five. Why?\nchunks it uh outputs back is five. Why? Because k here is the amount of chunks\nBecause k here is the amount of chunks\nBecause k here is the amount of chunks to be returned. So I've set it as five.\nto be returned. So I've set it as five.\nto be returned. So I've set it as five. Now I'm pretty sure if we go to the\nNow I'm pretty sure if we go to the\nNow I'm pretty sure if we go to the actual documents here the default the\nactual documents here the default the\nactual documents here the default the default is four. Okay. So uh this is\ndefault is four. Okay. So uh this is\ndefault is four. Okay. So uh this is just a parameter which you can uh set.\njust a parameter which you can uh set.\njust a parameter which you can uh set. Now you don't want it to be too high of\nNow you don't want it to be too high of\nNow you don't want it to be too high of course or too low. So you want like a\ncourse or too low. So you want like a\ncourse or too low. So you want like a good middle ground and 405 is a good\ngood middle ground and 405 is a good\ngood middle ground and 405 is a good middle ground in my opinion. Okay. So\nmiddle ground in my opinion. Okay. So\nmiddle ground in my opinion. Okay. So now let's create our tool. So again we\nnow let's create our tool. So again we\nnow let's create our tool. So again we use decorator tool. And the tool's name\nuse decorator tool. And the tool's name\nuse decorator tool. And the tool's name is going to be this retriever tool. It\nis going to be this retriever tool. It\nis going to be this retriever tool. It will input it will take in a query and\nwill input it will take in a query and\nwill input it will take in a query and it'll output a string. So the dock\nit'll output a string. So the dock\nit'll output a string. So the dock string is as follows. This tool searches\nstring is as follows. This tool searches\nstring is as follows. This tool searches and returns the information from our\nand returns the information from our\nand returns the information from our document. Okay self-explanatory.\ndocument. Okay self-explanatory.\ndocument. Okay self-explanatory. uh and obviously we need to invoke it to\nuh and obviously we need to invoke it to\nuh and obviously we need to invoke it to the retriever. So whatever query we ask\nthe retriever. So whatever query we ask\nthe retriever. So whatever query we ask for example uh what was Apple's\nfor example uh what was Apple's\nfor example uh what was Apple's performance in 2024 that will be the\nperformance in 2024 that will be the\nperformance in 2024 that will be the query and that will be passed to our\nquery and that will be passed to our\nquery and that will be passed to our retriever which will grab all the chunks\nretriever which will grab all the chunks\nretriever which will grab all the chunks the most the top five most similar\nthe most the top five most similar\nthe most the top five most similar chunks. Okay. Now if we don't if there's\nchunks. Okay. Now if we don't if there's\nchunks. Okay. Now if we don't if there's nothing similar uh which it finds for\nnothing similar uh which it finds for\nnothing similar uh which it finds for example if I say something like uh who's\nexample if I say something like uh who's\nexample if I say something like uh who's Bob the builder something like that\nBob the builder something like that\nBob the builder something like that right obviously Bob the builder is not\nright obviously Bob the builder is not\nright obviously Bob the builder is not in this document uh so it will return as\nin this document uh so it will return as\nin this document uh so it will return as I found no relevance information in the\nI found no relevance information in the\nI found no relevance information in the document and uh this will be passed to\ndocument and uh this will be passed to\ndocument and uh this will be passed to our LLM agent okay if it does find it\nour LLM agent okay if it does find it\nour LLM agent okay if it does find it though what we'll do is we'll create an\nthough what we'll do is we'll create an\nthough what we'll do is we'll create an empty list and we will store all of the\nempty list and we will store all of the\nempty list and we will store all of the similarity\nsimilarity\nsimilarity um us the all of the chunks which it\num us the all of the chunks which it\num us the all of the chunks which it found and then return those results uh\nfound and then return those results uh\nfound and then return those results uh through this. Okay, still it's quite\nthrough this. Okay, still it's quite\nthrough this. Okay, still it's quite easy still uh and this piece of code\neasy still uh and this piece of code\neasy still uh and this piece of code we've already come across. There is only\nwe've already come across. There is only\nwe've already come across. There is only one tool. So we just bind that tool to\none tool. So we just bind that tool to\none tool. So we just bind that tool to our\nour\nour LLM. And this also code we have also\nLLM. And this also code we have also\nLLM. And this also code we have also we've uh done many times. It's the uh\nwe've uh done many times. It's the uh\nwe've uh done many times. It's the uh creation of the agent state. And again\ncreation of the agent state. And again\ncreation of the agent state. And again we're using our add messages reducer\nwe're using our add messages reducer\nwe're using our add messages reducer function. All of this we've covered many\nfunction. All of this we've covered many\nfunction. All of this we've covered many times so you should be quite familiar\ntimes so you should be quite familiar\ntimes so you should be quite familiar with it. Okay. So now we create the\nwith it. Okay. So now we create the\nwith it. Okay. So now we create the should continue function and the should\nshould continue function and the should\nshould continue function and the should continue function uh is going to be the\ncontinue function uh is going to be the\ncontinue function uh is going to be the underlying function between our\nunderlying function between our\nunderlying function between our conditional edge behind our conditional\nconditional edge behind our conditional\nconditional edge behind our conditional edge. So it will check if the last\nedge. So it will check if the last\nedge. So it will check if the last message contains any tool calls. If it\nmessage contains any tool calls. If it\nmessage contains any tool calls. If it does then we um proceed. If it doesn't\ndoes then we um proceed. If it doesn't\ndoes then we um proceed. If it doesn't then we'll just end\nright. Okay. So now we specify the\nright. Okay. So now we specify the system prompt. Now this system prompt is\nsystem prompt. Now this system prompt is\nsystem prompt. Now this system prompt is going to be quite big. So let me copy\ngoing to be quite big. So let me copy\ngoing to be quite big. So let me copy and paste it here. Now the reason is\nand paste it here. Now the reason is\nand paste it here. Now the reason is quite big is I want to specify as much\nquite big is I want to specify as much\nquite big is I want to specify as much information to the LLM so that it knows\ninformation to the LLM so that it knows\ninformation to the LLM so that it knows what to do. Right? So I've just said\nwhat to do. Right? So I've just said\nwhat to do. Right? So I've just said you're an intelligent AI assistant who\nyou're an intelligent AI assistant who\nyou're an intelligent AI assistant who answers questions about the document uh\nanswers questions about the document uh\nanswers questions about the document uh loaded into your knowledge base. Uh you\nloaded into your knowledge base. Uh you\nloaded into your knowledge base. Uh you can read the rest if you would like. But\ncan read the rest if you would like. But\ncan read the rest if you would like. But I've also written this. Please always\nI've also written this. Please always\nI've also written this. Please always site the specific parts of the document\nsite the specific parts of the document\nsite the specific parts of the document you use in your answers. This is really\nyou use in your answers. This is really\nyou use in your answers. This is really just to make sure it's not\njust to make sure it's not\njust to make sure it's not hallucinating. Right? because as we know\nhallucinating. Right? because as we know\nhallucinating. Right? because as we know hallucination is quite a big problem\nhallucination is quite a big problem\nhallucination is quite a big problem with LLMs. So this is just to make sure\nwith LLMs. So this is just to make sure\nwith LLMs. So this is just to make sure um hallucinations are kept to a bare\num hallucinations are kept to a bare\num hallucinations are kept to a bare minimum. Okay. All right. So now we\nminimum. Okay. All right. So now we\nminimum. Okay. All right. So now we create a dictionary of our tools and we\ncreate a dictionary of our tools and we\ncreate a dictionary of our tools and we now create the underlying function which\nnow create the underlying function which\nnow create the underlying function which will be our LLM agent. So this function\nwill be our LLM agent. So this function\nwill be our LLM agent. So this function will call the LLM with the current state\nwill call the LLM with the current state\nwill call the LLM with the current state and you can see it converts the messages\nand you can see it converts the messages\nand you can see it converts the messages to a list passes the system messages and\nto a list passes the system messages and\nto a list passes the system messages and passes it to our LLM which is defined\npasses it to our LLM which is defined\npasses it to our LLM which is defined like this and it will just return the\nlike this and it will just return the\nlike this and it will just return the messages aka the updated\nmessages aka the updated\nmessages aka the updated state. Okay, this should be like such.\nstate. Okay, this should be like such.\nstate. Okay, this should be like such. Okay, awesome. So now we create our\nOkay, awesome. So now we create our\nOkay, awesome. So now we create our second agent which will be the retriever\nsecond agent which will be the retriever\nsecond agent which will be the retriever agent which you saw on the in the graph\nagent which you saw on the in the graph\nagent which you saw on the in the graph which I showed you in the introduction.\nwhich I showed you in the introduction.\nwhich I showed you in the introduction. So the retriever agent executes the tool\nSo the retriever agent executes the tool\nSo the retriever agent executes the tool calls from the LLM response. So what is\ncalls from the LLM response. So what is\ncalls from the LLM response. So what is this code actually saying? Well, all in\nthis code actually saying? Well, all in\nthis code actually saying? Well, all in all, this massive piece of code really\nall, this massive piece of code really\nall, this massive piece of code really just says if there is a tool, if the\njust says if there is a tool, if the\njust says if there is a tool, if the tool name is within the is a proper\ntool name is within the is a proper\ntool name is within the is a proper specified tool, aka if it's retriever\nspecified tool, aka if it's retriever\nspecified tool, aka if it's retriever tool, then actually run it. If it's not,\ntool, then actually run it. If it's not,\ntool, then actually run it. If it's not, then we will output the result as input\nthen we will output the result as input\nthen we will output the result as input in incorrect tool name. Please retry and\nin incorrect tool name. Please retry and\nin incorrect tool name. Please retry and select the tool from list of available\nselect the tool from list of available\nselect the tool from list of available tools. It's just for checking if a if\ntools. It's just for checking if a if\ntools. It's just for checking if a if the tool which is decided from the LLM\nthe tool which is decided from the LLM\nthe tool which is decided from the LLM is valid or not. So that's all what this\nis valid or not. So that's all what this\nis valid or not. So that's all what this is doing. If it is valid, it will invoke\nis doing. If it is valid, it will invoke\nis doing. If it is valid, it will invoke it and we will store the results uh like\nit and we will store the results uh like\nit and we will store the results uh like this and we will return that. Okay.\nthis and we will return that. Okay.\nthis and we will return that. Okay. Again this should be agent state like\nAgain this should be agent state like\nAgain this should be agent state like such. Okay. So we've created all of our\nsuch. Okay. So we've created all of our\nsuch. Okay. So we've created all of our our two um AI agents now and now we're\nour two um AI agents now and now we're\nour two um AI agents now and now we're going to create the graph itself. So\ngoing to create the graph itself. So\ngoing to create the graph itself. So like how we've done initialize it\nlike how we've done initialize it\nlike how we've done initialize it through state graph and then we're going\nthrough state graph and then we're going\nthrough state graph and then we're going to add our two AI agents as nodes with\nto add our two AI agents as nodes with\nto add our two AI agents as nodes with their respective\ntheir respective\ntheir respective actions and we are now going to add the\nactions and we are now going to add the\nactions and we are now going to add the conditional edge. So which will be llm\nconditional edge. So which will be llm\nconditional edge. So which will be llm which will be start from l lm and the\nwhich will be start from l lm and the\nwhich will be start from l lm and the should continue function is the function\nshould continue function is the function\nshould continue function is the function which will be um the underlying function\nwhich will be um the underlying function\nwhich will be um the underlying function and this is a uh true false statement\nand this is a uh true false statement\nand this is a uh true false statement and this is the edge the set entry point\nand this is the edge the set entry point\nand this is the edge the set entry point all of this we've covered many times so\nall of this we've covered many times so\nall of this we've covered many times so again should be quite familiar to you\nagain should be quite familiar to you\nagain should be quite familiar to you and last but not least compile the graph\nand last but not least compile the graph\nand last but not least compile the graph and store it in a ragation okay one last\nand store it in a ragation okay one last\nand store it in a ragation okay one last thing though uh I've created\nthing though uh I've created\nthing though uh I've created this function and this function is just\nthis function and this function is just\nthis function and this function is just a function which allows us to keep\na function which allows us to keep\na function which allows us to keep asking questions to our graph and keep\nasking questions to our graph and keep\nasking questions to our graph and keep receiving qu uh answers back and if you\nreceiving qu uh answers back and if you\nreceiving qu uh answers back and if you want to exit we can write either exit or\nwant to exit we can write either exit or\nwant to exit we can write either exit or quit um and it's just a simple while\nquit um and it's just a simple while\nquit um and it's just a simple while loop that's all it is okay and it prints\nloop that's all it is okay and it prints\nloop that's all it is okay and it prints the\nthe\nthe answer okay so that's the actual code\nanswer okay so that's the actual code\nanswer okay so that's the actual code complete now we're going to test it and\ncomplete now we're going to test it and\ncomplete now we're going to test it and see uh if the if this is reliable or\nsee uh if the if this is reliable or\nsee uh if the if this is reliable or not. Okay. Okay. So, let's actually test\nnot. Okay. Okay. So, let's actually test\nnot. Okay. Okay. So, let's actually test this now um by doing python rag agent.\nthis now um by doing python rag agent.\nthis now um by doing python rag agent. py. Let's run this.\npy. Let's run this.\npy. Let's run this. Okay. PDF has been loaded and has nine\nOkay. PDF has been loaded and has nine\nOkay. PDF has been loaded and has nine pages. Created chromo vector data uh\npages. Created chromo vector data uh\npages. Created chromo vector data uh chroma database vector store. So, where\nchroma database vector store. So, where\nchroma database vector store. So, where is this stored? Well, you can see that\nis this stored? Well, you can see that\nis this stored? Well, you can see that this is uh by the way, this will all be\nthis is uh by the way, this will all be\nthis is uh by the way, this will all be on GitHub as well. But this is the\non GitHub as well. But this is the\non GitHub as well. But this is the Chroma database and its respective um\nChroma database and its respective um\nChroma database and its respective um bin bin files. Okay. And we can even\nbin bin files. Okay. And we can even\nbin bin files. Okay. And we can even view it.\nview it.\nview it. But it'll look something like that.\nBut it'll look something like that.\nBut it'll look something like that. Okay. But because this has been created,\nOkay. But because this has been created,\nOkay. But because this has been created, this is a good sign that everything is\nthis is a good sign that everything is\nthis is a good sign that everything is working. Okay. So, let's ask a simple\nworking. Okay. So, let's ask a simple\nworking. Okay. So, let's ask a simple question. Uh let's ask something\nquestion. Uh let's ask something\nquestion. Uh let's ask something like how was the S&amp;P 500\nlike how was the S&amp;P 500\nlike how was the S&amp;P 500 uh performing in 2024? Enter. So it's\nuh performing in 2024? Enter. So it's\nuh performing in 2024? Enter. So it's calling the retriever tool uh with the\ncalling the retriever tool uh with the\ncalling the retriever tool uh with the query this uh its result then puts that\nquery this uh its result then puts that\nquery this uh its result then puts that complete back to the model and the model\ncomplete back to the model and the model\ncomplete back to the model and the model has given us this. In 2024, the S&amp;P 500\nhas given us this. In 2024, the S&amp;P 500\nhas given us this. In 2024, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a total return of this with a\ndelivered a total return of this with a\ndelivered a total return of this with a 23% increase late 1990s and all of that\n23% increase late 1990s and all of that\n23% increase late 1990s and all of that stuff uh magnificent 7 and has given us\nstuff uh magnificent 7 and has given us\nstuff uh magnificent 7 and has given us the uh respective uh citations as well.\nthe uh respective uh citations as well.\nthe uh respective uh citations as well. Now, how can we verify this is uh\nNow, how can we verify this is uh\nNow, how can we verify this is uh correct? Let's\ncorrect? Let's\ncorrect? Let's see. So, notice\nsee. So, notice\nsee. So, notice how if you remember this part, the total\nhow if you remember this part, the total\nhow if you remember this part, the total return of approximately 25%.\nreturn of approximately 25%.\nreturn of approximately 25%. Well, the reason I prom I asked it for\nWell, the reason I prom I asked it for\nWell, the reason I prom I asked it for this is because that's exactly what uh\nthis is because that's exactly what uh\nthis is because that's exactly what uh over here it stated the benchmark\nover here it stated the benchmark\nover here it stated the benchmark roughly at 25% 23%. Uh remember this\nroughly at 25% 23%. Uh remember this\nroughly at 25% 23%. Uh remember this late 1990s part that's exactly what this\nlate 1990s part that's exactly what this\nlate 1990s part that's exactly what this is saying here as well and this was\nis saying here as well and this was\nis saying here as well and this was correctly defined in the first document.\ncorrectly defined in the first document.\ncorrectly defined in the first document. So this is clearly working now right it\nSo this is clearly working now right it\nSo this is clearly working now right it can't have made up this information. So\ncan't have made up this information. So\ncan't have made up this information. So that means our rag is successfully set\nthat means our rag is successfully set\nthat means our rag is successfully set up. Now I can ask as many questions I\nup. Now I can ask as many questions I\nup. Now I can ask as many questions I possib as I want now but now let's see\npossib as I want now but now let's see\npossib as I want now but now let's see if there is something which is not\nif there is something which is not\nif there is something which is not included in the rag. So for example we\nincluded in the rag. So for example we\nincluded in the rag. So for example we can say something like how did open AI\ncan say something like how did open AI\ncan say something like how did open AI perform in\nperform in\nperform in 2024 retrieve a tool called back to the\n2024 retrieve a tool called back to the\n2024 retrieve a tool called back to the model. Okay, now look at this. Uh if I\nmodel. Okay, now look at this. Uh if I\nmodel. Okay, now look at this. Uh if I do it like that, the documents do not\ndo it like that, the documents do not\ndo it like that, the documents do not provide specific information about\nprovide specific information about\nprovide specific information about OpenAI stock performance, which is true\nOpenAI stock performance, which is true\nOpenAI stock performance, which is true cuz OpenAI is not a publicly traded\ncuz OpenAI is not a publicly traded\ncuz OpenAI is not a publicly traded company. Uh and yeah, it got that\ncompany. Uh and yeah, it got that\ncompany. Uh and yeah, it got that correct. So no hallucination there. So\ncorrect. So no hallucination there. So\ncorrect. So no hallucination there. So you can clearly see that this is working\nyou can clearly see that this is working\nyou can clearly see that this is working uh completely fine. And that ladies and\nuh completely fine. And that ladies and\nuh completely fine. And that ladies and gentlemen is how you create a retrieval\ngentlemen is how you create a retrieval\ngentlemen is how you create a retrieval augmented generation graph in Langraph.\naugmented generation graph in Langraph.\naugmented generation graph in Langraph. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Awesome. All right people. So that\nAwesome. All right people. So that\nAwesome. All right people. So that brings us to the end of this course and\nbrings us to the end of this course and\nbrings us to the end of this course and I hope you liked it and I hope you\nI hope you liked it and I hope you\nI hope you liked it and I hope you learned a lot about\nlearned a lot about\nlearned a lot about Langraph.

If you're looking to push something into\nlooking to push something into\nlooking to push something into production, you want to have scalability\nproduction, you want to have scalability\nproduction, you want to have scalability features, and overall you just want more\nfeatures, and overall you just want more\nfeatures, and overall you just want more control, then Langraph is what you\ncontrol, then Langraph is what you\ncontrol, then Langraph is what you should be using. But it can be difficult\nshould be using. But it can be difficult\nshould be using. But it can be difficult to learn. So that's why I'm making this\nto learn. So that's why I'm making this\nto learn. So that's why I'm making this video. I'm going to break it down for\nvideo. I'm going to break it down for\nvideo. I'm going to break it down for you as simple as possible. And by the\nyou as simple as possible. And by the\nyou as simple as possible. And by the end of this, you'll know how to build AI\nend of this, you'll know how to build AI\nend of this, you'll know how to build AI agents and you'll have a more complex\nagents and you'll have a more complex\nagents and you'll have a more complex one that you can adapt and change to\none that you can adapt and change to\none that you can adapt and change to your use case. Now, what we're going to\nyour use case. Now, what we're going to\nyour use case. Now, what we're going to do here is just quickly discuss the key\ndo here is just quickly discuss the key\ndo here is just quickly discuss the key differences between Langraph and\ndifferences between Langraph and\ndifferences between Langraph and something like Langchain. Then, we're\nsomething like Langchain. Then, we're\nsomething like Langchain. Then, we're going to hop onto the computer. So,\ngoing to hop onto the computer. So,\ngoing to hop onto the computer. So, let's go ahead and do that. All right.\nlet's go ahead and do that. All right.\nlet's go ahead and do that. All right. So, let's scroll down here and just look\nSo, let's scroll down here and just look\nSo, let's scroll down here and just look at some stuff that they have on their\nat some stuff that they have on their\nat some stuff that they have on their website. So, Langraph really is meant\nwebsite. So, Langraph really is meant\nwebsite. So, Langraph really is meant for when you want to have a more complex\nfor when you want to have a more complex\nfor when you want to have a more complex application. It really is an\napplication. It really is an\napplication. It really is an orchestration framework. That means that\norchestration framework. That means that\norchestration framework. That means that it allows you to control the flow and\nit allows you to control the flow and\nit allows you to control the flow and kind of how your AI agent uses various\nkind of how your AI agent uses various\nkind of how your AI agent uses various state or passes through various stages.\nstate or passes through various stages.\nstate or passes through various stages. If you're not familiar, there are\nIf you're not familiar, there are\nIf you're not familiar, there are modules like Langchain. Langchain is\nmodules like Langchain.

Langchain is kind of a simpler, higher level\nkind of a simpler, higher level\nkind of a simpler, higher level framework that makes it easy to build\nframework that makes it easy to build\nframework that makes it easy to build simple AI agents, but when you have a\nsimple AI agents, but when you have a\nsimple AI agents, but when you have a lot of state or you have a lot of steps,\nlot of state or you have a lot of steps,\nlot of state or you have a lot of steps, it can be difficult to orchestrate that\nit can be difficult to orchestrate that\nit can be difficult to orchestrate that agent because it doesn't have those\nagent because it doesn't have those\nagent because it doesn't have those lower level features. So lang chain\nlower level features. So lang chain\nlower level features. So lang chain really just gives you much more control.\nreally just gives you much more control.\nreally just gives you much more control. It also is much better at persisting\nIt also is much better at persisting\nIt also is much better at persisting things like the context. So as you can\nthings like the context.

So it knows kind\nlong-term interactions. So it knows kind\nlong-term interactions. So it knows kind of the information that you've given to\nof the information that you've given to\nof the information that you've given to it. And you can update and modify the\nit.

Now, as it says, lang\ndifferent steps. Now, as it says, lang\ndifferent steps. Now, as it says, lang graph uses a graph to represent data and\ngraph uses a graph to represent data and\ngraph uses a graph to represent data and to represent kind of the state of an\nto represent kind of the state of an\nto represent kind of the state of an agent. I'm going to show you that in\nagent. I'm going to show you that in\nagent. I'm going to show you that in just one second, but those are the main\njust one second, but those are the main\njust one second, but those are the main kind of key features. Now, of course,\nkind of key features. Now, of course,\nkind of key features. Now, of course, there are also advantages here when it\nthere are also advantages here when it\nthere are also advantages here when it comes to things like scalability and\ncomes to things like scalability and\ncomes to things like scalability and fault tolerance. We're not really going\nfault tolerance. We're not really going\nfault tolerance. We're not really going to get into that in this video, but\nto get into that in this video, but\nto get into that in this video, but Langraph also has kind of this cloud\nLangraph also has kind of this cloud\nLangraph also has kind of this cloud platform that you can pay for that would\nplatform that you can pay for that would\nplatform that you can pay for that would allow you to deploy your Langraph\nallow you to deploy your Langraph\nallow you to deploy your Langraph applications. Again, we're not doing\napplications. Again, we're not doing\napplications. Again, we're not doing that in this video, but it is worth\nthat in this video, but it is worth\nthat in this video, but it is worth noting because that's kind of a huge\nnoting because that's kind of a huge\nnoting because that's kind of a huge selling point of using something like\nselling point of using something like\nselling point of using something like Langraph. Okay, so those are the main\nLangraph. Okay, so those are the main\nLangraph. Okay, so those are the main features. Now, what I want to do is I\nfeatures. Now, what I want to do is I\nfeatures. Now, what I want to do is I want to show you an example of a graph\nwant to show you an example of a graph\nwant to show you an example of a graph that you could generate with Langraph.\nthat you could generate with Langraph.\nthat you could generate with Langraph. So have a look at these graphs here. On\nSo have a look at these graphs here. On\nSo have a look at these graphs here. On the right side, we have a very simple\nthe right side, we have a very simple\nthe right side, we have a very simple one. On the left side, we have one\none. On the left side, we have one\none. On the left side, we have one that's a little bit more complicated.\nthat's a little bit more complicated.\nthat's a little bit more complicated. Now, we're actually going to build both\nNow, we're actually going to build both\nNow, we're actually going to build both of these graphs. And these graphs will\nof these graphs. And these graphs will\nof these graphs. And these graphs will represent an agentic system or an AI\nrepresent an agentic system or an AI\nrepresent an agentic system or an AI agent. So, if you look at the right hand\nagent. So, if you look at the right hand\nagent. So, if you look at the right hand side here where we have start, chatbot,\nside here where we have start, chatbot,\nside here where we have start, chatbot, and then end. This is a super simple\nand then end. This is a super simple\nand then end. This is a super simple agent flow and something that you've\nagent flow and something that you've\nagent flow and something that you've probably built before without using\nprobably built before without using\nprobably built before without using something like Langraph. Now, all this\nsomething like Langraph. Now, all this\nsomething like Langraph. Now, all this means is we start at this particular\nmeans is we start at this particular\nmeans is we start at this particular node. Maybe we collect something like\nnode. Maybe we collect something like\nnode. Maybe we collect something like some user input. We then throw that to a\nsome user input. We then throw that to a\nsome user input. We then throw that to a chatbot and maybe the chatbot gives us\nchatbot and maybe the chatbot gives us\nchatbot and maybe the chatbot gives us some output and then we end. Okay, very\nsome output and then we end. Okay, very\nsome output and then we end. Okay, very very simple graph. Now on the left side\nvery simple graph. Now on the left side\nvery simple graph. Now on the left side we start to get a little bit more\nwe start to get a little bit more\nwe start to get a little bit more complicated. Still simple but you can\ncomplicated. Still simple but you can\ncomplicated. Still simple but you can see where Lang graph starts to have an\nsee where Lang graph starts to have an\nsee where Lang graph starts to have an advantage here. We now have some\nadvantage here. We now have some\nadvantage here. We now have some orchestration and we kind of have a flow\norchestration and we kind of have a flow\norchestration and we kind of have a flow between our application. So we have some\nbetween our application. So we have some\nbetween our application. So we have some start node. Maybe we collect some user\nstart node. Maybe we collect some user\nstart node. Maybe we collect some user input. In this case the user input can\ninput. In this case the user input can\ninput. In this case the user input can be maybe a problem that a user is\nbe maybe a problem that a user is\nbe maybe a problem that a user is having. We then classify that input. We\nhaving. We then classify that input. We\nhaving. We then classify that input. We pass that to a router based on that\npass that to a router based on that\npass that to a router based on that classification whether it's something\nclassification whether it's something\nclassification whether it's something that maybe a therapist should handle or\nthat maybe a therapist should handle or\nthat maybe a therapist should handle or something that like a more logical\nsomething that like a more logical\nsomething that like a more logical thinker should handle. We then route\nthinker should handle. We then route\nthinker should handle. We then route that request to one of these two nodes.\nthat request to one of these two nodes.\nthat request to one of these two nodes. So this logical node or this therapist\nSo this logical node or this therapist\nSo this logical node or this therapist node and then we end from there. Okay.\nnode and then we end from there. Okay.\nnode and then we end from there. Okay. So in langraph we have nodes which are\nSo in langraph we have nodes which are\nSo in langraph we have nodes which are all of these things you're seeing. So\nall of these things you're seeing. So\nall of these things you're seeing. So like start classifier router these are\nlike start classifier router these are\nlike start classifier router these are all nodes. And then we have edges those\nall nodes. And then we have edges those\nall nodes. And then we have edges those are the connections between those nodes.\nare the connections between those nodes.\nare the connections between those nodes. And we can have things like conditional\nAnd we can have things like conditional\nAnd we can have things like conditional edges which you can see here in our\nedges which you can see here in our\nedges which you can see here in our router where we can either go to the\nrouter where we can either go to the\nrouter where we can either go to the therapist or to the logical. Okay, so\ntherapist or to the logical. Okay, so\ntherapist or to the logical. Okay, so that's kind of how Langraph works.\nthat's kind of how Langraph works.\nthat's kind of how Langraph works. That's how we orchestrate the flow of\nThat's how we orchestrate the flow of\nThat's how we orchestrate the flow of the agent and allows us to build these\nthe agent and allows us to build these\nthe agent and allows us to build these really small components that we can\nreally small components that we can\nreally small components that we can combine together to make these large\ncombine together to make these large\ncombine together to make these large agentic systems and that allows us to\nagentic systems and that allows us to\nagentic systems and that allows us to have multiple agents that are\nhave multiple agents that are\nhave multiple agents that are interacting with each other and to do\ninteracting with each other and to do\ninteracting with each other and to do some really cool stuff. Obviously, in\nsome really cool stuff. Obviously, in\nsome really cool stuff. Obviously, in this video, we can't cover everything,\nthis video, we can't cover everything,\nthis video, we can't cover everything, but you're going to see how we make a\nbut you're going to see how we make a\nbut you're going to see how we make a super simple one and then how we get a\nsuper simple one and then how we get a\nsuper simple one and then how we get a little bit more complex and really take\nlittle bit more complex and really take\nlittle bit more complex and really take advantage of the graph component of\nadvantage of the graph component of\nadvantage of the graph component of Langflow. Okay, so now let's hop over to\nLangflow. Okay, so now let's hop over to\nLangflow. Okay, so now let's hop over to our IDE. Let's start coding and let's\nour IDE. Let's start coding and let's\nour IDE. Let's start coding and let's actually get into it cuz I know this is\nactually get into it cuz I know this is\nactually get into it cuz I know this is going to make a lot more sense to you\ngoing to make a lot more sense to you\ngoing to make a lot more sense to you guys once we really jump into the code.\nguys once we really jump into the code.\nguys once we really jump into the code. Now, right now I am using PyCharm. Okay,\nNow, right now I am using PyCharm. Okay,\nNow, right now I am using PyCharm. Okay, a lot of people ask me why I use this.\na lot of people ask me why I use this.\na lot of people ask me why I use this. Well, PyCharm really just is the best\nWell, PyCharm really just is the best\nWell, PyCharm really just is the best IDE when it comes to professional Python\nIDE when it comes to professional Python\nIDE when it comes to professional Python development. PyCharm does have a free\ndevelopment. PyCharm does have a free\ndevelopment. PyCharm does have a free subscription, but I also have a link in\nsubscription, but I also have a link in\nsubscription, but I also have a link in the description where you can get a\nthe description where you can get a\nthe description where you can get a threemonth extended free trial of their\nthreemonth extended free trial of their\nthreemonth extended free trial of their Pro subscription because I have a\nPro subscription because I have a\nPro subscription because I have a long-term partnership with them. So,\nlong-term partnership with them. So,\nlong-term partnership with them. So, make sure to check that out from the\nmake sure to check that out from the\nmake sure to check that out from the link below. And you'll see in this video\nlink below. And you'll see in this video\nlink below. And you'll see in this video why I do choose to use PyCharm because\nwhy I do choose to use PyCharm because\nwhy I do choose to use PyCharm because the autocomplete is just better, the\nthe autocomplete is just better, the\nthe autocomplete is just better, the environment management, all of that kind\nenvironment management, all of that kind\nenvironment management, all of that kind of stuff. It's really just a go-to IDE\nof stuff. It's really just a go-to IDE\nof stuff. It's really just a go-to IDE if you're doing a lot of heavy Python\nif you're doing a lot of heavy Python\nif you're doing a lot of heavy Python coding. Anyways, with that in mind,\ncoding. Anyways, with that in mind,\ncoding. Anyways, with that in mind, let's start creating a few things and\nlet's start creating a few things and\nlet's start creating a few things and getting our uh project set up. So, what\ngetting our uh project set up. So, what\ngetting our uh project set up. So, what we're going to do is open up our\nwe're going to do is open up our\nwe're going to do is open up our terminal and we're going to start\nterminal and we're going to start\nterminal and we're going to start dealing with our dependencies. Now,\ndealing with our dependencies. Now,\ndealing with our dependencies. Now, since we're in PyCharm, we can use\nsince we're in PyCharm, we can use\nsince we're in PyCharm, we can use something like uh virtual environment\nsomething like uh virtual environment\nsomething like uh virtual environment and we can just create it manually. But\nand we can just create it manually. But\nand we can just create it manually. But recently, I've been using UV a lot. So,\nrecently, I've been using UV a lot. So,\nrecently, I've been using UV a lot. So, I'm going to use UV and show you how\nI'm going to use UV and show you how\nI'm going to use UV and show you how that works in terms of kind of enabling\nthat works in terms of kind of enabling\nthat works in terms of kind of enabling the dependencies for this project. Now,\nthe dependencies for this project. Now,\nthe dependencies for this project. Now, if you're unfamiliar with UV, this is a\nif you're unfamiliar with UV, this is a\nif you're unfamiliar with UV, this is a new package manager for Python. I'm just\nnew package manager for Python. I'm just\nnew package manager for Python. I'm just going to look it up right here so you\ngoing to look it up right here so you\ngoing to look it up right here so you guys can see it. So, go UV right here.\nguys can see it. So, go UV right here.\nguys can see it. So, go UV right here. Okay, I'll leave a link to this in the\nOkay, I'll leave a link to this in the\nOkay, I'll leave a link to this in the description. You can install it very\ndescription. You can install it very\ndescription. You can install it very easily. You actually install it using\neasily. You actually install it using\neasily. You actually install it using pip, which is kind of funny. Once you\npip, which is kind of funny. Once you\npip, which is kind of funny. Once you have it installed, you should be able to\nhave it installed, you should be able to\nhave it installed, you should be able to just follow along with me here and type\njust follow along with me here and type\njust follow along with me here and type in the relevant UV commands. I also have\nin the relevant UV commands. I also have\nin the relevant UV commands. I also have a video I'll leave on screen that shows\na video I'll leave on screen that shows\na video I'll leave on screen that shows you how to use UV. Okay, so let's assume\nyou how to use UV. Okay, so let's assume\nyou how to use UV. Okay, so let's assume you have UV installed on your system.\nyou have UV installed on your system.\nyou have UV installed on your system. What we're going to do is we're going to\nWhat we're going to do is we're going to\nWhat we're going to do is we're going to open up a new folder. So I've done that\nopen up a new folder. So I've done that\nopen up a new folder. So I've done that inside of my IDE here and we're going to\ninside of my IDE here and we're going to\ninside of my IDE here and we're going to initialize a new UV project. To do that,\ninitialize a new UV project. To do that,\ninitialize a new UV project. To do that, I'm going to type UV init and then dot.\nI'm going to type UV init and then dot.\nI'm going to type UV init and then dot. This just means initialize in the\nThis just means initialize in the\nThis just means initialize in the current directory. So you can see it's\ncurrent directory. So you can see it's\ncurrent directory. So you can see it's now initialized a new project. And if we\nnow initialized a new project. And if we\nnow initialized a new project. And if we open this up here, you see that we have\nopen this up here, you see that we have\nopen this up here, you see that we have our Python version, pi project.toml,\nour Python version, pi project.toml,\nour Python version, pi project.toml, main.py file, all of that kind of stuff.\nmain.py file, all of that kind of stuff.\nmain.py file, all of that kind of stuff. From here, we're going to install the\nFrom here, we're going to install the\nFrom here, we're going to install the various dependencies that we need. So in\nvarious dependencies that we need. So in\nvarious dependencies that we need. So in order to do that, we can just type uv\norder to do that, we can just type uv\norder to do that, we can just type uv add. And then the first one we're going\nadd. And then the first one we're going\nadd. And then the first one we're going to bring in is python and then env. This\nto bring in is python and then env. This\nto bring in is python and then env. This is for loading environment variables.\nis for loading environment variables.\nis for loading environment variables. After that, we're going to type a few\nAfter that, we're going to type a few\nAfter that, we're going to type a few more that we need. We are going to bring\nmore that we need. We are going to bring\nmore that we need. We are going to bring in lang. Okay, graph like that. We\nin lang. Okay, graph like that. We\nin lang. Okay, graph like that. We should spell lang graph correctly. Of\nshould spell lang graph correctly. Of\nshould spell lang graph correctly. Of course, we're also going to bring in\ncourse, we're also going to bring in\ncourse, we're also going to bring in lang chain and then in square brackets.\nlang chain and then in square brackets.\nlang chain and then in square brackets. This is going to be anthropic. Okay, so\nThis is going to be anthropic. Okay, so\nThis is going to be anthropic. Okay, so anthropic like that. And I believe we do\nanthropic like that. And I believe we do\nanthropic like that. And I believe we do need to put this in quotation marks\nneed to put this in quotation marks\nneed to put this in quotation marks because we're using the square brackets.\nbecause we're using the square brackets.\nbecause we're using the square brackets. Okay, so we're going to have python.nv\nOkay, so we're going to have python.nv\nOkay, so we're going to have python.nv langraph and then lang\nlangraph and then lang\nlangraph and then lang chainropic. Did I spell anthropic\nchainropic. Did I spell anthropic\nchainropic. Did I spell anthropic correctly? Let's make sure that we are\ncorrectly? Let's make sure that we are\ncorrectly? Let's make sure that we are good there. And after that we are going\ngood there. And after that we are going\ngood there. And after that we are going to bring in last one here which is I pi\nto bring in last one here which is I pi\nto bring in last one here which is I pi kernel which we'll use later on for\nkernel which we'll use later on for\nkernel which we'll use later on for actually creating something like a\nactually creating something like a\nactually creating something like a Jupyter notebook. So we're going to go\nJupyter notebook. So we're going to go\nJupyter notebook. So we're going to go ahead and press enter here. It's going\nahead and press enter here. It's going\nahead and press enter here. It's going to create the environment for us and add\nto create the environment for us and add\nto create the environment for us and add all of those dependencies. And we should\nall of those dependencies. And we should\nall of those dependencies. And we should pretty much be good to go. And if we\npretty much be good to go. And if we\npretty much be good to go. And if we look at our pi projectl file we can see\nlook at our pi projectl file we can see\nlook at our pi projectl file we can see that we have the dependencies showing up\nthat we have the dependencies showing up\nthat we have the dependencies showing up here. Okay. So that's all we need for\nhere. Okay. So that's all we need for\nhere. Okay. So that's all we need for now. After this what I'm going to do is\nnow. After this what I'm going to do is\nnow. After this what I'm going to do is open up my main.py file. I'm going to\nopen up my main.py file. I'm going to\nopen up my main.py file. I'm going to delete everything inside of here. Now,\ndelete everything inside of here. Now,\ndelete everything inside of here. Now, after the main.py file has been created,\nafter the main.py file has been created,\nafter the main.py file has been created, we're going to go ahead and make one\nwe're going to go ahead and make one\nwe're going to go ahead and make one more new file. This file is going to be\nmore new file. This file is going to be\nmore new file. This file is going to be aenv file. Okay, just go ahead and press\naenv file. Okay, just go ahead and press\naenv file. Okay, just go ahead and press add there. That's fine. The env file is\nadd there. That's fine. The env file is\nadd there. That's fine. The env file is going to store an environment variable\ngoing to store an environment variable\ngoing to store an environment variable that will allow us to kind of store the\nthat will allow us to kind of store the\nthat will allow us to kind of store the key for whatever LLM it is that we're\nkey for whatever LLM it is that we're\nkey for whatever LLM it is that we're going to use. Now, we can use any LLM\ngoing to use. Now, we can use any LLM\ngoing to use. Now, we can use any LLM that we want here. In this case, I'm\nthat we want here. In this case, I'm\nthat we want here. In this case, I'm going to use Claude or I'm going to use\ngoing to use Claude or I'm going to use\ngoing to use Claude or I'm going to use entropic. Again, kind of pick whatever\nentropic. Again, kind of pick whatever\nentropic. Again, kind of pick whatever you want. You could use OpenAI. You\nyou want. You could use OpenAI. You\nyou want. You could use OpenAI. You could use a llama if you wanted to do\ncould use a llama if you wanted to do\ncould use a llama if you wanted to do this locally, but I find that claude\nthis locally, but I find that claude\nthis locally, but I find that claude works pretty well here. So that's the\nworks pretty well here. So that's the\nworks pretty well here. So that's the one that I'm going to go with. So inside\none that I'm going to go with. So inside\none that I'm going to go with. So inside of this file, all I'm going to do is\nof this file, all I'm going to do is\nof this file, all I'm going to do is just write an environment variable. So\njust write an environment variable. So\njust write an environment variable. So to do that, we're going to say,\nto do that, we're going to say,\nto do that, we're going to say, actually, let me just copy it in here so\nactually, let me just copy it in here so\nactually, let me just copy it in here so that I don't mess it up. We're going to\nthat I don't mess it up. We're going to\nthat I don't mess it up. We're going to have entropic API_key is equal to and\nhave entropic API_key is equal to and\nhave entropic API_key is equal to and then we're going to paste in our API\nthen we're going to paste in our API\nthen we're going to paste in our API key. Now, in order to get our API key,\nkey. Now, in order to get our API key,\nkey. Now, in order to get our API key, we're going to have to go to the\nwe're going to have to go to the\nwe're going to have to go to the entropic console. So we're going to go\nentropic console. So we're going to go\nentropic console. So we're going to go to console.entropic.com/\nto console.entropic.com/\nto console.entropic.com/ ontropic.com/dashboard. Okay, we're then\nontropic.com/dashboard. Okay, we're then\nontropic.com/dashboard. Okay, we're then going to go to API keys here. You will\ngoing to go to API keys here. You will\ngoing to go to API keys here. You will need an account on this and I believe\nneed an account on this and I believe\nneed an account on this and I believe you will need a credit card, although it\nyou will need a credit card, although it\nyou will need a credit card, although it should only cost you like a few cents.\nshould only cost you like a few cents.\nshould only cost you like a few cents. You can see here like one of these cost\nYou can see here like one of these cost\nYou can see here like one of these cost me 43 cents. These I don't think have\nme 43 cents. These I don't think have\nme 43 cents. These I don't think have cost me anything so far. And then I'm\ncost me anything so far. And then I'm\ncost me anything so far. And then I'm going to make a new API key. I am just\ngoing to make a new API key. I am just\ngoing to make a new API key. I am just going to call this lang graph like that.\ngoing to call this lang graph like that.\ngoing to call this lang graph like that. I'm going to go add and then I'm going\nI'm going to go add and then I'm going\nI'm going to go add and then I'm going to copy this key and delete it later so\nto copy this key and delete it later so\nto copy this key and delete it later so that you guys don't see it. Obviously,\nthat you guys don't see it. Obviously,\nthat you guys don't see it. Obviously, don't leak this with anyone. And then\ndon't leak this with anyone. And then\ndon't leak this with anyone. And then I'm going to paste it right here. Okay,\nI'm going to paste it right here. Okay,\nI'm going to paste it right here. Okay, so we have our API key now inside of\nso we have our API key now inside of\nso we have our API key now inside of this env file. Again, you're going to\nthis env file. Again, you're going to\nthis env file. Again, you're going to need to copy this step for whatever LLM\nneed to copy this step for whatever LLM\nneed to copy this step for whatever LLM provider you use. And if you just want\nprovider you use. And if you just want\nprovider you use. And if you just want to follow along with this video, then of\nto follow along with this video, then of\nto follow along with this video, then of course the easiest will be to use\ncourse the easiest will be to use\ncourse the easiest will be to use Entropic. And that's the one that I\nEntropic. And that's the one that I\nEntropic. And that's the one that I installed. Okay, so now that we have the\ninstalled. Okay, so now that we have the\ninstalled. Okay, so now that we have the key, we have everything installed, we\nkey, we have everything installed, we\nkey, we have everything installed, we can actually start writing some code. So\ncan actually start writing some code. So\ncan actually start writing some code. So from our main.py file here, the first\nfrom our main.py file here, the first\nfrom our main.py file here, the first thing we're going to do is we're going\nthing we're going to do is we're going\nthing we're going to do is we're going to say\nto say\nto say from.env import load.env. We're then\nfrom.env import load.env. We're then\nfrom.env import load.env. We're then going to call the load.env function. And\ngoing to call the load.env function. And\ngoing to call the load.env function. And what this is going to do for us is load\nwhat this is going to do for us is load\nwhat this is going to do for us is load in this environment variable so it can\nin this environment variable so it can\nin this environment variable so it can then be used when we initialize our\nthen be used when we initialize our\nthen be used when we initialize our model. So again just to be clear here we\nmodel. So again just to be clear here we\nmodel. So again just to be clear here we need an LLM and the LLM will kind of\nneed an LLM and the LLM will kind of\nneed an LLM and the LLM will kind of control the agent or be the brain of the\ncontrol the agent or be the brain of the\ncontrol the agent or be the brain of the agent. But around that LLM we can wrap a\nagent. But around that LLM we can wrap a\nagent. But around that LLM we can wrap a bunch of functionality. We can build\nbunch of functionality. We can build\nbunch of functionality. We can build this graph. We can have these multi-\nthis graph. We can have these multi-\nthis graph. We can have these multi- aent systems which is what Lang graph\naent systems which is what Lang graph\naent systems which is what Lang graph allows us to do. Okay. So now that we've\nallows us to do. Okay. So now that we've\nallows us to do. Okay. So now that we've done that uh what we're going to do is\ndone that uh what we're going to do is\ndone that uh what we're going to do is bring in a few things. So we're going to\nbring in a few things. So we're going to\nbring in a few things. So we're going to say from typing import\nsay from typing import\nsay from typing import annotated and literal. Okay, we're going\nannotated and literal. Okay, we're going\nannotated and literal. Okay, we're going to say\nto say\nto say from lang graph dot and this is going to\nfrom lang graph dot and this is going to\nfrom lang graph dot and this is going to be graph and we are going to import the\nbe graph and we are going to import the\nbe graph and we are going to import the state graph. Okay. And we're going to\nstate graph. Okay. And we're going to\nstate graph. Okay. And we're going to import start in all capitals and end in\nimport start in all capitals and end in\nimport start in all capitals and end in all capitals. Sorry for the cut there,\nall capitals. Sorry for the cut there,\nall capitals. Sorry for the cut there, but I just fixed my interpreter\nbut I just fixed my interpreter\nbut I just fixed my interpreter settings. So now we're not getting any\nsettings. So now we're not getting any\nsettings. So now we're not getting any of those autocomplete issues. I did that\nof those autocomplete issues. I did that\nof those autocomplete issues. I did that in PyCharm just by pressing this button\nin PyCharm just by pressing this button\nin PyCharm just by pressing this button and selecting the existing interpreter\nand selecting the existing interpreter\nand selecting the existing interpreter that's inside of this. Venv folder.\nthat's inside of this. Venv folder.\nthat's inside of this. Venv folder. Okay. So now that we've done that, we\nOkay. So now that we've done that, we\nOkay. So now that we've done that, we have a few more imports that we need\nhave a few more imports that we need\nhave a few more imports that we need here. So we're going to say from\nhere. So we're going to say from\nhere. So we're going to say from langraph and then this is going to\nlangraph and then this is going to\nlangraph and then this is going to begraph message. We are going to import\nbegraph message. We are going to import\nbegraph message. We are going to import this function called add messages. We're\nthis function called add messages. We're\nthis function called add messages. We're then going to say from this is going to\nthen going to say from this is going to\nthen going to say from this is going to be lang chain this time. Okay, not\nbe lang chain this time. Okay, not\nbe lang chain this time. Okay, not langraph. So we're going to say from\nlangraph. So we're going to say from\nlangraph. So we're going to say from langchain\nlangchain\nlangchain chat_models and we're going to import\nchat_models and we're going to import\nchat_models and we're going to import the init chat model. Then we're going to\nthe init chat model. Then we're going to\nthe init chat model. Then we're going to say from paidantic we're going to import\nsay from paidantic we're going to import\nsay from paidantic we're going to import the base model and we're also going to\nthe base model and we're also going to\nthe base model and we're also going to import the field. We'll use this later\nimport the field. We'll use this later\nimport the field. We'll use this later on. And then lastly we're going to say\non. And then lastly we're going to say\non. And then lastly we're going to say from typing extensions we are going to\nfrom typing extensions we are going to\nfrom typing extensions we are going to import the typed dictionary. Okay. So\nimport the typed dictionary. Okay. So\nimport the typed dictionary. Okay. So that's all of the imports that we need.\nthat's all of the imports that we need.\nthat's all of the imports that we need. Now that we've done that, we're going to\nNow that we've done that, we're going to\nNow that we've done that, we're going to load in our LLM. Okay, so we're going to\nload in our LLM. Okay, so we're going to\nload in our LLM. Okay, so we're going to say llm is equal to init chat model. And\nsay llm is equal to init chat model. And\nsay llm is equal to init chat model. And then inside of here, we're going to\nthen inside of here, we're going to\nthen inside of here, we're going to specify the model we want to load. So\nspecify the model we want to load. So\nspecify the model we want to load. So I'm just going to copy this in so that I\nI'm just going to copy this in so that I\nI'm just going to copy this in so that I don't make a mistake. And keep in mind\ndon't make a mistake. And keep in mind\ndon't make a mistake. And keep in mind all of this code will be available from\nall of this code will be available from\nall of this code will be available from the link in the description. So you will\nthe link in the description. So you will\nthe link in the description. So you will be able to just copy this if you need\nbe able to just copy this if you need\nbe able to just copy this if you need to. So you can see here that I'm just\nto. So you can see here that I'm just\nto. So you can see here that I'm just loading in the clawed 3.5 sonnet latest.\nloading in the clawed 3.5 sonnet latest.\nloading in the clawed 3.5 sonnet latest. Okay, you can put any model name you\nOkay, you can put any model name you\nOkay, you can put any model name you want here, but in this case, we're\nwant here, but in this case, we're\nwant here, but in this case, we're loading the entropic one. And because we\nloading the entropic one. And because we\nloading the entropic one. And because we have this environment variable in our\nhave this environment variable in our\nhave this environment variable in our enenv file and we've loaded that in with\nenenv file and we've loaded that in with\nenenv file and we've loaded that in with loadenv. Oops, that's not what I meant\nloadenv. Oops, that's not what I meant\nloadenv. Oops, that's not what I meant to do. Uh, this is going to load\nto do. Uh, this is going to load\nto do. Uh, this is going to load properly and allow us to access claude\nproperly and allow us to access claude\nproperly and allow us to access claude and use our API key. Okay. And there's\nand use our API key. Okay. And there's\nand use our API key. Okay. And there's other models you can use here. Again,\nother models you can use here. Again,\nother models you can use here. Again, you can use GPT, you can use DeepSeek.\nyou can use GPT, you can use DeepSeek.\nyou can use GPT, you can use DeepSeek. There's all kinds of ones. You will have\nThere's all kinds of ones. You will have\nThere's all kinds of ones. You will have to look that up or maybe ask an AI tool\nto look that up or maybe ask an AI tool\nto look that up or maybe ask an AI tool to assist you. But it's relatively easy\nto assist you. But it's relatively easy\nto assist you. But it's relatively easy to swap the LLM in the example that I'm\nto swap the LLM in the example that I'm\nto swap the LLM in the example that I'm showing you. Okay. Okay, so now that we\nshowing you. Okay. Okay, so now that we\nshowing you. Okay. Okay, so now that we have the LLM, the next thing that we\nhave the LLM, the next thing that we\nhave the LLM, the next thing that we want to do is we want to start setting\nwant to do is we want to start setting\nwant to do is we want to start setting up this state for our graph. Now, I know\nup this state for our graph. Now, I know\nup this state for our graph. Now, I know some of this will seem confusing right\nsome of this will seem confusing right\nsome of this will seem confusing right now. Just bear with me and I promise I'm\nnow. Just bear with me and I promise I'm\nnow. Just bear with me and I promise I'm going to break it down, but there is a\ngoing to break it down, but there is a\ngoing to break it down, but there is a bit of code that we need before we can\nbit of code that we need before we can\nbit of code that we need before we can really get going here. So, we're going\nreally get going here. So, we're going\nreally get going here. So, we're going to make a class and we're going to call\nto make a class and we're going to call\nto make a class and we're going to call this state. Now, inside of here, we're\nthis state. Now, inside of here, we're\nthis state. Now, inside of here, we're going to have a typed dictionary. Okay,\ngoing to have a typed dictionary. Okay,\ngoing to have a typed dictionary. Okay, that's going to be the type or the\nthat's going to be the type or the\nthat's going to be the type or the inheritance for our class. And this is\ninheritance for our class. And this is\ninheritance for our class. And this is where we're going to specify the state\nwhere we're going to specify the state\nwhere we're going to specify the state that we want our model and our agent\nthat we want our model and our agent\nthat we want our model and our agent system to have access to. And this is\nsystem to have access to. And this is\nsystem to have access to. And this is going to kind of control the flow of our\ngoing to kind of control the flow of our\ngoing to kind of control the flow of our application. So for right now, we're\napplication. So for right now, we're\napplication. So for right now, we're going to keep it nice and simple. And\ngoing to keep it nice and simple. And\ngoing to keep it nice and simple. And we're going to say messages. And then\nwe're going to say messages. And then\nwe're going to say messages. And then this is going to be annotated. And then\nthis is going to be annotated. And then\nthis is going to be annotated. And then we're going to have list and then add\nwe're going to have list and then add\nwe're going to have list and then add underscore messages. Okay. Okay. Now,\nunderscore messages. Okay. Okay. Now,\nunderscore messages. Okay. Okay. Now, what this is doing is we're saying that\nwhat this is doing is we're saying that\nwhat this is doing is we're saying that messages is going to be of type list.\nmessages is going to be of type list.\nmessages is going to be of type list. And whenever we want to change the\nAnd whenever we want to change the\nAnd whenever we want to change the messages, we're going to use this\nmessages, we're going to use this\nmessages, we're going to use this function called add messages which is\nfunction called add messages which is\nfunction called add messages which is provided by langraph to essentially add\nprovided by langraph to essentially add\nprovided by langraph to essentially add a new message to this list. I know that\na new message to this list. I know that\na new message to this list. I know that this seems a little bit weird, but this\nthis seems a little bit weird, but this\nthis seems a little bit weird, but this is just how you do this for storing\nis just how you do this for storing\nis just how you do this for storing messages. And in our state, what we're\nmessages. And in our state, what we're\nmessages. And in our state, what we're going to be doing is just keeping track\ngoing to be doing is just keeping track\ngoing to be doing is just keeping track of all of the messages that have been\nof all of the messages that have been\nof all of the messages that have been said. So the message that we say, for\nsaid. So the message that we say, for\nsaid. So the message that we say, for example, like a user message, and then\nexample, like a user message, and then\nexample, like a user message, and then the message that the LLM gives us back.\nthe message that the LLM gives us back.\nthe message that the LLM gives us back. So something like the assistant message.\nSo something like the assistant message.\nSo something like the assistant message. Okay, so this is like the most simple\nOkay, so this is like the most simple\nOkay, so this is like the most simple state that you can set up. And again,\nstate that you can set up. And again,\nstate that you can set up. And again, when we use annotated here, I mean, you\nwhen we use annotated here, I mean, you\nwhen we use annotated here, I mean, you can read this if you want. It kind of\ncan read this if you want. It kind of\ncan read this if you want. It kind of explains first we're putting the type\nexplains first we're putting the type\nexplains first we're putting the type and then second we're putting how we\nand then second we're putting how we\nand then second we're putting how we want to modify this type. Okay, so\nwant to modify this type. Okay, so\nwant to modify this type. Okay, so that's our state. All right, so we have\nthat's our state. All right, so we have\nthat's our state. All right, so we have the state and later on I'm going to show\nthe state and later on I'm going to show\nthe state and later on I'm going to show you an example where we put some other\nyou an example where we put some other\nyou an example where we put some other things in the state, but for now it's\nthings in the state, but for now it's\nthings in the state, but for now it's just going to store the messages. Now\njust going to store the messages. Now\njust going to store the messages. Now that we have this state, what we're\nthat we have this state, what we're\nthat we have this state, what we're going to do is we're going to kind of\ngoing to do is we're going to kind of\ngoing to do is we're going to kind of define a graph builder that will work\ndefine a graph builder that will work\ndefine a graph builder that will work using this state because again, if we go\nusing this state because again, if we go\nusing this state because again, if we go back here, this is essentially what\nback here, this is essentially what\nback here, this is essentially what we're going to be creating in these next\nwe're going to be creating in these next\nwe're going to be creating in these next few lines of code. We're going to create\nfew lines of code. We're going to create\nfew lines of code. We're going to create these graphs and then we can run through\nthese graphs and then we can run through\nthese graphs and then we can run through the graph and that represents our AI\nthe graph and that represents our AI\nthe graph and that represents our AI agent or our agentic system. Okay, so on\nagent or our agentic system. Okay, so on\nagent or our agentic system. Okay, so on line 18 here, we're going to say the\nline 18 here, we're going to say the\nline 18 here, we're going to say the graph_builder is equal to a state graph.\ngraph_builder is equal to a state graph.\ngraph_builder is equal to a state graph. Okay. And then for the state graph,\nOkay. And then for the state graph,\nOkay. And then for the state graph, we're going to pass our state. There's\nwe're going to pass our state. There's\nwe're going to pass our state. There's other types of graphs you can have, but\nother types of graphs you can have, but\nother types of graphs you can have, but the state graph is kind of the most\nthe state graph is kind of the most\nthe state graph is kind of the most basic. I don't know why this keeps\nbasic. I don't know why this keeps\nbasic. I don't know why this keeps popping up. I guess I'm highlighting\npopping up. I guess I'm highlighting\npopping up. I guess I'm highlighting something. Okay, so graph builder is\nsomething. Okay, so graph builder is\nsomething. Okay, so graph builder is equal to state graph. And the reason why\nequal to state graph. And the reason why\nequal to state graph. And the reason why we're getting these lines here is\nwe're getting these lines here is\nwe're getting these lines here is because we haven't yet used these\nbecause we haven't yet used these\nbecause we haven't yet used these objects. We'll use them later. So, don't\nobjects. We'll use them later. So, don't\nobjects. We'll use them later. So, don't worry. And let me just add some spacing\nworry. And let me just add some spacing\nworry. And let me just add some spacing here between our class. Okay. So, now we\nhere between our class. Okay. So, now we\nhere between our class. Okay. So, now we have our graph builder. And the next\nhave our graph builder. And the next\nhave our graph builder. And the next thing that we need to do is we need to\nthing that we need to do is we need to\nthing that we need to do is we need to start figuring out these nodes. We're\nstart figuring out these nodes. We're\nstart figuring out these nodes. We're building the nodes that are going to be\nbuilding the nodes that are going to be\nbuilding the nodes that are going to be in our graph. So for right now we're\nin our graph. So for right now we're\nin our graph. So for right now we're going to have a single node which is\ngoing to have a single node which is\ngoing to have a single node which is going to be our chatbot. But later on\ngoing to be our chatbot. But later on\ngoing to be our chatbot. But later on we'll have multiple nodes. So for now\nwe'll have multiple nodes. So for now\nwe'll have multiple nodes. So for now let me show you how you make a simple\nlet me show you how you make a simple\nlet me show you how you make a simple node. So to make a node you simply write\nnode. So to make a node you simply write\nnode. So to make a node you simply write a function. So I'm going to say define\na function. So I'm going to say define\na function. So I'm going to say define chatbot. This node is always going to be\nchatbot. This node is always going to be\nchatbot. This node is always going to be taking in the state. Okay? So, it's\ntaking in the state. Okay? So, it's\ntaking in the state. Okay? So, it's going to take in the state and then it's\ngoing to take in the state and then it's\ngoing to take in the state and then it's going to return essentially a\ngoing to return essentially a\ngoing to return essentially a modification to the state or the next\nmodification to the state or the next\nmodification to the state or the next state that we'll have in our graph.\nstate that we'll have in our graph.\nstate that we'll have in our graph. Again, I know it seems weird. Just bear\nAgain, I know it seems weird. Just bear\nAgain, I know it seems weird. Just bear with me here as we write this out. So,\nwith me here as we write this out. So,\nwith me here as we write this out. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to say\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to say return and I'm going to return something\nreturn and I'm going to return something\nreturn and I'm going to return something that looks exactly like this state right\nthat looks exactly like this state right\nthat looks exactly like this state right here. So, I'm going to say messages.\nhere. So, I'm going to say messages.\nhere. So, I'm going to say messages. Okay? And then inside of a list, I'm\nOkay? And then inside of a list, I'm\nOkay? And then inside of a list, I'm going to say\ngoing to say\ngoing to say llm.invoke. Okay? And for this we're\nllm.invoke. Okay? And for this we're\nllm.invoke. Okay? And for this we're going to take in the\ngoing to take in the\ngoing to take in the state and then messages. Okay. So what\nstate and then messages. Okay. So what\nstate and then messages. Okay. So what I'm doing is I'm saying all right for\nI'm doing is I'm saying all right for\nI'm doing is I'm saying all right for this node I want to take in the current\nthis node I want to take in the current\nthis node I want to take in the current state. The state is going to be a bunch\nstate. The state is going to be a bunch\nstate. The state is going to be a bunch of messages. So what I'm going to do now\nof messages. So what I'm going to do now\nof messages. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to say okay I want to\nis I'm going to say okay I want to\nis I'm going to say okay I want to return now some new messages and these\nreturn now some new messages and these\nreturn now some new messages and these messages are going to be a list. And\nmessages are going to be a list. And\nmessages are going to be a list. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to say\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to say\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to say llm.invoke and then whatever the current\nllm.invoke and then whatever the current\nllm.invoke and then whatever the current messages were. So I take all the\nmessages were. So I take all the\nmessages were. So I take all the messages in my state. I pass that to my\nmessages in my state. I pass that to my\nmessages in my state. I pass that to my llm. When you invoke the LM, it just\nllm. When you invoke the LM, it just\nllm. When you invoke the LM, it just means you're calling the LLM just as if\nmeans you're calling the LLM just as if\nmeans you're calling the LLM just as if you were using like claw desktop or\nyou were using like claw desktop or\nyou were using like claw desktop or something. We're just wrapping that in a\nsomething. We're just wrapping that in a\nsomething. We're just wrapping that in a list and then we're returning that. Now,\nlist and then we're returning that. Now,\nlist and then we're returning that. Now, the way that this works is that it's\nthe way that this works is that it's\nthe way that this works is that it's going to take this list or whatever is\ngoing to take this list or whatever is\ngoing to take this list or whatever is inside of here. It's simply going to add\ninside of here. It's simply going to add\ninside of here. It's simply going to add that into our state because we have this\nthat into our state because we have this\nthat into our state because we have this add messages function. So when we return\nadd messages function. So when we return\nadd messages function. So when we return something that kind of matches this\nsomething that kind of matches this\nsomething that kind of matches this state dictionary, since we've defined\nstate dictionary, since we've defined\nstate dictionary, since we've defined how it is we want to modify this state,\nhow it is we want to modify this state,\nhow it is we want to modify this state, this new message, whatever the LLM\nthis new message, whatever the LLM\nthis new message, whatever the LLM returns to us will simply get added into\nreturns to us will simply get added into\nreturns to us will simply get added into the state. Okay, so that's our first\nthe state. Okay, so that's our first\nthe state. Okay, so that's our first node. Now, in order to use this node, we\nnode. Now, in order to use this node, we\nnode. Now, in order to use this node, we need to register it in our graph. So to\nneed to register it in our graph. So to\nneed to register it in our graph. So to do that, we're going to say graph\ndo that, we're going to say graph\ndo that, we're going to say graph builder, and we're going to say add\nbuilder, and we're going to say add\nbuilder, and we're going to say add node, and we're going to add a node\nnode, and we're going to add a node\nnode, and we're going to add a node called chatbot. And this is going to\ncalled chatbot. And this is going to\ncalled chatbot. And this is going to point to the chatbot function. So\npoint to the chatbot function. So\npoint to the chatbot function. So whenever you want to add a node, let me\nwhenever you want to add a node, let me\nwhenever you want to add a node, let me just do a little bit of spacing here.\njust do a little bit of spacing here.\njust do a little bit of spacing here. The way that this works is you say graph\nThe way that this works is you say graph\nThe way that this works is you say graph builder. Okay, so our graph builder\nbuilder. Okay, so our graph builder\nbuilder. Okay, so our graph builder right here for our state graph. Add\nright here for our state graph. Add\nright here for our state graph. Add node. You give the node some string\nnode. You give the node some string\nnode. You give the node some string name. In this case, we called it\nname. In this case, we called it\nname. In this case, we called it chatbot. And then you point it to some\nchatbot. And then you point it to some\nchatbot. And then you point it to some particular function. All right. So now\nparticular function. All right. So now\nparticular function. All right. So now we have our single node. But the thing\nwe have our single node. But the thing\nwe have our single node. But the thing is in order for our graph to work, we\nis in order for our graph to work, we\nis in order for our graph to work, we always have to have a start node and an\nalways have to have a start node and an\nalways have to have a start node and an end node. So again if we go back here\nend node. So again if we go back here\nend node. So again if we go back here you can see we have start and we have\nyou can see we have start and we have\nyou can see we have start and we have end. We always need this in our graph.\nend. We always need this in our graph.\nend. We always need this in our graph. So we need to connect this node to the\nSo we need to connect this node to the\nSo we need to connect this node to the start and to the end. So in order to do\nstart and to the end. So in order to do\nstart and to the end. So in order to do that we can say\nthat we can say\nthat we can say graph_builder add edge and then when we\ngraph_builder add edge and then when we\ngraph_builder add edge and then when we add the edge we can use the name of our\nadd the edge we can use the name of our\nadd the edge we can use the name of our nodes and connect them. So I want to\nnodes and connect them. So I want to\nnodes and connect them. So I want to connect my start to my chatbot. So\nconnect my start to my chatbot. So\nconnect my start to my chatbot. So that's what I'm going to do. And start\nthat's what I'm going to do. And start\nthat's what I'm going to do. And start again is a variable that we imported\nagain is a variable that we imported\nagain is a variable that we imported here. It's kind of a special value that\nhere. It's kind of a special value that\nhere. It's kind of a special value that represents the start of our graph. Okay,\nrepresents the start of our graph. Okay,\nrepresents the start of our graph. Okay, so we have an edge and we say all right,\nso we have an edge and we say all right,\nso we have an edge and we say all right, we're going to have an edge between\nwe're going to have an edge between\nwe're going to have an edge between start and chatbot. This is a directional\nstart and chatbot. This is a directional\nstart and chatbot. This is a directional edge, which means we go from start to\nedge, which means we go from start to\nedge, which means we go from start to chatbot. And then we can just copy the\nchatbot. And then we can just copy the\nchatbot. And then we can just copy the same thing here. And now rather than\nsame thing here. And now rather than\nsame thing here. And now rather than going from start to chatbot, we're going\ngoing from start to chatbot, we're going\ngoing from start to chatbot, we're going to go from chatbot to the end because\nto go from chatbot to the end because\nto go from chatbot to the end because after we get a response from our chatbot\nafter we get a response from our chatbot\nafter we get a response from our chatbot node, the next step is we just want to\nnode, the next step is we just want to\nnode, the next step is we just want to end. we want to end this system. Okay,\nend. we want to end this system. Okay,\nend. we want to end this system. Okay, that's it. So, we've now just built a\nthat's it. So, we've now just built a\nthat's it. So, we've now just built a really simple graph. We added a single\nreally simple graph. We added a single\nreally simple graph. We added a single node. We added edges between the start\nnode. We added edges between the start\nnode. We added edges between the start node and the chatbot and the chatbot in\nnode and the chatbot and the chatbot in\nnode and the chatbot and the chatbot in the end. And now what's left is to\nthe end. And now what's left is to\nthe end. And now what's left is to simply run this graph. So, let me show\nsimply run this graph. So, let me show\nsimply run this graph. So, let me show you how we do that. So, what we're going\nyou how we do that. So, what we're going\nyou how we do that. So, what we're going to do here is say graph is equal to the\nto do here is say graph is equal to the\nto do here is say graph is equal to the graph\ngraph\ngraph builder.compile. Okay. So, after you\nbuilder.compile. Okay. So, after you\nbuilder.compile. Okay. So, after you construct the graph here by adding the\nconstruct the graph here by adding the\nconstruct the graph here by adding the edges, you're going to compile the\nedges, you're going to compile the\nedges, you're going to compile the graph, which just means you're actually\ngraph, which just means you're actually\ngraph, which just means you're actually going to convert it into something\ngoing to convert it into something\ngoing to convert it into something that's runnable. and then we'll be able\nthat's runnable. and then we'll be able\nthat's runnable. and then we'll be able to run it. Now, in order to run the\nto run it. Now, in order to run the\nto run it. Now, in order to run the graph, we're just going to grab some\ngraph, we're just going to grab some\ngraph, we're just going to grab some user input. So, we're going to say user\nuser input. So, we're going to say user\nuser input. So, we're going to say user input is equal to let's go input here\ninput is equal to let's go input here\ninput is equal to let's go input here and let's go like, you know, enter a\nand let's go like, you know, enter a\nand let's go like, you know, enter a message. Okay? And then we're going to\nmessage. Okay? And then we're going to\nmessage. Okay? And then we're going to say our state is equal to graph dot\nsay our state is equal to graph dot\nsay our state is equal to graph dot invoke. Okay? And let's spell this\ninvoke. Okay? And let's spell this\ninvoke. Okay? And let's spell this correctly. Now, when we invoke the\ncorrectly. Now, when we invoke the\ncorrectly. Now, when we invoke the graph, we can do this by passing the\ngraph, we can do this by passing the\ngraph, we can do this by passing the state that we want the graph to start\nstate that we want the graph to start\nstate that we want the graph to start with. I know again this seems a little\nwith. I know again this seems a little\nwith. I know again this seems a little bit weird but essentially what we're\nbit weird but essentially what we're\nbit weird but essentially what we're going to do is we're going to pass some\ngoing to do is we're going to pass some\ngoing to do is we're going to pass some state here. This is like the initial\nstate here. This is like the initial\nstate here. This is like the initial state that we want to start with which\nstate that we want to start with which\nstate that we want to start with which is going to match this type. Okay. So\nis going to match this type. Okay. So\nis going to match this type. Okay. So here this is really just the type of our\nhere this is really just the type of our\nhere this is really just the type of our state. So now what we're going to do is\nstate. So now what we're going to do is\nstate. So now what we're going to do is we're going to pass some messages. So\nwe're going to pass some messages. So\nwe're going to pass some messages. So we're going to have essentially this\nwe're going to have essentially this\nwe're going to have essentially this dictionary. We're going to say messages\ndictionary. We're going to say messages\ndictionary. We're going to say messages colon. We're going to have a list and\ncolon. We're going to have a list and\ncolon. We're going to have a list and then inside of this list we're going to\nthen inside of this list we're going to\nthen inside of this list we're going to have a ro. This role is going to be the\nhave a ro. This role is going to be the\nhave a ro. This role is going to be the user and then we're going to have\nuser and then we're going to have\nuser and then we're going to have content and the content is going to be\ncontent and the content is going to be\ncontent and the content is going to be the user input. Now, let me just make\nthe user input. Now, let me just make\nthe user input. Now, let me just make this a little bit smaller so that you\nthis a little bit smaller so that you\nthis a little bit smaller so that you guys can see this. Okay, so we have\nguys can see this. Okay, so we have\nguys can see this. Okay, so we have state is equal to graph.invoke and then\nstate is equal to graph.invoke and then\nstate is equal to graph.invoke and then what we're doing is we're passing\nwhat we're doing is we're passing\nwhat we're doing is we're passing messages because again we need to kind\nmessages because again we need to kind\nmessages because again we need to kind of match this state right here which is\nof match this state right here which is\nof match this state right here which is a typed dictionary and then again let me\na typed dictionary and then again let me\na typed dictionary and then again let me get out of this thing. Sorry. We have\nget out of this thing. Sorry. We have\nget out of this thing. Sorry. We have the role is user and then the content is\nthe role is user and then the content is\nthe role is user and then the content is user input. So now because we're\nuser input. So now because we're\nuser input. So now because we're invoking the graph at the end of this\ninvoking the graph at the end of this\ninvoking the graph at the end of this we're going to be able to get the state\nwe're going to be able to get the state\nwe're going to be able to get the state at the end of the graph run. So we can\nat the end of the graph run. So we can\nat the end of the graph run. So we can simply look at that state we can grab\nsimply look at that state we can grab\nsimply look at that state we can grab the last message which should be coming\nthe last message which should be coming\nthe last message which should be coming from our LLM and we can print that out.\nfrom our LLM and we can print that out.\nfrom our LLM and we can print that out. Again I'm going to run through this\nAgain I'm going to run through this\nAgain I'm going to run through this slowly so don't worry but for now we're\nslowly so don't worry but for now we're\nslowly so don't worry but for now we're going to say print state messages and\ngoing to say print state messages and\ngoing to say print state messages and then we're just going to\nsay1content. Okay because all of the\nsay1content. Okay because all of the messages are going to have this ro and\nmessages are going to have this ro and\nmessages are going to have this ro and this content field. They actually have\nthis content field. They actually have\nthis content field. They actually have some other fields as well, but in our\nsome other fields as well, but in our\nsome other fields as well, but in our case, we just care about the content.\ncase, we just care about the content.\ncase, we just care about the content. That's what we want to print out. So,\nThat's what we want to print out. So,\nThat's what we want to print out. So, what I want to do now is I want to run\nwhat I want to do now is I want to run\nwhat I want to do now is I want to run this code. I just want to make sure it\nthis code. I just want to make sure it\nthis code. I just want to make sure it works. And then I'm again I'm going to\nworks. And then I'm again I'm going to\nworks. And then I'm again I'm going to walk through it step by step so that you\nwalk through it step by step so that you\nwalk through it step by step so that you fully understand it. So, let's press run\nfully understand it. So, let's press run\nfully understand it. So, let's press run here. It's going to open up our\nhere. It's going to open up our\nhere. It's going to open up our terminal. It asks us to enter a message.\nterminal. It asks us to enter a message.\nterminal. It asks us to enter a message. Let's go with something simple like\nLet's go with something simple like\nLet's go with something simple like hello world. Let's wait a second. And\nhello world. Let's wait a second. And\nhello world. Let's wait a second. And you can see it says hi, how can I help\nyou can see it says hi, how can I help\nyou can see it says hi, how can I help you today? Okay, let's run this again.\nyou today? Okay, let's run this again.\nyou today? Okay, let's run this again. Let's say you know what is the square\nLet's say you know what is the square\nLet's say you know what is the square root of you know 128 or something and\nroot of you know 128 or something and\nroot of you know 128 or something and let's see what it gives us and give this\nlet's see what it gives us and give this\nlet's see what it gives us and give this a second and it says so the square root\na second and it says so the square root\na second and it says so the square root is 8 &lt;unk&gt;2 which is approximately\nis 8 &lt;unk&gt;2 which is approximately\nis 8 &lt;unk&gt;2 which is approximately 11.137 and it kind of gives us the\n11.137 and it kind of gives us the\n11.137 and it kind of gives us the response. Okay so let's walk through\nresponse. Okay so let's walk through\nresponse. Okay so let's walk through what's happening here because I fully\nwhat's happening here because I fully\nwhat's happening here because I fully understand this is a bit confusing\nunderstand this is a bit confusing\nunderstand this is a bit confusing especially if it's your first time\nespecially if it's your first time\nespecially if it's your first time seeing it. So of course we start with\nseeing it. So of course we start with\nseeing it. So of course we start with our imports. All these ones that we're\nour imports. All these ones that we're\nour imports. All these ones that we're missing we're going to use in one second\nmissing we're going to use in one second\nmissing we're going to use in one second when we make the example a little bit\nwhen we make the example a little bit\nwhen we make the example a little bit more advanced. We load in our\nmore advanced. We load in our\nmore advanced. We load in our environment variables. We initialize our\nenvironment variables. We initialize our\nenvironment variables. We initialize our LLM and then we create this state. Now\nLLM and then we create this state. Now\nLLM and then we create this state. Now the state is really just defining the\nthe state is really just defining the\nthe state is really just defining the type of information that we want to have\ntype of information that we want to have\ntype of information that we want to have as we run through this graph. Right now\nas we run through this graph. Right now\nas we run through this graph. Right now it's quite simple because the graph is\nit's quite simple because the graph is\nit's quite simple because the graph is just this right start chatbot end. But\njust this right start chatbot end. But\njust this right start chatbot end. But later on you can have some more advanced\nlater on you can have some more advanced\nlater on you can have some more advanced state which will kind of allow you to\nstate which will kind of allow you to\nstate which will kind of allow you to control what edge you go down or what\ncontrol what edge you go down or what\ncontrol what edge you go down or what path you go down in the state. Then we\npath you go down in the state. Then we\npath you go down in the state. Then we have our graph builder. So we say okay\nhave our graph builder. So we say okay\nhave our graph builder. So we say okay we want to eventually build a graph\nwe want to eventually build a graph\nwe want to eventually build a graph using this state. We're going to use a\nusing this state. We're going to use a\nusing this state. We're going to use a state graph. So we take in the state\nstate graph. So we take in the state\nstate graph. So we take in the state that we defined and then we have our\nthat we defined and then we have our\nthat we defined and then we have our nodes. Now in these nodes you can do\nnodes. Now in these nodes you can do\nnodes. Now in these nodes you can do anything that you want but typically\nanything that you want but typically\nanything that you want but typically what these nodes do is they modify the\nwhat these nodes do is they modify the\nwhat these nodes do is they modify the state or they check the state. So in\nstate or they check the state. So in\nstate or they check the state. So in this case all we're doing is we're\nthis case all we're doing is we're\nthis case all we're doing is we're invoking the LLM using all of the\ninvoking the LLM using all of the\ninvoking the LLM using all of the messages that are currently in our\nmessages that are currently in our\nmessages that are currently in our state. So that will come from here when\nstate. So that will come from here when\nstate. So that will come from here when we start with this message. Okay. Okay,\nwe start with this message. Okay. Okay,\nwe start with this message. Okay. Okay, we then take whatever the next message\nwe then take whatever the next message\nwe then take whatever the next message is and we add that into messages. Okay,\nis and we add that into messages. Okay,\nis and we add that into messages. Okay, then we construct a graph. So we say,\nthen we construct a graph. So we say,\nthen we construct a graph. So we say, all right, we want to have this node\nall right, we want to have this node\nall right, we want to have this node chatbot connected to this node, this\nchatbot connected to this node, this\nchatbot connected to this node, this function right here. We add our edge. So\nfunction right here. We add our edge. So\nfunction right here. We add our edge. So start edge and the end. And then we\nstart edge and the end. And then we\nstart edge and the end. And then we compile the graph and we run it. Now at\ncompile the graph and we run it. Now at\ncompile the graph and we run it. Now at this point when we run it, we start it\nthis point when we run it, we start it\nthis point when we run it, we start it with a single message. The reason for\nwith a single message. The reason for\nwith a single message. The reason for that is we're immediately going to go to\nthat is we're immediately going to go to\nthat is we're immediately going to go to this node. This node is going to check\nthis node. This node is going to check\nthis node. This node is going to check the state. It's going to take our\nthe state. It's going to take our\nthe state. It's going to take our starting message and then it's going to\nstarting message and then it's going to\nstarting message and then it's going to run this. Okay. And that's how it works.\nrun this. Okay. And that's how it works.\nrun this. Okay. And that's how it works. Now, if you want to see something, we\nNow, if you want to see something, we\nNow, if you want to see something, we can print out all of the messages that\ncan print out all of the messages that\ncan print out all of the messages that we have. So, let's just print the kind\nwe have. So, let's just print the kind\nwe have. So, let's just print the kind of uh what do you call this here? State\nof uh what do you call this here? State\nof uh what do you call this here? State messages just so you can see what it\nmessages just so you can see what it\nmessages just so you can see what it looks like. And you can see that we are\nlooks like. And you can see that we are\nlooks like. And you can see that we are tracking all of the messages. So, if we\ntracking all of the messages. So, if we\ntracking all of the messages. So, if we run this again, let's just go hello.\nrun this again, let's just go hello.\nrun this again, let's just go hello. Okay. And I just want to show you the\nOkay. And I just want to show you the\nOkay. And I just want to show you the kind of output here. And you can see we\nkind of output here. And you can see we\nkind of output here. And you can see we have a human message that says hello.\nhave a human message that says hello.\nhave a human message that says hello. And then if we keep scrolling here, we\nAnd then if we keep scrolling here, we\nAnd then if we keep scrolling here, we have an AI message and it says, \"Hi, how\nhave an AI message and it says, \"Hi, how\nhave an AI message and it says, \"Hi, how can I help you?\" And you can see there's\ncan I help you?\" And you can see there's\ncan I help you?\" And you can see there's some other fields in here like this is\nsome other fields in here like this is\nsome other fields in here like this is the content that we're printing out. But\nthe content that we're printing out. But\nthe content that we're printing out. But we also get, for example, the model that\nwe also get, for example, the model that\nwe also get, for example, the model that we use, the stop reason, all of this\nwe use, the stop reason, all of this\nwe use, the stop reason, all of this kind of stuff. Okay? So that's why I'm\nkind of stuff. Okay? So that's why I'm\nkind of stuff. Okay? So that's why I'm just printing out the uh the content. So\njust printing out the uh the content. So\njust printing out the uh the content. So we have two messages, right? Because\nwe have two messages, right? Because\nwe have two messages, right? Because we're tracking all of the messages in\nwe're tracking all of the messages in\nwe're tracking all of the messages in our state. And then what I did is I\nour state. And then what I did is I\nour state. And then what I did is I grabbed the last message and I just\ngrabbed the last message and I just\ngrabbed the last message and I just printed the content. Okay? So quick\nprinted the content. Okay? So quick\nprinted the content. Okay? So quick pause here. this graph that you see\npause here. this graph that you see\npause here. this graph that you see here, you can actually generate this for\nhere, you can actually generate this for\nhere, you can actually generate this for any of the um what do you call it? The\nany of the um what do you call it? The\nany of the um what do you call it? The graphs that you make in Langraph. Now,\ngraphs that you make in Langraph. Now,\ngraphs that you make in Langraph. Now, in order to do that, I'm just going to\nin order to do that, I'm just going to\nin order to do that, I'm just going to show you a code snippet. So, if you go\nshow you a code snippet. So, if you go\nshow you a code snippet. So, if you go to this website right here, it's\nto this website right here, it's\nto this website right here, it's actually the getting started guide for\nactually the getting started guide for\nactually the getting started guide for Langraph. They have this right here,\nLangraph. They have this right here,\nLangraph. They have this right here, this code from ipython.dis, import\nthis code from ipython.dis, import\nthis code from ipython.dis, import image, etc. If you run this at the\nimage, etc. If you run this at the\nimage, etc. If you run this at the bottom of your script, if you're inside\nbottom of your script, if you're inside\nbottom of your script, if you're inside of a Jupiter notebook, then it will\nof a Jupiter notebook, then it will\nof a Jupiter notebook, then it will allow you to actually save this image or\nallow you to actually save this image or\nallow you to actually save this image or to view the image. Now, I'm not going to\nto view the image. Now, I'm not going to\nto view the image. Now, I'm not going to do all of this right now, but\ndo all of this right now, but\ndo all of this right now, but essentially what you would do is you\nessentially what you would do is you\nessentially what you would do is you would make a new Jupyter notebook. You\nwould make a new Jupyter notebook. You\nwould make a new Jupyter notebook. You would just paste this at the bottom. So,\nwould just paste this at the bottom. So,\nwould just paste this at the bottom. So, you take all of this code, paste it in a\nyou take all of this code, paste it in a\nyou take all of this code, paste it in a Jupyter note Jupyter notebook, simply\nJupyter note Jupyter notebook, simply\nJupyter note Jupyter notebook, simply run the cell, and then it's going to\nrun the cell, and then it's going to\nrun the cell, and then it's going to generate the image for you. Okay? If\ngenerate the image for you. Okay? If\ngenerate the image for you. Okay? If you're unfamiliar with Jupyter\nyou're unfamiliar with Jupyter\nyou're unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, that's not really the\nnotebooks, that's not really the\nnotebooks, that's not really the tutorial that I'm aiming to do. So, I'm\ntutorial that I'm aiming to do. So, I'm\ntutorial that I'm aiming to do. So, I'm not going to walk through those steps,\nnot going to walk through those steps,\nnot going to walk through those steps, but if you are, then you can generate\nbut if you are, then you can generate\nbut if you are, then you can generate the graph and you can see it. Now, I\nthe graph and you can see it. Now, I\nthe graph and you can see it. Now, I already generated them obviously, so I\nalready generated them obviously, so I\nalready generated them obviously, so I don't need to do that. But if you want\ndon't need to do that. But if you want\ndon't need to do that. But if you want to test it out and kind of make sure the\nto test it out and kind of make sure the\nto test it out and kind of make sure the graph looks as you expect it to, then\ngraph looks as you expect it to, then\ngraph looks as you expect it to, then that's what you can do. Okay. So now\nthat's what you can do. Okay. So now\nthat's what you can do. Okay. So now that we've created this simple example,\nthat we've created this simple example,\nthat we've created this simple example, I want to move to a more complex one\nI want to move to a more complex one\nI want to move to a more complex one where we build out this graph right here\nwhere we build out this graph right here\nwhere we build out this graph right here where we have a classifier, a router,\nwhere we have a classifier, a router,\nwhere we have a classifier, a router, and then we can go between multiple AI\nand then we can go between multiple AI\nand then we can go between multiple AI agents. Now, my idea is that sometimes\nagents. Now, my idea is that sometimes\nagents. Now, my idea is that sometimes you want maybe a more emotional response\nyou want maybe a more emotional response\nyou want maybe a more emotional response or sometimes you want a very logical\nor sometimes you want a very logical\nor sometimes you want a very logical response. For example, if you were to\nresponse. For example, if you were to\nresponse. For example, if you were to talk to me, I'm probably going to give\ntalk to me, I'm probably going to give\ntalk to me, I'm probably going to give you a logical response. If you were to\nyou a logical response. If you were to\nyou a logical response. If you were to talk to my mom, she's probably going to\ntalk to my mom, she's probably going to\ntalk to my mom, she's probably going to give you an emotional response. So, what\ngive you an emotional response. So, what\ngive you an emotional response. So, what I want to do is I want to create an AI\nI want to do is I want to create an AI\nI want to do is I want to create an AI system where based on what the user is\nsystem where based on what the user is\nsystem where based on what the user is saying, we can kind of adapt how we're\nsaying, we can kind of adapt how we're\nsaying, we can kind of adapt how we're responding to them using two different\nresponding to them using two different\nresponding to them using two different AI agents. So, the concept is we're\nAI agents. So, the concept is we're\nAI agents. So, the concept is we're going to start here. The user is going\ngoing to start here. The user is going\ngoing to start here. The user is going to give us some input. We're going to\nto give us some input. We're going to\nto give us some input. We're going to classify that input whether we go\nclassify that input whether we go\nclassify that input whether we go logical or or uh therapist. Sorry,\nlogical or or uh therapist. Sorry,\nlogical or or uh therapist. Sorry, that's what I'm calling this here, but\nthat's what I'm calling this here, but\nthat's what I'm calling this here, but really it's emotional. We're then going\nreally it's emotional. We're then going\nreally it's emotional. We're then going to have a router. The router is going to\nto have a router. The router is going to\nto have a router. The router is going to look at the classification. If the\nlook at the classification. If the\nlook at the classification. If the classification is logical, it's going to\nclassification is logical, it's going to\nclassification is logical, it's going to ask the logical agent to give us a\nask the logical agent to give us a\nask the logical agent to give us a reply. If it's emotional or therapist,\nreply. If it's emotional or therapist,\nreply. If it's emotional or therapist, it's going to ask the therapist agent to\nit's going to ask the therapist agent to\nit's going to ask the therapist agent to give us a response. So, that's what I\ngive us a response. So, that's what I\ngive us a response. So, that's what I want to generate. So, let's move over\nwant to generate. So, let's move over\nwant to generate. So, let's move over now and see how we do that. It does\nnow and see how we do that. It does\nnow and see how we do that. It does require a few more steps. Let's remove\nrequire a few more steps. Let's remove\nrequire a few more steps. Let's remove the bottom four lines here. Let me get\nthe bottom four lines here. Let me get\nthe bottom four lines here. Let me get out of this bottom four lines. Okay. And\nout of this bottom four lines. Okay. And\nout of this bottom four lines. Okay. And let's go back up to the top and let's\nlet's go back up to the top and let's\nlet's go back up to the top and let's start by modifying our state. So in our\nstart by modifying our state. So in our\nstart by modifying our state. So in our state like before I do want to keep\nstate like before I do want to keep\nstate like before I do want to keep track of all of the messages that we had\ntrack of all of the messages that we had\ntrack of all of the messages that we had but I also want to have another piece of\nbut I also want to have another piece of\nbut I also want to have another piece of state that specifies the message type\nstate that specifies the message type\nstate that specifies the message type that we're going to be using. Okay,\nthat we're going to be using. Okay,\nthat we're going to be using. Okay, because we are either going to have like\nbecause we are either going to have like\nbecause we are either going to have like the emotional message type or the\nthe emotional message type or the\nthe emotional message type or the logical message type and we need to know\nlogical message type and we need to know\nlogical message type and we need to know that in the state of our graph. So we\nthat in the state of our graph. So we\nthat in the state of our graph. So we know which AI agent should kind of\nknow which AI agent should kind of\nknow which AI agent should kind of handle the next task. So for this I'm\nhandle the next task. So for this I'm\nhandle the next task. So for this I'm going to say this is string or none as\ngoing to say this is string or none as\ngoing to say this is string or none as the type uh because we may not have any\nthe type uh because we may not have any\nthe type uh because we may not have any message type but if we do then it will\nmessage type but if we do then it will\nmessage type but if we do then it will be a string. Okay. So when we start it's\nbe a string. Okay. So when we start it's\nbe a string. Okay. So when we start it's nothing and then later we can add some\nnothing and then later we can add some\nnothing and then later we can add some string to it. So now that we have the\nstring to it. So now that we have the\nstring to it. So now that we have the state I'm also going to make another\nstate I'm also going to make another\nstate I'm also going to make another class above this which is going to be a\nclass above this which is going to be a\nclass above this which is going to be a type that we're going to use for\ntype that we're going to use for\ntype that we're going to use for something called a structured output\nsomething called a structured output\nsomething called a structured output parser. Okay, you'll see how this works\nparser. Okay, you'll see how this works\nparser. Okay, you'll see how this works in one second but it's pretty cool. So\nin one second but it's pretty cool. So\nin one second but it's pretty cool. So we're going to say class and this is\nwe're going to say class and this is\nwe're going to say class and this is going to be message classifier. Okay.\ngoing to be message classifier. Okay.\ngoing to be message classifier. Okay. And this is going to be a type. It's\nAnd this is going to be a type. It's\nAnd this is going to be a type. It's going to inherit from the base model of\ngoing to inherit from the base model of\ngoing to inherit from the base model of paidantic. Pyantic is a typing system in\npaidantic. Pyantic is a typing system in\npaidantic. Pyantic is a typing system in Python. Okay. And inside of here, what\nPython. Okay. And inside of here, what\nPython. Okay. And inside of here, what we're going to do is the following.\nwe're going to do is the following.\nwe're going to do is the following. We're going to say our message. And then\nWe're going to say our message. And then\nWe're going to say our message. And then this is going to be underscore type is\nthis is going to be underscore type is\nthis is going to be underscore type is of type literal. Okay. And then for the\nof type literal. Okay. And then for the\nof type literal. Okay. And then for the literal, we're going to have emotional\nliteral, we're going to have emotional\nliteral, we're going to have emotional as one of the types and logical as the\nas one of the types and logical as the\nas one of the types and logical as the other. Okay. Now, why is this not giving\nother. Okay. Now, why is this not giving\nother. Okay. Now, why is this not giving us the correct highlighting? Okay, there\nus the correct highlighting? Okay, there\nus the correct highlighting? Okay, there we go. It's fine. now and we're going to\nwe go. It's fine. now and we're going to\nwe go. It's fine. now and we're going to say this is equal to field and inside of\nsay this is equal to field and inside of\nsay this is equal to field and inside of here we're going to have dot dot dot\nhere we're going to have dot dot dot\nhere we're going to have dot dot dot comma and then we're going to have a\ncomma and then we're going to have a\ncomma and then we're going to have a description okay which is going to\ndescription okay which is going to\ndescription okay which is going to define how we kind of fill in this value\ndefine how we kind of fill in this value\ndefine how we kind of fill in this value again give me a second to type this out\nagain give me a second to type this out\nagain give me a second to type this out it's kind of hard to type and explain at\nit's kind of hard to type and explain at\nit's kind of hard to type and explain at the same time and then I will break down\nthe same time and then I will break down\nthe same time and then I will break down kind of what this is so we're going to\nkind of what this is so we're going to\nkind of what this is so we're going to say classify if the message requires an\nsay classify if the message requires an\nsay classify if the message requires an emotional\nemotional\nemotional or\nor\nor logical response. Okay, so we can say\nlogical response. Okay, so we can say\nlogical response. Okay, so we can say emotional and maybe we'll just go like\nemotional and maybe we'll just go like\nemotional and maybe we'll just go like therapist here to be a bit more clear.\ntherapist here to be a bit more clear.\ntherapist here to be a bit more clear. And then we're going to save that. So\nAnd then we're going to save that. So\nAnd then we're going to save that. So what I'm doing, let me just space this\nwhat I'm doing, let me just space this\nwhat I'm doing, let me just space this out here, is I'm making this pideantic\nout here, is I'm making this pideantic\nout here, is I'm making this pideantic type and I'm saying that in the type I\ntype and I'm saying that in the type I\ntype and I'm saying that in the type I want to have this field which is of\nwant to have this field which is of\nwant to have this field which is of message type. Now this is going to be a\nmessage type. Now this is going to be a\nmessage type. Now this is going to be a literal. Literal just means it's like an\nliteral. Literal just means it's like an\nliteral. Literal just means it's like an exact value and the value is either\nexact value and the value is either\nexact value and the value is either going to be emotional or logical. Okay,\ngoing to be emotional or logical. Okay,\ngoing to be emotional or logical. Okay, that's kind of what I mean by literal\nthat's kind of what I mean by literal\nthat's kind of what I mean by literal value, like a literal string. And we're\nvalue, like a literal string. And we're\nvalue, like a literal string. And we're saying this is equal to a pyantic field.\nsaying this is equal to a pyantic field.\nsaying this is equal to a pyantic field. The three dots, don't worry about that.\nThe three dots, don't worry about that.\nThe three dots, don't worry about that. We just put that here in order to now\nWe just put that here in order to now\nWe just put that here in order to now add the description. And then we specify\nadd the description. And then we specify\nadd the description. And then we specify kind of what this field represents. So\nkind of what this field represents. So\nkind of what this field represents. So we're saying, okay, the message type is\nwe're saying, okay, the message type is\nwe're saying, okay, the message type is going to be a classification. If the\ngoing to be a classification. If the\ngoing to be a classification. If the message requires an emotional therapist,\nmessage requires an emotional therapist,\nmessage requires an emotional therapist, let's spell this correctly. Okay, so\nlet's spell this correctly. Okay, so\nlet's spell this correctly. Okay, so you'll see how we use this in a second,\nyou'll see how we use this in a second,\nyou'll see how we use this in a second, but essentially what we're going to do\nbut essentially what we're going to do\nbut essentially what we're going to do is we're going to have a stage within\nis we're going to have a stage within\nis we're going to have a stage within our kind of agentic system here where we\nour kind of agentic system here where we\nour kind of agentic system here where we ask an LLM to give us an output that\nask an LLM to give us an output that\nask an LLM to give us an output that matches this paidantic type. So that's\nmatches this paidantic type. So that's\nmatches this paidantic type. So that's why I'm defining it here. And you can\nwhy I'm defining it here. And you can\nwhy I'm defining it here. And you can make these types anything that you want.\nmake these types anything that you want.\nmake these types anything that you want. You can have as many fields as you want,\nYou can have as many fields as you want,\nYou can have as many fields as you want, but what's important is that you specify\nbut what's important is that you specify\nbut what's important is that you specify the type of the field, which we did\nthe type of the field, which we did\nthe type of the field, which we did here, and then you give the field a\nhere, and then you give the field a\nhere, and then you give the field a description so the model knows how to\ndescription so the model knows how to\ndescription so the model knows how to fill this in. So we're using this as a\nfill this in. So we're using this as a\nfill this in. So we're using this as a classification. But for example, if you\nclassification. But for example, if you\nclassification. But for example, if you wanted to collect someone's personal\nwanted to collect someone's personal\nwanted to collect someone's personal details, you can make another class like\ndetails, you can make another class like\ndetails, you can make another class like you know person and then inside of here\nyou know person and then inside of here\nyou know person and then inside of here you have all the fields like name,\nyou have all the fields like name,\nyou have all the fields like name, string is equal to a field. You give\nstring is equal to a field. You give\nstring is equal to a field. You give this a description etc. And all of the\nthis a description etc. And all of the\nthis a description etc. And all of the things that you want the model to kind\nthings that you want the model to kind\nthings that you want the model to kind of extract from the text you would put\nof extract from the text you would put\nof extract from the text you would put inside of this model and you then tell\ninside of this model and you then tell\ninside of this model and you then tell the LLM, hey use this particular model\nthe LLM, hey use this particular model\nthe LLM, hey use this particular model and give me a response in this format.\nand give me a response in this format.\nand give me a response in this format. It's called a structured output format.\nIt's called a structured output format.\nIt's called a structured output format. You're going to see this in just one\nYou're going to see this in just one\nYou're going to see this in just one second. Okay, so now we have our state,\nsecond. Okay, so now we have our state,\nsecond. Okay, so now we have our state, we have our message classifier type, and\nwe have our message classifier type, and\nwe have our message classifier type, and we want to start building out our\nwe want to start building out our\nwe want to start building out our various nodes. Now, I'm going to remove\nvarious nodes. Now, I'm going to remove\nvarious nodes. Now, I'm going to remove this whole graph because right now we\nthis whole graph because right now we\nthis whole graph because right now we don't need any of that, and we will\ndon't need any of that, and we will\ndon't need any of that, and we will leave the compile because we'll use that\nleave the compile because we'll use that\nleave the compile because we'll use that in one second. All right, so after this,\nin one second. All right, so after this,\nin one second. All right, so after this, we're going to start uh defining our\nwe're going to start uh defining our\nwe're going to start uh defining our various functions. Okay, so we're going\nvarious functions. Okay, so we're going\nvarious functions. Okay, so we're going to say define, and the first thing we're\nto say define, and the first thing we're\nto say define, and the first thing we're going to have is\ngoing to have is\ngoing to have is classify message. Okay, now this is\nclassify message. Okay, now this is\nclassify message. Okay, now this is going to take in our state. And for now\ngoing to take in our state. And for now\ngoing to take in our state. And for now I'm just going to say pass and we'll\nI'm just going to say pass and we'll\nI'm just going to say pass and we'll write that in just one second. Now after\nwrite that in just one second. Now after\nwrite that in just one second. Now after classify message we're going to have\nclassify message we're going to have\nclassify message we're going to have define\ndefine\ndefine therapist and this is going to be agent.\ntherapist and this is going to be agent.\ntherapist and this is going to be agent. Okay, this again is going to take in our\nOkay, this again is going to take in our\nOkay, this again is going to take in our state and for now we're going to pass.\nstate and for now we're going to pass.\nstate and for now we're going to pass. Now why can I not spell therapist\nNow why can I not spell therapist\nNow why can I not spell therapist correctly or is that correct? I think\ncorrectly or is that correct? I think\ncorrectly or is that correct? I think therapist. There you go. Is now correct.\ntherapist. There you go. Is now correct.\ntherapist. There you go. Is now correct. Okay. Okay, then we're going to have\nOkay. Okay, then we're going to have\nOkay. Okay, then we're going to have another one and we're going to say this\nanother one and we're going to say this\nanother one and we're going to say this is going to be logical agent and we're\nis going to be logical agent and we're\nis going to be logical agent and we're going to take in state and state and\ngoing to take in state and state and\ngoing to take in state and state and then pass. Okay, so what we're doing so\nthen pass. Okay, so what we're doing so\nthen pass. Okay, so what we're doing so far is we're saying all right, we want\nfar is we're saying all right, we want\nfar is we're saying all right, we want to have this classify message node.\nto have this classify message node.\nto have this classify message node. We're going to have a therapist agent\nWe're going to have a therapist agent\nWe're going to have a therapist agent node and a logical agent node. And then\nnode and a logical agent node. And then\nnode and a logical agent node. And then what are we missing? Well, we need one\nwhat are we missing? Well, we need one\nwhat are we missing? Well, we need one more which is going to be our router. So\nmore which is going to be our router. So\nmore which is going to be our router. So we're going to say define router. Same\nwe're going to say define router. Same\nwe're going to say define router. Same thing here for the router. We're going\nthing here for the router. We're going\nthing here for the router. We're going to take in the state like we do for all\nto take in the state like we do for all\nto take in the state like we do for all of our nodes. we are going to pass and\nof our nodes. we are going to pass and\nof our nodes. we are going to pass and then we're going to space this out. So\nthen we're going to space this out. So\nthen we're going to space this out. So we can start writing these one by one\nwe can start writing these one by one\nwe can start writing these one by one but I like to just define the nodes that\nbut I like to just define the nodes that\nbut I like to just define the nodes that we're going to have up front so that we\nwe're going to have up front so that we\nwe're going to have up front so that we know what it is that we're about to be\nknow what it is that we're about to be\nknow what it is that we're about to be doing. And again if we look here we have\ndoing. And again if we look here we have\ndoing. And again if we look here we have a classifier, a router, logical and\na classifier, a router, logical and\na classifier, a router, logical and therapist. Okay, so we've kind of\ntherapist. Okay, so we've kind of\ntherapist. Okay, so we've kind of written the function to represent all\nwritten the function to represent all\nwritten the function to represent all four of these. So let's start with\nfour of these. So let's start with\nfour of these. So let's start with classify message. Now for classify\nclassify message. Now for classify\nclassify message. Now for classify message we're going to start by getting\nmessage we're going to start by getting\nmessage we're going to start by getting the last message. So we're going to say\nthe last message. So we're going to say\nthe last message. So we're going to say last message is equal to state messages\nlast message is equal to state messages\nlast message is equal to state messages and then negative one. So, whatever the\nand then negative one. So, whatever the\nand then negative one. So, whatever the user last type, well, we're going to get\nuser last type, well, we're going to get\nuser last type, well, we're going to get that and then we're going to use that to\nthat and then we're going to use that to\nthat and then we're going to use that to well classify it. We're then going to\nwell classify it. We're then going to\nwell classify it. We're then going to say our classifier LLM is equal to our\nsay our classifier LLM is equal to our\nsay our classifier LLM is equal to our LLM dot and this is going to be\nLLM dot and this is going to be\nLLM dot and this is going to be with_structured output. We then are\nwith_structured output. We then are\nwith_structured output. We then are going to pass our message classifier.\ngoing to pass our message classifier.\ngoing to pass our message classifier. So, what we're doing now is we're\nSo, what we're doing now is we're\nSo, what we're doing now is we're creating essentially a version of our\ncreating essentially a version of our\ncreating essentially a version of our LLM that will give us only output that\nLLM that will give us only output that\nLLM that will give us only output that matches this pyantic model. So that's\nmatches this pyantic model. So that's\nmatches this pyantic model. So that's how we use this kind of structured\nhow we use this kind of structured\nhow we use this kind of structured output class. Okay. Now that we have\noutput class. Okay. Now that we have\noutput class. Okay. Now that we have that, what we can do is we can invoke\nthat, what we can do is we can invoke\nthat, what we can do is we can invoke the classifier LLM. So we're going to\nthe classifier LLM. So we're going to\nthe classifier LLM. So we're going to say result is equal to the classifier\nsay result is equal to the classifier\nsay result is equal to the classifier LLM do.invoke and then inside of here we\nLLM do.invoke and then inside of here we\nLLM do.invoke and then inside of here we can put a list of messages that we want\ncan put a list of messages that we want\ncan put a list of messages that we want to invoke. Now the first thing we need\nto invoke. Now the first thing we need\nto invoke. Now the first thing we need to do is we need to tell the classifier\nto do is we need to tell the classifier\nto do is we need to tell the classifier what it should be doing. So, we're going\nwhat it should be doing. So, we're going\nwhat it should be doing. So, we're going to specify a message and we're going to\nto specify a message and we're going to\nto specify a message and we're going to say roll is system. Okay, this means\nsay roll is system. Okay, this means\nsay roll is system. Okay, this means this is not a user message. This is\nthis is not a user message. This is\nthis is not a user message. This is coming from the system like instructions\ncoming from the system like instructions\ncoming from the system like instructions on what this should do. And then we're\non what this should do. And then we're\non what this should do. And then we're going to say content. And inside of\ngoing to say content. And inside of\ngoing to say content. And inside of here, we're going to write kind of what\nhere, we're going to write kind of what\nhere, we're going to write kind of what the instructions are for this model. So,\nthe instructions are for this model. So,\nthe instructions are for this model. So, I'm just going to paste them in here.\nI'm just going to paste them in here.\nI'm just going to paste them in here. Again, you can copy this from the link\nAgain, you can copy this from the link\nAgain, you can copy this from the link in the description, but essentially this\nin the description, but essentially this\nin the description, but essentially this is what we want. So we're going to say\nis what we want. So we're going to say\nis what we want. So we're going to say that we want to classify the user\nthat we want to classify the user\nthat we want to classify the user message as either emotional or logical.\nmessage as either emotional or logical.\nmessage as either emotional or logical. Now it's emotional if it asks for\nNow it's emotional if it asks for\nNow it's emotional if it asks for emotional support, therapy, deals with\nemotional support, therapy, deals with\nemotional support, therapy, deals with feelings or personal problems and\nfeelings or personal problems and\nfeelings or personal problems and logical if it asks for facts,\nlogical if it asks for facts,\nlogical if it asks for facts, information, logical analysis or\ninformation, logical analysis or\ninformation, logical analysis or practical solutions. So this system\npractical solutions. So this system\npractical solutions. So this system prompt in combination with the\nprompt in combination with the\nprompt in combination with the description of our message classifier\ndescription of our message classifier\ndescription of our message classifier classifier pideantic model will allow\nclassifier pideantic model will allow\nclassifier pideantic model will allow the LLM to take the user message which\nthe LLM to take the user message which\nthe LLM to take the user message which we're going to put here in one second\nwe're going to put here in one second\nwe're going to put here in one second and then classify it into this\nand then classify it into this\nand then classify it into this structured output. So after we have the\nstructured output. So after we have the\nstructured output. So after we have the system message, we're also going to\nsystem message, we're also going to\nsystem message, we're also going to specify the user message. So we're going\nspecify the user message. So we're going\nspecify the user message. So we're going to say roll user and then we're going to\nto say roll user and then we're going to\nto say roll user and then we're going to say the content is simply the last\nsay the content is simply the last\nsay the content is simply the last message dot content. Okay. And we're\nmessage dot content. Okay. And we're\nmessage dot content. Okay. And we're going to pass all of this to the\ngoing to pass all of this to the\ngoing to pass all of this to the classifier llm. And then what we can do\nclassifier llm. And then what we can do\nclassifier llm. And then what we can do is we can return whatever this result\nis we can return whatever this result\nis we can return whatever this result is. So, we're going to say return, and\nis. So, we're going to say return, and\nis. So, we're going to say return, and then we're going to say\nthen we're going to say\nthen we're going to say message type, and this is going to be\nmessage type, and this is going to be\nmessage type, and this is going to be result dot message type. Uh, oops. So,\nresult dot message type. Uh, oops. So,\nresult dot message type. Uh, oops. So, let's go back here. Message underscore\nlet's go back here. Message underscore\nlet's go back here. Message underscore type. Now, again, the way that this kind\ntype. Now, again, the way that this kind\ntype. Now, again, the way that this kind of works is because we're returning\nof works is because we're returning\nof works is because we're returning something that matches something in our\nsomething that matches something in our\nsomething that matches something in our state, we're automatically going to\nstate, we're automatically going to\nstate, we're automatically going to update the message type in this state to\nupdate the message type in this state to\nupdate the message type in this state to be equal to whatever this is. So when\nbe equal to whatever this is. So when\nbe equal to whatever this is. So when you're returning something from these\nyou're returning something from these\nyou're returning something from these nodes, as long as you match one of the\nnodes, as long as you match one of the\nnodes, as long as you match one of the types with the state, which is what\ntypes with the state, which is what\ntypes with the state, which is what we're supposed to do, then it's going to\nwe're supposed to do, then it's going to\nwe're supposed to do, then it's going to update that state for us, which means\nupdate that state for us, which means\nupdate that state for us, which means now in the next steps of our graph,\nnow in the next steps of our graph,\nnow in the next steps of our graph, we'll be able to access this state and\nwe'll be able to access this state and\nwe'll be able to access this state and know what it is that we should do next.\nknow what it is that we should do next.\nknow what it is that we should do next. Okay, so that's our classify message.\nOkay, so that's our classify message.\nOkay, so that's our classify message. Now that we've classified the message,\nNow that we've classified the message,\nNow that we've classified the message, we need to look at our router, sorry, so\nwe need to look at our router, sorry, so\nwe need to look at our router, sorry, so that we know what to do next\nthat we know what to do next\nthat we know what to do next essentially. Should we route to the\nessentially. Should we route to the\nessentially. Should we route to the therapist or should we route to the\ntherapist or should we route to the\ntherapist or should we route to the logical agent? So inside of our router,\nlogical agent? So inside of our router,\nlogical agent? So inside of our router, we're going to say the message type is\nwe're going to say the message type is\nwe're going to say the message type is equal to the\nequal to the\nequal to the state.get and then we're going to get\nstate.get and then we're going to get\nstate.get and then we're going to get the message underscore type or we're\nthe message underscore type or we're\nthe message underscore type or we're going to\ngoing to\ngoing to default to logical. Okay, so if for some\ndefault to logical. Okay, so if for some\ndefault to logical. Okay, so if for some reason the message type didn't get\nreason the message type didn't get\nreason the message type didn't get classified correctly, we're just going\nclassified correctly, we're just going\nclassified correctly, we're just going to go default to the logical route.\nto go default to the logical route.\nto go default to the logical route. Okay. Then what we can do is we can say\nOkay. Then what we can do is we can say\nOkay. Then what we can do is we can say if the message type is emotional then we\nif the message type is emotional then we\nif the message type is emotional then we can return and we can return next and\ncan return and we can return next and\ncan return and we can return next and then therapist. I'm going to show you\nthen therapist. I'm going to show you\nthen therapist. I'm going to show you how this looks in one second because\nhow this looks in one second because\nhow this looks in one second because this isn't currently in our state. And\nthis isn't currently in our state. And\nthis isn't currently in our state. And what's the issue here? We're missing one\nwhat's the issue here? We're missing one\nwhat's the issue here? We're missing one of our quotations. Okay. And then\nof our quotations. Okay. And then\nof our quotations. Okay. And then otherwise we can just return. And this\notherwise we can just return. And this\notherwise we can just return. And this is going to be next and then logical. So\nis going to be next and then logical. So\nis going to be next and then logical. So all we're saying is we want to look at\nall we're saying is we want to look at\nall we're saying is we want to look at our message type in the state. Now if\nour message type in the state. Now if\nour message type in the state. Now if the message type is logical then well we\nthe message type is logical then well we\nthe message type is logical then well we can return logical. Otherwise we're\ncan return logical. Otherwise we're\ncan return logical. Otherwise we're going to return therapist. I'm doing\ngoing to return therapist. I'm doing\ngoing to return therapist. I'm doing this intentionally. We could have just\nthis intentionally. We could have just\nthis intentionally. We could have just used the me message type which you'll\nused the me message type which you'll\nused the me message type which you'll see in a second. But because the message\nsee in a second. But because the message\nsee in a second. But because the message type is different than the next node\ntype is different than the next node\ntype is different than the next node that we want to go to. Um that's kind of\nthat we want to go to. Um that's kind of\nthat we want to go to. Um that's kind of what I'm doing here. I I hope that makes\nwhat I'm doing here. I I hope that makes\nwhat I'm doing here. I I hope that makes a bit a bit of sense. Sorry. But I'm\na bit a bit of sense. Sorry. But I'm\na bit a bit of sense. Sorry. But I'm just adding an additional node just to\njust adding an additional node just to\njust adding an additional node just to add a little bit complexity so you can\nadd a little bit complexity so you can\nadd a little bit complexity so you can kind of see how this works with\nkind of see how this works with\nkind of see how this works with different situations. Okay. So now let's\ndifferent situations. Okay. So now let's\ndifferent situations. Okay. So now let's build out the therapist agent and the\nbuild out the therapist agent and the\nbuild out the therapist agent and the logical agent which will be very\nlogical agent which will be very\nlogical agent which will be very straightforward and all we're going to\nstraightforward and all we're going to\nstraightforward and all we're going to do really is just change kind of the\ndo really is just change kind of the\ndo really is just change kind of the system prompt that we pass to them. So\nsystem prompt that we pass to them. So\nsystem prompt that we pass to them. So same thing we're going to say last\nsame thing we're going to say last\nsame thing we're going to say last message is equal to state messages\nmessage is equal to state messages\nmessage is equal to state messages negative one. Okay we're then going to\nnegative one. Okay we're then going to\nnegative one. Okay we're then going to say the messages that we want to send\nsay the messages that we want to send\nsay the messages that we want to send are going to be the following. We're\nare going to be the following. We're\nare going to be the following. We're going to have a ro which is system.\ngoing to have a ro which is system.\ngoing to have a ro which is system. Okay. And then we're going to have\nOkay. And then we're going to have\nOkay. And then we're going to have content. And for the content I'm just\ncontent. And for the content I'm just\ncontent. And for the content I'm just going to again paste this in. You can\ngoing to again paste this in. You can\ngoing to again paste this in. You can copy this from the link in the\ncopy this from the link in the\ncopy this from the link in the description. I just don't want to waste\ndescription. I just don't want to waste\ndescription. I just don't want to waste the time writing all of it. Okay, so\nthe time writing all of it. Okay, so\nthe time writing all of it. Okay, so there we go. This is our system message.\nthere we go. This is our system message.\nthere we go. This is our system message. It says, \"You are a compassionate\nIt says, \"You are a compassionate\nIt says, \"You are a compassionate therapist. Focus on em emotional aspects\ntherapist. Focus on em emotional aspects\ntherapist. Focus on em emotional aspects of the user's message. Show empathy,\nof the user's message. Show empathy,\nof the user's message. Show empathy, validate their feelings, etc., etc.\"\nvalidate their feelings, etc., etc.\"\nvalidate their feelings, etc., etc.\" Okay, you can do anything that you want\nOkay, you can do anything that you want\nOkay, you can do anything that you want here. Um, but this is just the message\nhere. Um, but this is just the message\nhere. Um, but this is just the message that I'm using for this to make sense.\nthat I'm using for this to make sense.\nthat I'm using for this to make sense. Now, we're going to have another\nNow, we're going to have another\nNow, we're going to have another message. This is going to be rule of\nmessage. This is going to be rule of\nmessage. This is going to be rule of user. And then the content of this\nuser. And then the content of this\nuser. And then the content of this message is going to be the last\nmessage is going to be the last\nmessage is going to be the last message. Okay. Then what we are going to\nmessage. Okay. Then what we are going to\nmessage. Okay. Then what we are going to do is we're going to say the reply is\ndo is we're going to say the reply is\ndo is we're going to say the reply is equal to\nequal to\nequal to llm.invoke on the messages and then we\nllm.invoke on the messages and then we\nllm.invoke on the messages and then we are going to return the following. We're\nare going to return the following. We're\nare going to return the following. We're going to say messages like this with a\ngoing to say messages like this with a\ngoing to say messages like this with a list. We're going to say the\nlist. We're going to say the\nlist. We're going to say the role is the is this uh assistant sorry\nrole is the is this uh assistant sorry\nrole is the is this uh assistant sorry and then the content is going to be\nreply.content. Okay. Now we can\nreply.content. Okay. Now we can literally copy the exact same thing here\nliterally copy the exact same thing here\nliterally copy the exact same thing here and we can put this in our logical\nand we can put this in our logical\nand we can put this in our logical agent. The only difference is we are\nagent. The only difference is we are\nagent. The only difference is we are going to change the uh system message\ngoing to change the uh system message\ngoing to change the uh system message here. Okay. And why is this giving us an\nhere. Okay. And why is this giving us an\nhere. Okay. And why is this giving us an issue? It says duplicated code fragment.\nissue? It says duplicated code fragment.\nissue? It says duplicated code fragment. Okay. That's fine. Don't worry about\nOkay. That's fine. Don't worry about\nOkay. That's fine. Don't worry about that. And we are just going to take this\nthat. And we are just going to take this\nthat. And we are just going to take this new system message. Give me one second\nnew system message. Give me one second\nnew system message. Give me one second here for the logical agent and paste\nhere for the logical agent and paste\nhere for the logical agent and paste this in. So let's go here and paste. And\nthis in. So let's go here and paste. And\nthis in. So let's go here and paste. And it says you are purely logical\nit says you are purely logical\nit says you are purely logical assistant. Focus on only facts and\nassistant. Focus on only facts and\nassistant. Focus on only facts and information. and provide clear, concise\ninformation. and provide clear, concise\ninformation. and provide clear, concise answers based on logic and evidence,\nanswers based on logic and evidence,\nanswers based on logic and evidence, etc., etc. So, again, we can make this a\netc., etc. So, again, we can make this a\netc., etc. So, again, we can make this a reusable function, but same thing, just\nreusable function, but same thing, just\nreusable function, but same thing, just changing the system message. And\nchanging the system message. And\nchanging the system message. And obviously here, you could make like two\nobviously here, you could make like two\nobviously here, you could make like two entirely different agents. We're just\nentirely different agents. We're just\nentirely different agents. We're just making them, you know, kind of simple\nmaking them, you know, kind of simple\nmaking them, you know, kind of simple chat bots with different system prompts.\nchat bots with different system prompts.\nchat bots with different system prompts. All right. So, there we go. We have our\nAll right. So, there we go. We have our\nAll right. So, there we go. We have our messages now. We have our logical agent.\nmessages now. We have our logical agent.\nmessages now. We have our logical agent. We have our therapist agent. We have our\nWe have our therapist agent. We have our\nWe have our therapist agent. We have our router. We have our classify message.\nrouter. We have our classify message.\nrouter. We have our classify message. And now, it is time to actually build\nAnd now, it is time to actually build\nAnd now, it is time to actually build out the graph. So, as we build out the\nout the graph. So, as we build out the\nout the graph. So, as we build out the graph, we're just going to add the nodes\ngraph, we're just going to add the nodes\ngraph, we're just going to add the nodes and edges, which I think is the easy\nand edges, which I think is the easy\nand edges, which I think is the easy part. So, now we're going to say graph\npart. So, now we're going to say graph\npart. So, now we're going to say graph builder add node. I like to start by\nbuilder add node. I like to start by\nbuilder add node. I like to start by adding all of the nodes. So, first we're\nadding all of the nodes. So, first we're\nadding all of the nodes. So, first we're going to say classifier, and this is\ngoing to say classifier, and this is\ngoing to say classifier, and this is going to go to the classify message\ngoing to go to the classify message\ngoing to go to the classify message function. Okay. Next, we can add the\nfunction. Okay. Next, we can add the\nfunction. Okay. Next, we can add the therapist. That's fine. We're just going\ntherapist. That's fine. We're just going\ntherapist. That's fine. We're just going with autocomplete here. We can add\nwith autocomplete here. We can add\nwith autocomplete here. We can add logical. That goes to the logical agent.\nlogical. That goes to the logical agent.\nlogical. That goes to the logical agent. And before that, we can add the router.\nAnd before that, we can add the router.\nAnd before that, we can add the router. Just let me just copy this and change\nJust let me just copy this and change\nJust let me just copy this and change this to say router and the router\nthis to say router and the router\nthis to say router and the router function. Okay. So we have classifier\nfunction. Okay. So we have classifier\nfunction. Okay. So we have classifier router therapist logical. Nice. Now we\nrouter therapist logical. Nice. Now we\nrouter therapist logical. Nice. Now we need to add our edges. So the first edge\nneed to add our edges. So the first edge\nneed to add our edges. So the first edge we can add is with the start. So we can\nwe can add is with the start. So we can\nwe can add is with the start. So we can say graph\nsay graph\nsay graph builder.add\nbuilder.add\nbuilder.add edge. We're going to go start and the\nedge. We're going to go start and the\nedge. We're going to go start and the first one we're going to go to is our\nfirst one we're going to go to is our\nfirst one we're going to go to is our classifier. Okay. So classifier like\nclassifier. Okay. So classifier like\nclassifier. Okay. So classifier like that. Next, we're going to say the graph\nthat. Next, we're going to say the graph\nthat. Next, we're going to say the graph builder add edge. And then we're going\nbuilder add edge. And then we're going\nbuilder add edge. And then we're going to add the edge from the\nto add the edge from the\nto add the edge from the classifier, okay, to the router. Very\nclassifier, okay, to the router. Very\nclassifier, okay, to the router. Very good. Next, rather than just adding a\ngood. Next, rather than just adding a\ngood. Next, rather than just adding a standard edge now, because the router\nstandard edge now, because the router\nstandard edge now, because the router could go to one of two different places,\ncould go to one of two different places,\ncould go to one of two different places, we're going to add a conditional edge.\nwe're going to add a conditional edge.\nwe're going to add a conditional edge. So, we're going to say\nSo, we're going to say\nSo, we're going to say graph, okay, underscorebuilder.add\ngraph, okay, underscorebuilder.add\ngraph, okay, underscorebuilder.add add\nadd\nadd underscore conditional edges. Okay,\nunderscore conditional edges. Okay,\nunderscore conditional edges. Okay, multiple edges here and we're going to\nmultiple edges here and we're going to\nmultiple edges here and we're going to say that we want to go from the router.\nsay that we want to go from the router.\nsay that we want to go from the router. Okay, we're going to have a function\nOkay, we're going to have a function\nOkay, we're going to have a function here which is going to be our condition.\nhere which is going to be our condition.\nhere which is going to be our condition. Okay, so we're going to say lambda and\nOkay, so we're going to say lambda and\nOkay, so we're going to say lambda and this is going to be state and then we're\nthis is going to be state and then we're\nthis is going to be state and then we're going to say\ngoing to say\ngoing to say state.get and then next and then just\nstate.get and then next and then just\nstate.get and then next and then just bear with me here. We're gonna say\nbear with me here. We're gonna say\nbear with me here. We're gonna say therapist, okay, is going to go\ntherapist, okay, is going to go\ntherapist, okay, is going to go to the\nto the\nto the therapist and the logical is going to go\ntherapist and the logical is going to go\ntherapist and the logical is going to go to the logical. Now, I know this is a\nto the logical. Now, I know this is a\nto the logical. Now, I know this is a little bit weird, but essentially what\nlittle bit weird, but essentially what\nlittle bit weird, but essentially what this does or the way this works is we\nthis does or the way this works is we\nthis does or the way this works is we start by defining the source. Then we\nstart by defining the source. Then we\nstart by defining the source. Then we can write a function that we will call\ncan write a function that we will call\ncan write a function that we will call to get a value that we will then match\nto get a value that we will then match\nto get a value that we will then match against this path map. So what I'm doing\nagainst this path map. So what I'm doing\nagainst this path map. So what I'm doing is I'm looking at the state and I'm\nis I'm looking at the state and I'm\nis I'm looking at the state and I'm getting next. Okay. Now the reason we\ngetting next. Okay. Now the reason we\ngetting next. Okay. Now the reason we can do that is because from our router\ncan do that is because from our router\ncan do that is because from our router we return this next value. Now notice\nwe return this next value. Now notice\nwe return this next value. Now notice next is not defined in our state. It's\nnext is not defined in our state. It's\nnext is not defined in our state. It's okay if it's not defined here. It\nokay if it's not defined here. It\nokay if it's not defined here. It doesn't need to be defined here. We can\ndoesn't need to be defined here. We can\ndoesn't need to be defined here. We can still access it afterwards. We just\nstill access it afterwards. We just\nstill access it afterwards. We just haven't typed it correctly. So if we\nhaven't typed it correctly. So if we\nhaven't typed it correctly. So if we wanted to, we could go like next and\nwanted to, we could go like next and\nwanted to, we could go like next and then we could say string or none in our\nthen we could say string or none in our\nthen we could say string or none in our state. But I'm just trying to show you\nstate. But I'm just trying to show you\nstate. But I'm just trying to show you that if you don't have that in the state\nthat if you don't have that in the state\nthat if you don't have that in the state and you return something, you can still\nand you return something, you can still\nand you return something, you can still access this returned value in the next\naccess this returned value in the next\naccess this returned value in the next node. Okay? So that's why I did it this\nnode. Okay? So that's why I did it this\nnode. Okay? So that's why I did it this way just to kind of show you that you\nway just to kind of show you that you\nway just to kind of show you that you don't need to map it in the state, but\ndon't need to map it in the state, but\ndon't need to map it in the state, but it's a good idea to do that. So you can\nit's a good idea to do that. So you can\nit's a good idea to do that. So you can define exactly how it should work, the\ndefine exactly how it should work, the\ndefine exactly how it should work, the type it should be, etc. So we're\ntype it should be, etc. So we're\ntype it should be, etc. So we're returning next. Okay. So here now in our\nreturning next. Okay. So here now in our\nreturning next. Okay. So here now in our conditional edges, we're able to look at\nconditional edges, we're able to look at\nconditional edges, we're able to look at the state. So we say lambda state, this\nthe state. So we say lambda state, this\nthe state. So we say lambda state, this is a function, right? State.get next. We\nis a function, right? State.get next. We\nis a function, right? State.get next. We then get whatever this value is and we\nthen get whatever this value is and we\nthen get whatever this value is and we say okay if the value is therapist we go\nsay okay if the value is therapist we go\nsay okay if the value is therapist we go to therapist. If it's logical we go to\nto therapist. If it's logical we go to\nto therapist. If it's logical we go to logical. But we could change this right\nlogical. But we could change this right\nlogical. But we could change this right if it was one go to therapist. If it's\nif it was one go to therapist. If it's\nif it was one go to therapist. If it's two go to logical or we could have\ntwo go to logical or we could have\ntwo go to logical or we could have different node names which is why we\ndifferent node names which is why we\ndifferent node names which is why we have this kind of path mapping as\nhave this kind of path mapping as\nhave this kind of path mapping as defined here. Okay. So that's our\ndefined here. Okay. So that's our\ndefined here. Okay. So that's our conditional edges. So now we're either\nconditional edges. So now we're either\nconditional edges. So now we're either going to go to therapist or logical from\ngoing to go to therapist or logical from\ngoing to go to therapist or logical from router. Next what we need to do is we\nrouter. Next what we need to do is we\nrouter. Next what we need to do is we need to add the edges. Let me get out of\nneed to add the edges. Let me get out of\nneed to add the edges. Let me get out of this. uh between our therapist and\nthis. uh between our therapist and\nthis. uh between our therapist and logical and the end. So we're going to\nlogical and the end. So we're going to\nlogical and the end. So we're going to say graphuer add edge and we're going to\nsay graphuer add edge and we're going to\nsay graphuer add edge and we're going to go from the therapist not to logical but\ngo from the therapist not to logical but\ngo from the therapist not to logical but to the end. Okay. And then we're going\nto the end. Okay. And then we're going\nto the end. Okay. And then we're going to do the same thing here and we're\nto do the same thing here and we're\nto do the same thing here and we're going to go from\ngoing to go from\ngoing to go from logical to the end. Okay. So we're\nlogical to the end. Okay. So we're\nlogical to the end. Okay. So we're adding edge between therapist and end\nadding edge between therapist and end\nadding edge between therapist and end and logical and end so that we will be\nand logical and end so that we will be\nand logical and end so that we will be able to end the graph. All right. All\nable to end the graph. All right. All\nable to end the graph. All right. All right. So at this point the graph is\nright. So at this point the graph is\nright. So at this point the graph is finished. We can compile the graph and\nfinished. We can compile the graph and\nfinished. We can compile the graph and this will all be working. But the next\nthis will all be working. But the next\nthis will all be working. But the next step is to actually allow us to run\nstep is to actually allow us to run\nstep is to actually allow us to run through the graph and well to utilize\nthrough the graph and well to utilize\nthrough the graph and well to utilize this tool. So let me show you how we do\nthis tool. So let me show you how we do\nthis tool. So let me show you how we do that. We're going to write a simple\nthat. We're going to write a simple\nthat. We're going to write a simple function here called run chatbot. Okay.\nfunction here called run chatbot. Okay.\nfunction here called run chatbot. Okay. Inside of run chatbot we're going to get\nInside of run chatbot we're going to get\nInside of run chatbot we're going to get some initial state. So we're going to\nsome initial state. So we're going to\nsome initial state. So we're going to say state is equal to and we're going to\nsay state is equal to and we're going to\nsay state is equal to and we're going to define our initial state. So we're going\ndefine our initial state. So we're going\ndefine our initial state. So we're going to have messages which is an empty list\nto have messages which is an empty list\nto have messages which is an empty list and we're going to have the message\nand we're going to have the message\nand we're going to have the message underscore type which is going to be\nunderscore type which is going to be\nunderscore type which is going to be none to begin. All right. Then what\nnone to begin. All right. Then what\nnone to begin. All right. Then what we're going to do is we're going to have\nwe're going to do is we're going to have\nwe're going to do is we're going to have a while loop. So we're going to say\na while loop. So we're going to say\na while loop. So we're going to say while true and inside of here we're\nwhile true and inside of here we're\nwhile true and inside of here we're going to get some user input. So we're\ngoing to get some user input. So we're\ngoing to get some user input. So we're going to say user\ngoing to say user\ngoing to say user input is equal to input or we're just\ninput is equal to input or we're just\ninput is equal to input or we're just going to say message like that. All\ngoing to say message like that. All\ngoing to say message like that. All right. Now if the user input so if user\nright. Now if the user input so if user\nright. Now if the user input so if user input is exit then we're just going to\ninput is exit then we're just going to\ninput is exit then we're just going to print by and we are going to break so we\nprint by and we are going to break so we\nprint by and we are going to break so we can get out of the wall while loop uh so\ncan get out of the wall while loop uh so\ncan get out of the wall while loop uh so that we have a way to kind of exit this\nthat we have a way to kind of exit this\nthat we have a way to kind of exit this right okay good so we have our break now\nright okay good so we have our break now\nright okay good so we have our break now after that we're going to say\nafter that we're going to say\nafter that we're going to say state messages and then this is going to\nstate messages and then this is going to\nstate messages and then this is going to be equal to state\nbe equal to state\nbe equal to state get okay messages and then we're going\nget okay messages and then we're going\nget okay messages and then we're going to have an empty list and then we're\nto have an empty list and then we're\nto have an empty list and then we're going to say plus a list and then we're\ngoing to say plus a list and then we're\ngoing to say plus a list and then we're going append the user's message. So\ngoing append the user's message. So\ngoing append the user's message. So we're going to say roll and then user\nwe're going to say roll and then user\nwe're going to say roll and then user and then we're going to say content and\nand then we're going to say content and\nand then we're going to say content and user input. So what we're doing is we're\nuser input. So what we're doing is we're\nuser input. So what we're doing is we're saying okay let's look at the current\nsaying okay let's look at the current\nsaying okay let's look at the current state. Let's try to get the messages if\nstate. Let's try to get the messages if\nstate. Let's try to get the messages if messages does not exist to get an empty\nmessages does not exist to get an empty\nmessages does not exist to get an empty list. And then what we're going to do is\nlist. And then what we're going to do is\nlist. And then what we're going to do is we're just going to add this new message\nwe're just going to add this new message\nwe're just going to add this new message with the ro and the content to our state\nwith the ro and the content to our state\nwith the ro and the content to our state messages. Okay? So that we can kind of\nmessages. Okay? So that we can kind of\nmessages. Okay? So that we can kind of keep doing this continually. Then we're\nkeep doing this continually. Then we're\nkeep doing this continually. Then we're going to say state is equal to graph\ngoing to say state is equal to graph\ngoing to say state is equal to graph do.invoke\ndo.invoke\ndo.invoke invoke with the current state. So what's\ninvoke with the current state. So what's\ninvoke with the current state. So what's going to end up happening here is that\ngoing to end up happening here is that\ngoing to end up happening here is that we're going to get the new state after\nwe're going to get the new state after\nwe're going to get the new state after the graph is invoked and then we're\nthe graph is invoked and then we're\nthe graph is invoked and then we're going to keep using that variable within\ngoing to keep using that variable within\ngoing to keep using that variable within here. So we can kind of keep track of\nhere. So we can kind of keep track of\nhere. So we can kind of keep track of the messages that have been said\nthe messages that have been said\nthe messages that have been said previously and we can keep invoking the\npreviously and we can keep invoking the\npreviously and we can keep invoking the llm. Okay. So then what we're going to\nllm. Okay. So then what we're going to\nllm. Okay. So then what we're going to do down here is we're going to say if\ndo down here is we're going to say if\ndo down here is we're going to say if state.get\nstate.get\nstate.get get messages. Okay. And the len of\nget messages. Okay. And the len of\nget messages. Okay. And the len of state here messages is greater than\nstate here messages is greater than\nstate here messages is greater than zero. So we're just going to make sure\nzero. So we're just going to make sure\nzero. So we're just going to make sure that we do actually have a message\nthat we do actually have a message\nthat we do actually have a message otherwise this code would fail. We're\notherwise this code would fail. We're\notherwise this code would fail. We're going to say last message is equal to\ngoing to say last message is equal to\ngoing to say last message is equal to state messages negative 1 to get the\nstate messages negative 1 to get the\nstate messages negative 1 to get the last message. And then we're simply\nlast message. And then we're simply\nlast message. And then we're simply going to say print and we're going to\ngoing to say print and we're going to\ngoing to say print and we're going to print an fstring. and we're going to say\nprint an fstring. and we're going to say\nprint an fstring. and we're going to say assistant colon and then this is going\nassistant colon and then this is going\nassistant colon and then this is going to be the last\nto be the last\nto be the last message content. Okay. And then down\nmessage content. Okay. And then down\nmessage content. Okay. And then down here we can simply say\nhere we can simply say\nhere we can simply say if_ame is equal to main then run the\nif_ame is equal to main then run the\nif_ame is equal to main then run the chatbot function. Okay. So let's quickly\nchatbot function. Okay. So let's quickly\nchatbot function. Okay. So let's quickly look at this. We have this run chatbot\nlook at this. We have this run chatbot\nlook at this. We have this run chatbot function. Let me just space it out. We\nfunction. Let me just space it out. We\nfunction. Let me just space it out. We start with some initial state. We go\nstart with some initial state. We go\nstart with some initial state. We go into a while while loop sorry. We grab\ninto a while while loop sorry. We grab\ninto a while while loop sorry. We grab the user input. If the user input says\nthe user input. If the user input says\nthe user input. If the user input says exit, we have a way to quit. So we, you\nexit, we have a way to quit. So we, you\nexit, we have a way to quit. So we, you know, print by and we get out of there.\nknow, print by and we get out of there.\nknow, print by and we get out of there. Otherwise, we take this message, we add\nOtherwise, we take this message, we add\nOtherwise, we take this message, we add it to the current state. We then invoke\nit to the current state. We then invoke\nit to the current state. We then invoke the graph using the current state and\nthe graph using the current state and\nthe graph using the current state and then we look at the state after the\nthen we look at the state after the\nthen we look at the state after the invocation and if there's any messages,\ninvocation and if there's any messages,\ninvocation and if there's any messages, we print them out. That's how this\nwe print them out. That's how this\nwe print them out. That's how this works. Okay, so let's run this uh and\nworks. Okay, so let's run this uh and\nworks. Okay, so let's run this uh and see if it functions. If we have any\nsee if it functions. If we have any\nsee if it functions. If we have any errors or not, I'll be amazed if this\nerrors or not, I'll be amazed if this\nerrors or not, I'll be amazed if this runs the first time, but let's give this\nruns the first time, but let's give this\nruns the first time, but let's give this a shot. Okay, so I think uh yeah, it\na shot. Okay, so I think uh yeah, it\na shot. Okay, so I think uh yeah, it says message. So, let's say, hey, I'm\nsays message. So, let's say, hey, I'm\nsays message. So, let's say, hey, I'm really sad right now. and let's see if\nreally sad right now. and let's see if\nreally sad right now. and let's see if it goes to the correct agent here and\nit goes to the correct agent here and\nit goes to the correct agent here and gives us the emotional response. Okay,\ngives us the emotional response. Okay,\ngives us the emotional response. Okay, so I hear you're feeling really sad\nso I hear you're feeling really sad\nso I hear you're feeling really sad right now. That must be really difficult\nright now. That must be really difficult\nright now. That must be really difficult to experience. Would you like to tell me\nto experience. Would you like to tell me\nto experience. Would you like to tell me more about what's going on? I'm here to\nmore about what's going on? I'm here to\nmore about what's going on? I'm here to listen. So that definitely seems like it\nlisten. So that definitely seems like it\nlisten. So that definitely seems like it went to the emotional agent. Let's do\nwent to the emotional agent. Let's do\nwent to the emotional agent. Let's do something like I need some\nsomething like I need some\nsomething like I need some advice. You know, my father would give\nadvice. You know, my father would give\nadvice. You know, my father would give or something. And let's see if it goes\nor something. And let's see if it goes\nor something. And let's see if it goes to the logical agent. Okay, I hear\nto the logical agent. Okay, I hear\nto the logical agent. Okay, I hear you're missing your father's guidance\nyou're missing your father's guidance\nyou're missing your father's guidance right now. Okay, so actually this time\nright now. Okay, so actually this time\nright now. Okay, so actually this time it went to the emotional agent. I guess\nit went to the emotional agent. I guess\nit went to the emotional agent. I guess it doesn't have the same father that I\nit doesn't have the same father that I\nit doesn't have the same father that I had, but let's go. I need some hard\nhad, but let's go. I need some hard\nhad, but let's go. I need some hard solid advice about buying a house or\nsolid advice about buying a house or\nsolid advice about buying a house or something. And let's see if it g goes to\nsomething. And let's see if it g goes to\nsomething. And let's see if it g goes to our uh logical agent this time. Okay,\nour uh logical agent this time. Okay,\nour uh logical agent this time. Okay, give it a second to\ngive it a second to\ngive it a second to run. And here we go. So, logical\nrun. And here we go. So, logical\nrun. And here we go. So, logical requirements, clean title, property. So,\nrequirements, clean title, property. So,\nrequirements, clean title, property. So, definitely seems like, you know, it's\ndefinitely seems like, you know, it's\ndefinitely seems like, you know, it's giving us kind of the in-depth logical\ngiving us kind of the in-depth logical\ngiving us kind of the in-depth logical uh response here. Yeah, here's a logical\nuh response here. Yeah, here's a logical\nuh response here. Yeah, here's a logical analysis for buying a house and our\nanalysis for buying a house and our\nanalysis for buying a house and our agent is working properly. And then\nagent is working properly. And then\nagent is working properly. And then lastly, we can type exit and we can get\nlastly, we can type exit and we can get\nlastly, we can type exit and we can get out of that. Okay, sweet. So that pretty\nout of that. Okay, sweet. So that pretty\nout of that. Okay, sweet. So that pretty much wraps this up. I know that this is\nmuch wraps this up. I know that this is\nmuch wraps this up. I know that this is complicated. There's a lot of code here\ncomplicated. There's a lot of code here\ncomplicated. There's a lot of code here that we wrote, but I wanted to show you\nthat we wrote, but I wanted to show you\nthat we wrote, but I wanted to show you kind of a more advanced use case of\nkind of a more advanced use case of\nkind of a more advanced use case of Langraph because this is complicated,\nLangraph because this is complicated,\nLangraph because this is complicated, right?

However, some\nand deterministic tasks. However, some\nand deterministic tasks. However, some business requirements go way beyond a\nbusiness requirements go way beyond a\nbusiness requirements go way beyond a simple company chatbot. Let's say you're\nsimple company chatbot. Let's say you're\nsimple company chatbot. Let's say you're asked to build a deep research assistant\nasked to build a deep research assistant\nasked to build a deep research assistant software for your company that helps you\nsoftware for your company that helps you\nsoftware for your company that helps you go through large swath of information\ngo through large swath of information\ngo through large swath of information gathered from various sources.

In this case, the use case is a lot more\ncase, the use case is a lot more\ncase, the use case is a lot more complicated than a chatbot and using\ncomplicated than a chatbot and using\ncomplicated than a chatbot and using Langraph will start to make more and\nLangraph will start to make more and\nLangraph will start to make more and more sense. One way to look at it is the\nmore sense. One way to look at it is the\nmore sense. One way to look at it is the threshold from changing from lane chain\nthreshold from changing from lane chain\nthreshold from changing from lane chain to lang graph really comes down to a\nto lang graph really comes down to a\nto lang graph really comes down to a component that's called state graph.\ncomponent that's called state graph.\ncomponent that's called state graph. Essentially when you use state graph you\nEssentially when you use state graph you\nEssentially when you use state graph you have the ability to add what's called\nhave the ability to add what's called\nhave the ability to add what's called nodes and edges. A node is an individual\nnodes and edges. A node is an individual\nnodes and edges. A node is an individual unit of computation. So think of a\nunit of computation.

So let's go back to the\nconditional. So let's go back to the\nconditional. So let's go back to the deep research assistant as an example to\ndeep research assistant as an example to\ndeep research assistant as an example to understand the difference with a little\nunderstand the difference with a little\nunderstand the difference with a little bit more granularity. Let's say the\nbit more granularity. Let's say the\nbit more granularity. Let's say the business requirements for the deep\nbusiness requirements for the deep\nbusiness requirements for the deep research assistant was to first browse\nresearch assistant was to first browse\nresearch assistant was to first browse the web, then find relevant details\nthe web, then find relevant details\nthe web, then find relevant details about a given topic, and let's say the\nabout a given topic, and let's say the\nabout a given topic, and let's say the research requirement was about Tesla's\nresearch requirement was about Tesla's\nresearch requirement was about Tesla's earnings call. And then the assistant\nearnings call. And then the assistant\nearnings call. And then the assistant needs to read and comprehend all new\nneeds to read and comprehend all new\nneeds to read and comprehend all new sources from blogs, forums, research\nsources from blogs, forums, research\nsources from blogs, forums, research papers, and social media. And finally,\npapers, and social media. And finally,\npapers, and social media. And finally, decide if the information contained is\ndecide if the information contained is\ndecide if the information contained is trustworthy and useful. And each source\ntrustworthy and useful.

And the final step for the\ntrustworthy. And the final step for the\ntrustworthy. And the final step for the assistant is to then gather all the\nassistant is to then gather all the\nassistant is to then gather all the credible data and build a report. In\ncredible data and build a report. In\ncredible data and build a report. In traditional software development, you\ntraditional software development, you\ntraditional software development, you not only have to write code that first\nnot only have to write code that first\nnot only have to write code that first fetches a set of links using a search\nfetches a set of links using a search\nfetches a set of links using a search engine API. Second, loop through these\nengine API. Second, loop through these\nengine API. Second, loop through these links manually. Third, scrape the\nlinks manually. Third, scrape the\nlinks manually. Third, scrape the content and feed it to a large language\ncontent and feed it to a large language\ncontent and feed it to a large language model. Four, evaluate the score for each\nmodel. Four, evaluate the score for each\nmodel. Four, evaluate the score for each source. And five, check the score and\nsource. And five, check the score and\nsource. And five, check the score and only use sources that surpasses 75%. And\nonly use sources that surpasses 75%. And\nonly use sources that surpasses 75%. And six, analyze and store these facts into\nsix, analyze and store these facts into\nsix, analyze and store these facts into a report. You not only have to write all\na report. You not only have to write all\na report. You not only have to write all of these code individually but also\nof these code individually but also\nof these code individually but also orchestrate the sequence of how these\norchestrate the sequence of how these\norchestrate the sequence of how these code will run in order to maintain them.\ncode will run in order to maintain them.\ncode will run in order to maintain them. Now with lang graph the steps look a\nNow with lang graph the steps look a\nNow with lang graph the steps look a little bit more streamlined. The entire\nlittle bit more streamlined. The entire\nlittle bit more streamlined. The entire process can be run using a graph where\nprocess can be run using a graph where\nprocess can be run using a graph where each node is responsible for a very\neach node is responsible for a very\neach node is responsible for a very specific task and each edge determines\nspecific task and each edge determines\nspecific task and each edge determines the flow or execution steps. So in our\nthe flow or execution steps. So in our\nthe flow or execution steps. So in our case we need to create nodes for the\ncase we need to create nodes for the\ncase we need to create nodes for the following tasks. First a note to search\nfollowing tasks. First a note to search\nfollowing tasks. First a note to search and gather sources. Second a note to\nand gather sources. Second a note to\nand gather sources. Second a note to scrap and clean content. Third, a node\nscrap and clean content. Third, a node\nscrap and clean content. Third, a node to evaluate trustworthiness using an\nto evaluate trustworthiness using an\nto evaluate trustworthiness using an LLM. Four, a node to extract factual\nLLM. Four, a node to extract factual\nLLM. Four, a node to extract factual statements from the sources. And five, a\nstatements from the sources. And five, a\nstatements from the sources. And five, a node that generates a report. And once\nnode that generates a report. And once\nnode that generates a report. And once all these nodes and edges are configured\nall these nodes and edges are configured\nall these nodes and edges are configured and compiled, Lang graph will\nand compiled, Lang graph will\nand compiled, Lang graph will orchestrate them by executing them based\norchestrate them by executing them based\norchestrate them by executing them based on how it's configured. So for a deep\non how it's configured. So for a deep\non how it's configured. So for a deep research assistant, the graph will look\nresearch assistant, the graph will look\nresearch assistant, the graph will look something like this, where you have the\nsomething like this, where you have the\nsomething like this, where you have the starting node that serves as the entry\nstarting node that serves as the entry\nstarting node that serves as the entry point and all the nodes and edges that\npoint and all the nodes and edges that\npoint and all the nodes and edges that do individual tasks and finally an end\ndo individual tasks and finally an end\ndo individual tasks and finally an end node that terminates the workflow. Now\nnode that terminates the workflow. Now\nnode that terminates the workflow. Now what makes lang graph special is what's\nwhat makes lang graph special is what's\nwhat makes lang graph special is what's called state graph meaning they all have\ncalled state graph meaning they all have\ncalled state graph meaning they all have a shared state. A state essentially\na shared state. A state essentially\na shared state. A state essentially serves as a persistent memory for the\nserves as a persistent memory for the\nserves as a persistent memory for the workflow to store pertinent information\nworkflow to store pertinent information\nworkflow to store pertinent information at all different parts of the workflow.\nat all different parts of the workflow.\nat all different parts of the workflow. So in our case of deep research\nSo in our case of deep research\nSo in our case of deep research assistant the state might look something\nassistant the state might look something\nassistant the state might look something like this. Class research states topic\nlike this. Class research states topic\nlike this. Class research states topic that's a string remaining URLs which is\nthat's a string remaining URLs which is\nthat's a string remaining URLs which is a list of strings. Current URL which is\na list of strings. Current URL which is\na list of strings. Current URL which is an optional string. Content which is an\nan optional string. Content which is an\nan optional string. Content which is an optional string. Current score which is\noptional string. Current score which is\noptional string. Current score which is an optional integer and facts which is a\nan optional integer and facts which is a\nan optional integer and facts which is a list of strings.

Everybody is quite familiar with traditional AI\nis quite familiar with traditional AI\nis quite familiar with traditional AI and now we shall be jumping ahead into\nand now we shall be jumping ahead into\nand now we shall be jumping ahead into agentic AI.\nagentic AI.\nagentic AI. Now, agentic AI is a completely new\nNow, agentic AI is a completely new\nNow, agentic AI is a completely new domain which is definitely related to\ndomain which is definitely related to\ndomain which is definitely related to generative AI because what generative AI\ngenerative AI because what generative AI\ngenerative AI because what generative AI cannot do is something that agentic AI\ncannot do is something that agentic AI\ncannot do is something that agentic AI can do and we will be focusing on this\ncan do and we will be focusing on this\ncan do and we will be focusing on this beautiful library called as langraph.\nbeautiful library called as langraph.\nbeautiful library called as langraph. Till now many of you might have already\nTill now many of you might have already\nTill now many of you might have already known about lang chain. Well, in this\nknown about lang chain. Well, in this\nknown about lang chain. Well, in this series of videos, in this particular\nseries of videos, in this particular\nseries of videos, in this particular module, we will be focusing on agentic\nmodule, we will be focusing on agentic\nmodule, we will be focusing on agentic with langraph. We will first try to\nwith langraph. We will first try to\nwith langraph. We will first try to understand the basic differences between\nunderstand the basic differences between\nunderstand the basic differences between gen AI and traditional AI. Then we will\ngen AI and traditional AI. Then we will\ngen AI and traditional AI. Then we will jump into the differences between gen AI\njump into the differences between gen AI\njump into the differences between gen AI and agent AI. We will try to give a\nand agent AI. We will try to give a\nand agent AI. We will try to give a example scenario based on which we will\nexample scenario based on which we will\nexample scenario based on which we will try to understand what are the different\ntry to understand what are the different\ntry to understand what are the different characteristics of agent AI. Now after\ncharacteristics of agent AI. Now after\ncharacteristics of agent AI. Now after we understand the characteristics of\nwe understand the characteristics of\nwe understand the characteristics of agentic AI, we will try to understand\nagentic AI, we will try to understand\nagentic AI, we will try to understand what are some of the problems\nwhat are some of the problems\nwhat are some of the problems why agentic AI solutions cannot be done\nwhy agentic AI solutions cannot be done\nwhy agentic AI solutions cannot be done by lang chin and why do we need langraph\nby lang chin and why do we need langraph\nby lang chin and why do we need langraph if we already have something called\nif we already have something called\nif we already have something called lang. So all of these things will be\nlang. So all of these things will be\nlang. So all of these things will be covered. Then going forward we will try\ncovered. Then going forward we will try\ncovered. Then going forward we will try to talk a little bit more about langraph\nto talk a little bit more about langraph\nto talk a little bit more about langraph features and various other things\nfeatures and various other things\nfeatures and various other things internal capabilities of langraph. And\ninternal capabilities of langraph. And\ninternal capabilities of langraph. And finally we will be ending this module\nfinally we will be ending this module\nfinally we will be ending this module with a beautiful project not in fact in\nwith a beautiful project not in fact in\nwith a beautiful project not in fact in fact not just one project maybe couple\nfact not just one project maybe couple\nfact not just one project maybe couple of projects\nof projects\nof projects including langraph. it it will be like a\nincluding langraph. it it will be like a\nincluding langraph. it it will be like a agentic AI workflow using multiple AI\nagentic AI workflow using multiple AI\nagentic AI workflow using multiple AI agents using langraph. So without\nagents using langraph. So without\nagents using langraph. So without further ado let's get started with this\nfurther ado let's get started with this\nfurther ado let's get started with this particular module.\nparticular module.\nparticular module. Hi let's begin with our first topic\nHi let's begin with our first topic\nHi let's begin with our first topic which is gen AI versus traditional AI.\nwhich is gen AI versus traditional AI.\nwhich is gen AI versus traditional AI. Now\nNow\nNow theoretically and definition wise I'm\ntheoretically and definition wise I'm\ntheoretically and definition wise I'm not going to explain you for exact\nnot going to explain you for exact\nnot going to explain you for exact bookish definition you can probably\nbookish definition you can probably\nbookish definition you can probably search this term or search this\nsearch this term or search this\nsearch this term or search this particular topic on chat GPT on gro or\nparticular topic on chat GPT on gro or\nparticular topic on chat GPT on gro or any other AI tool. I'm going to try and\nany other AI tool. I'm going to try and\nany other AI tool. I'm going to try and explain you in very simple and layman's\nexplain you in very simple and layman's\nexplain you in very simple and layman's term not the bookish terms. Okay. So\nterm not the bookish terms. Okay. So\nterm not the bookish terms. Okay. So talking about traditional AI, we all\ntalking about traditional AI, we all\ntalking about traditional AI, we all have use cases on machine learning and\nhave use cases on machine learning and\nhave use cases on machine learning and deep learning. If you remember, we used\ndeep learning. If you remember, we used\ndeep learning. If you remember, we used to have a set of data set\nto have a set of data set\nto have a set of data set and we used to train this data set. Of\nand we used to train this data set. Of\nand we used to train this data set. Of course, there are multiple scenarios,\ncourse, there are multiple scenarios,\ncourse, there are multiple scenarios, multiple steps that we usually follow\nmultiple steps that we usually follow\nmultiple steps that we usually follow like feature engineering, feature\nlike feature engineering, feature\nlike feature engineering, feature scaling, blah blah blah blah blah, lot\nscaling, blah blah blah blah blah, lot\nscaling, blah blah blah blah blah, lot of more steps and then the model\nof more steps and then the model\nof more steps and then the model building happens. But what I'm trying to\nbuilding happens. But what I'm trying to\nbuilding happens. But what I'm trying to explain here is initially we were using\nexplain here is initially we were using\nexplain here is initially we were using data and we were trying to\ndata and we were trying to\ndata and we were trying to help the model understand about the\nhelp the model understand about the\nhelp the model understand about the patterns of the data. So the model was\npatterns of the data. So the model was\npatterns of the data. So the model was learning from the historical data and\nlearning from the historical data and\nlearning from the historical data and based on the learning the model used to\nbased on the learning the model used to\nbased on the learning the model used to be able to predict something out of the\nbe able to predict something out of the\nbe able to predict something out of the box. That means when a new customer\nbox. That means when a new customer\nbox. That means when a new customer comes in\ncomes in\ncomes in these are his information. If you of\nthese are his information. If you of\nthese are his information. If you of course if you apply the same steps that\ncourse if you apply the same steps that\ncourse if you apply the same steps that you applied in the model building part\nyou applied in the model building part\nyou applied in the model building part if you apply them and then do a\nif you apply them and then do a\nif you apply them and then do a model.predict the model should be able\nmodel.predict the model should be able\nmodel.predict the model should be able to predict whether this belongs to class\nto predict whether this belongs to class\nto predict whether this belongs to class A or class B. Imagine you are doing a\nA or class B. Imagine you are doing a\nA or class B. Imagine you are doing a fraud detection the model will be able\nfraud detection the model will be able\nfraud detection the model will be able to predict fraud or non-fraud churn\nto predict fraud or non-fraud churn\nto predict fraud or non-fraud churn detection churned or not churned right\ndetection churned or not churned right\ndetection churned or not churned right and so on. So the crux of traditional AI\nand so on. So the crux of traditional AI\nand so on. So the crux of traditional AI is it learns from the historical\nis it learns from the historical\nis it learns from the historical information or past interactions and it\ninformation or past interactions and it\ninformation or past interactions and it is trained on that and it will be able\nis trained on that and it will be able\nis trained on that and it will be able to predict something. talking about\nto predict something. talking about\nto predict something. talking about generative AI. Well, something closer\ngenerative AI. Well, something closer\ngenerative AI. Well, something closer when you when we talk about large\nwhen you when we talk about large\nwhen you when we talk about large language models, these are also some\nlanguage models, these are also some\nlanguage models, these are also some models being trained on some previous\nmodels being trained on some previous\nmodels being trained on some previous data.\ndata.\ndata. But generative AI\nBut generative AI\nBut generative AI basically does the generation part,\nbasically does the generation part,\nbasically does the generation part, right? So if you simply go ahead and ask\nright? So if you simply go ahead and ask\nright? So if you simply go ahead and ask a question to chat GPT\na question to chat GPT\na question to chat GPT well just for your information chat GPT\nwell just for your information chat GPT\nwell just for your information chat GPT is not a large language model it's just\nis not a large language model it's just\nis not a large language model it's just a front-end application of open AAI and\na front-end application of open AAI and\na front-end application of open AAI and the internal models that are being used\nthe internal models that are being used\nthe internal models that are being used are multiple GPT models right now if you\nare multiple GPT models right now if you\nare multiple GPT models right now if you ask a simple question GPT will be able\nask a simple question GPT will be able\nask a simple question GPT will be able to give you an answer\nto give you an answer\nto give you an answer let me tell you what I mean by\nlet me tell you what I mean by\nlet me tell you what I mean by generation question is the answer that\ngeneration question is the answer that\ngeneration question is the answer that you will get. For example, the question\nyou will get. For example, the question\nyou will get. For example, the question is who is Roger Federer?\nis who is Roger Federer?\nis who is Roger Federer? Okay.\nNow, of course, Roger Federer\nNow, of course, Roger Federer information might be there already in\ninformation might be there already in\ninformation might be there already in this brain, right? There might be more\nthis brain, right? There might be more\nthis brain, right? There might be more than 1,000 2,000 lines about Roger\nthan 1,000 2,000 lines about Roger\nthan 1,000 2,000 lines about Roger Federer. Now answer will also come\nFederer. Now answer will also come\nFederer. Now answer will also come something like Roger Federer was a\nsomething like Roger Federer was a\nsomething like Roger Federer was a professional blah blah blah blah blah\nprofessional blah blah blah blah blah\nprofessional blah blah blah blah blah Swiss tennis player blah blah blah blah\nSwiss tennis player blah blah blah blah\nSwiss tennis player blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah right what\nblah blah blah blah blah blah right what\nblah blah blah blah blah blah right what I'm trying to say here is the sentence\nI'm trying to say here is the sentence\nI'm trying to say here is the sentence that is generated as part of the\nthat is generated as part of the\nthat is generated as part of the generative AI model\ngenerative AI model\ngenerative AI model the replica of it will not be present\nthe replica of it will not be present\nthe replica of it will not be present here\nhere\nhere these are all generated information\nthese are all generated information\nthese are all generated information details about Roger Federer will be\ndetails about Roger Federer will be\ndetails about Roger Federer will be present but the exact output word by\npresent but the exact output word by\npresent but the exact output word by word might not be a part of your\nword might not be a part of your\nword might not be a part of your training data set and that's the\ntraining data set and that's the\ntraining data set and that's the capability of generative AI it is able\ncapability of generative AI it is able\ncapability of generative AI it is able to generate\nto generate\nto generate for you what it can generate text it can\nfor you what it can generate text it can\nfor you what it can generate text it can generate image it can generate videos\ngenerate image it can generate videos\ngenerate image it can generate videos for some of the text large language\nfor some of the text large language\nfor some of the text large language models if I talk about open AAI as a\nmodels if I talk about open AAI as a\nmodels if I talk about open AAI as a company multiple GPT models. If I talk\ncompany multiple GPT models. If I talk\ncompany multiple GPT models. If I talk about X, Twitter, Elon Musk, X has its\nabout X, Twitter, Elon Musk, X has its\nabout X, Twitter, Elon Musk, X has its own company called as XAI\nown company called as XAI\nown company called as XAI which has multiple Grock models.

Then we have Anthropic\nhave Anthropic\nhave Anthropic which has cloud set 3.5 blah blah blah\nwhich has cloud set 3.5 blah blah blah\nwhich has cloud set 3.5 blah blah blah 3.7 blah blah blah Deepseek uh Quen,\n3.7 blah blah blah Deepseek uh Quen,\n3.7 blah blah blah Deepseek uh Quen, Noah Pro, Zephier, multiple textual\nNoah Pro, Zephier, multiple textual\nNoah Pro, Zephier, multiple textual models are there. Talking about images,\nmodels are there. Talking about images,\nmodels are there. Talking about images, nowadays many of these models have also\nnowadays many of these models have also\nnowadays many of these models have also been able to generate images as well.\nbeen able to generate images as well.\nbeen able to generate images as well. But very specific image model is a dolly\nBut very specific image model is a dolly\nBut very specific image model is a dolly model or midjourney videos. We have VO\nmodel or midjourney videos. We have VO\nmodel or midjourney videos. We have VO Google VO, we have Sora by OpenAI. So\nGoogle VO, we have Sora by OpenAI. So\nGoogle VO, we have Sora by OpenAI. So these are some of the models which are\nthese are some of the models which are\nthese are some of the models which are able to\nable to\nable to generate. So that's the basic\ngenerate. So that's the basic\ngenerate.

So it basically does everything without your\nbasically does everything without your\nbasically does everything without your human intervention. So things can go out\nhuman intervention. So things can go out\nhuman intervention. So things can go out of control, right? There can be also\nof control, right? There can be also\nof control, right? There can be also scenarios where imagine you have posted\nscenarios where imagine you have posted\nscenarios where imagine you have posted something for hiring a particular\nsomething for hiring a particular\nsomething for hiring a particular candidate for a role and the agentic AI\ncandidate for a role and the agentic AI\ncandidate for a role and the agentic AI bot is basically being biased towards a\nbot is basically being biased towards a\nbot is basically being biased towards a particular nationality or maybe biased\nparticular nationality or maybe biased\nparticular nationality or maybe biased towards somebody's ethnic uh abilities\ntowards somebody's ethnic uh abilities\ntowards somebody's ethnic uh abilities or basically uh is treating cast\nor basically uh is treating cast\nor basically uh is treating cast religion these kind of things which is\nreligion these kind of things which is\nreligion these kind of things which is uh very bad but yeah eventually I'm just\nuh very bad but yeah eventually I'm just\nuh very bad but yeah eventually I'm just giving an example Right. So, can\ngiving an example Right. So, can\ngiving an example Right. So, can autonomy be controlled? That's the first\nautonomy be controlled? That's the first\nautonomy be controlled? That's the first question that I would like to ask.\nquestion that I would like to ask.\nquestion that I would like to ask. Can\nCan\nCan autonomy be controlled?\nautonomy be controlled?\nautonomy be controlled? Yes, it can be controlled. So, let me\nYes, it can be controlled. So, let me\nYes, it can be controlled. So, let me write it down\nwrite it down\nwrite it down few things based on which autonomy can\nfew things based on which autonomy can\nfew things based on which autonomy can be controlled. So, sorry,\nbe controlled. So, sorry,\nbe controlled. So, sorry, let me write it down. The very first\nlet me write it down. The very first\nlet me write it down. The very first thing that I want to write here is\npermission scope.\npermission scope. Permission scope. What does that mean?\nPermission scope. What does that mean?\nPermission scope. What does that mean? That basically means that we should\nThat basically means that we should\nThat basically means that we should limit what tools or actions the agent\nlimit what tools or actions the agent\nlimit what tools or actions the agent can perform independently.\ncan perform independently.\ncan perform independently.

So basically you should allow users to\nSo basically you should allow users to\nSo basically you should allow users to stop, pause or kind of change the agents\nstop, pause or kind of change the agents\nstop, pause or kind of change the agents behavior at any time. So for example,\nbehavior at any time. So for example,\nbehavior at any time.

Now for example, if you want the agent, the AI agent not to conduct\nagent, the AI agent not to conduct\nagent, the AI agent not to conduct interviews on weekends\ninterviews on weekends\ninterviews on weekends or maybe you only want to hire somebody\nor maybe you only want to hire somebody\nor maybe you only want to hire somebody from India or let's say you only want to\nfrom India or let's say you only want to\nfrom India or let's say you only want to hire somebody with 2 to four years\nhire somebody with 2 to four years\nhire somebody with 2 to four years experience with a strict experience\nexperience with a strict experience\nexperience with a strict experience knowledge on Python. Now these are some\nknowledge on Python. Now these are some\nknowledge on Python. Now these are some policies that you need to set or else\npolicies that you need to set or else\npolicies that you need to set or else the agent will not be able to\nthe agent will not be able to\nthe agent will not be able to understand. Right?\nWhat can be risky? There are multiple\nWhat can be risky? There are multiple things that can be risky. Right? If I\nthings that can be risky. Right? If I\nthings that can be risky. Right? If I talk about let's say if you give full\ntalk about let's say if you give full\ntalk about let's say if you give full control or full autonomy to the agent,\ncontrol or full autonomy to the agent,\ncontrol or full autonomy to the agent, what will happen? Let's say the job\nwhat will happen? Let's say the job\nwhat will happen? Let's say the job offer roll out\nwithout the human intervention or maybe\nwithout the human intervention or maybe shortlisting.\nWhile shortlisting the agent could be\nWhile shortlisting the agent could be biased. I don't want to write anything.\nbiased. I don't want to write anything.\nbiased. I don't want to write anything. It could be biased on anything, right?\nIt could be biased on anything, right?\nIt could be biased on anything, right?

And the third could be extra spending on\nAnd the third could be extra spending on\nAnd the third could be extra spending on ads.\nads.\nads. You are setting something but your bot\nYou are setting something but your bot\nYou are setting something but your bot is going to use more. So there can be\nis going to use more. So there can be\nis going to use more. So there can be multiple things that can go wrong and\nmultiple things that can go wrong and\nmultiple things that can go wrong and that can be controlled as well. Well,\nthat can be controlled as well. Well,\nthat can be controlled as well. Well, jumping into the practicals, we will be\njumping into the practicals, we will be\njumping into the practicals, we will be showing you how to use autonomy\nshowing you how to use autonomy\nshowing you how to use autonomy properly.\nproperly.\nproperly. The next one is goal oriented.\nLet's try to talk about goal oriented.\nLet's try to talk about goal oriented. What do you mean by goal oriented? Goal\nWhat do you mean by goal oriented? Goal\nWhat do you mean by goal oriented? Goal oriented is one of the key principles or\noriented is one of the key principles or\noriented is one of the key principles or key characteristics of an AI agent\nkey characteristics of an AI agent\nkey characteristics of an AI agent because the very main task is the goal\nbecause the very main task is the goal\nbecause the very main task is the goal and AI agents\ngoal is to accomplish this goal. I mean\ngoal is to accomplish this goal. I mean AI agent's task is to accomplish this\nAI agent's task is to accomplish this\nAI agent's task is to accomplish this goal.\ngoal.\ngoal. Now what can what what is our goal in\nNow what can what what is our goal in\nNow what can what what is our goal in this example? to hire a back-end\nthis example? to hire a back-end\nthis example? to hire a back-end engineer of 2 to four years experience.\nengineer of 2 to four years experience.\nengineer of 2 to four years experience. Right?\nSo basically\nSo basically your goal can actually have a\nyour goal can actually have a\nyour goal can actually have a constraint, right? It can have a\nconstraint, right? It can have a\nconstraint, right? It can have a constraint that the candidate should be\nconstraint that the candidate should be\nconstraint that the candidate should be from India or or maybe uh spend your ads\nfrom India or or maybe uh spend your ads\nfrom India or or maybe uh spend your ads not more than $100 per day. These are\nnot more than $100 per day. These are\nnot more than $100 per day. These are all constraints.\nall constraints.\nall constraints. Or maybe you want just a Python\nOr maybe you want just a Python\nOr maybe you want just a Python developer. Right? So basically what I'm\ndeveloper. Right? So basically what I'm\ndeveloper. Right? So basically what I'm trying to say is\ntrying to say is\ntrying to say is you can have constraints can have\nyou can have constraints can have\nyou can have constraints can have constraints.\nOkay. The second point is goal is always\nOkay. The second point is goal is always stored in the core memory.\nstored in the core memory.\nstored in the core memory. Okay. Now let's say I'm just simply\nOkay. Now let's say I'm just simply\nOkay. Now let's say I'm just simply writing down a JSON. What is my main\nwriting down a JSON. What is my main\nwriting down a JSON. What is my main goal? My main goal, let's say, is to\ngoal? My main goal, let's say, is to\ngoal? My main goal, let's say, is to hire an engineer.\nhire an engineer.\nhire an engineer. And then what are the constraints?\nAnd then what are the constraints?\nAnd then what are the constraints? The constants are experience\nThe constants are experience\nThe constants are experience 2 to 4\n2 to 4\n2 to 4 scales,\nscales,\nscales, Python\nPython\nPython and uh location\nactive. This is just a dummy a dummy\nactive. This is just a dummy a dummy JSON, right? It's like a concept how\nJSON, right? It's like a concept how\nJSON, right? It's like a concept how goal is basically stored in the core\ngoal is basically stored in the core\ngoal is basically stored in the core memory, right? And goals can also be\nmemory, right? And goals can also be\nmemory, right? And goals can also be altered. Imagine you have a goal today.\naltered. Imagine you have a goal today.\naltered. Imagine you have a goal today. You can alter it. Goals can be altered.\nYou can alter it. Goals can be altered.\nYou can alter it. Goals can be altered. That's basically the second key\nThat's basically the second key\nThat's basically the second key characteristics of your AI agent.\nPlanning. Let's try to talk about\nPlanning. Let's try to talk about planning.\nWhat is planning? First of all, planning\nWhat is planning? First of all, planning is basically the agent's ability to\nis basically the agent's ability to\nis basically the agent's ability to break down a highle goal\nbreak down a highle goal\nbreak down a highle goal into a structured sequence of actions\ninto a structured sequence of actions\ninto a structured sequence of actions sequence of actions\nsequence of actions\nsequence of actions or sub goals\nor sub goals\nor sub goals and then decide the best path to achieve\nand then decide the best path to achieve\nand then decide the best path to achieve it. That's basically called as planning,\nit. That's basically called as planning,\nit. That's basically called as planning, right? You know what your goal is, but\nright? You know what your goal is, but\nright? You know what your goal is, but there are multiple plans.\nthere are multiple plans.\nthere are multiple plans. Plan A, plan B, plan C. There could be\nPlan A, plan B, plan C. There could be\nPlan A, plan B, plan C. There could be more which can help you achieve this\nmore which can help you achieve this\nmore which can help you achieve this goal. You need to find the most\ngoal. You need to find the most\ngoal. You need to find the most optimized way and the most optimized\noptimized way and the most optimized\noptimized way and the most optimized costing based on which you can achieve\ncosting based on which you can achieve\ncosting based on which you can achieve this goal. Right? And that is achieved\nthis goal. Right? And that is achieved\nthis goal. Right? And that is achieved using planning. So in planning the very\nusing planning. So in planning the very\nusing planning. So in planning the very first step is to generate multiple\nfirst step is to generate multiple\nfirst step is to generate multiple candidate plans. Generate\ncandidate plans. What does that mean?\ncandidate plans. What does that mean? Let's say my plan A is\nLet's say my plan A is\nLet's say my plan A is post jobs on LinkedIn\nor glass door.\nor glass door. etc. My plan B might not be this one. It\netc. My plan B might not be this one. It\netc. My plan B might not be this one. It might be reaching out to head hunters\nmight be reaching out to head hunters\nmight be reaching out to head hunters for profiles.\nfor profiles.\nfor profiles. My plan C could be just going through\nMy plan C could be just going through\nMy plan C could be just going through maybe there is some noer pro or maybe a\nmaybe there is some noer pro or maybe a\nmaybe there is some noer pro or maybe a third party which can actually give me a\nthird party which can actually give me a\nthird party which can actually give me a list of multiple candidates that are\nlist of multiple candidates that are\nlist of multiple candidates that are just you know accomplishing the goal or\njust you know accomplishing the goal or\njust you know accomplishing the goal or maybe fulfilling the requirements or the\nmaybe fulfilling the requirements or the\nmaybe fulfilling the requirements or the constraints right something like that.\nconstraints right something like that.\nconstraints right something like that. Step number two is evaluate each plant.\nStep number two is evaluate each plant.\nStep number two is evaluate each plant. Evaluate each plan. What does that mean?\nEvaluate each plan. What does that mean?\nEvaluate each plan. What does that mean? Based on efficiency\nwhich is better. We don't know. We need\nwhich is better. We don't know. We need to evaluate tool availability.\nWhich tools are suitable? We don't know\nWhich tools are suitable? We don't know right. Cost very important\nright. Cost very important\nright. Cost very important characteristics. Does it require premium\ncharacteristics. Does it require premium\ncharacteristics. Does it require premium tools or what will be the cost involved?\ntools or what will be the cost involved?\ntools or what will be the cost involved? What is the risk involved?\nWhat is the risk involved?\nWhat is the risk involved? Will it fail if we get no applicants?\nWill it fail if we get no applicants?\nWill it fail if we get no applicants? Right? So these are multiple things\nRight? So these are multiple things\nRight? So these are multiple things based on which you evaluate each plan.\nbased on which you evaluate each plan.\nbased on which you evaluate each plan. And the third point and the last point\nAnd the third point and the last point\nAnd the third point and the last point is selecting the best plan.\nis selecting the best plan.\nis selecting the best plan. best plan\nbest plan\nbest plan with the help of\nwith the help of\nwith the help of human in the loop and if not a\nhuman in the loop and if not a\nhuman in the loop and if not a pre-programmed\nNow for example if you ask a question\nNow for example if you ask a question which options do you prefer and the\nwhich options do you prefer and the\nwhich options do you prefer and the human in the loop will be able to help\nhuman in the loop will be able to help\nhuman in the loop will be able to help and tell option A or a pre-programmed\nand tell option A or a pre-programmed\nand tell option A or a pre-programmed policy maybe the bot is going to ask\npolicy maybe the bot is going to ask\npolicy maybe the bot is going to ask these are the three options for you to\nthese are the three options for you to\nthese are the three options for you to book a flight ticket\nbook a flight ticket\nbook a flight ticket as there is no confirmation or no human\nas there is no confirmation or no human\nas there is no confirmation or no human involved it will directly go ahead and\ninvolved it will directly go ahead and\ninvolved it will directly go ahead and book the cheapest one right so that\nbook the cheapest one right so that\nbook the cheapest one right so that could be achieved using a pre-programmed\ncould be achieved using a pre-programmed\ncould be achieved using a pre-programmed and policy.\nTalking about our next key\nTalking about our next key characteristics is\nreasoning. We already went through\nreasoning. We already went through planning. Now we have reasoning. Now try\nplanning. Now we have reasoning. Now try\nplanning. Now we have reasoning. Now try to understand this thing. See agentic AI\nto understand this thing. See agentic AI\nto understand this thing. See agentic AI clearly has a goal, right? And goal can\nclearly has a goal, right? And goal can\nclearly has a goal, right? And goal can be accomplished by two things. One is\nbe accomplished by two things. One is\nbe accomplished by two things. One is planning,\nplanning,\nplanning, one is execution.\nRight? I have just summed up how to\nRight? I have just summed up how to achieve your goal.\nachieve your goal.\nachieve your goal. Now you can have reasoning here. You can\nNow you can have reasoning here. You can\nNow you can have reasoning here. You can also have reasoning here. Right? So\nalso have reasoning here. Right? So\nalso have reasoning here. Right? So simply if I have to uh tell you what the\nsimply if I have to uh tell you what the\nsimply if I have to uh tell you what the definition of reasoning is, it's like a\ndefinition of reasoning is, it's like a\ndefinition of reasoning is, it's like a cognitive\ncognitive\ncognitive process through which agentic AI\nprocess through which agentic AI\nprocess through which agentic AI interprets\ninterprets\ninterprets information\nuh draws conclusion\nuh draws conclusion and make decisions\nand make decisions\nand make decisions both\nwhile planning\nwhile planning plus execution.\nplus execution.\nplus execution. That's basically your reasoning. Okay.\nThat's basically your reasoning. Okay.\nThat's basically your reasoning. Okay. Now, if I talk about planning, let's say\nNow, if I talk about planning, let's say\nNow, if I talk about planning, let's say I explicitly want to talk about\nI explicitly want to talk about\nI explicitly want to talk about planning.\nSorry, what was that? Uh cognitive\nSorry, what was that? Uh cognitive process through which agent and make\nprocess through which agent and make\nprocess through which agent and make decisions both while planning and\ndecisions both while planning and\ndecisions both while planning and execution. worthwhile planning and\nexecution. worthwhile planning and\nexecution. worthwhile planning and execution.\nLet me make it black. Yeah. Now talking\nLet me make it black. Yeah. Now talking about the next thing which is let's say\nabout the next thing which is let's say\nabout the next thing which is let's say I just want to focus more on planning\nI just want to focus more on planning\nI just want to focus more on planning and then we'll talk about execution. So\nand then we'll talk about execution. So\nand then we'll talk about execution. So planning majorly has three steps.\nplanning majorly has three steps.\nplanning majorly has three steps. One is goal decomposition.\nOkay. What is goal decomposition? It\nOkay. What is goal decomposition? It basically means you are\nbasically means you are\nbasically means you are defining your goals into steps and sub\ndefining your goals into steps and sub\ndefining your goals into steps and sub goals.\ngoals.\ngoals. The next one is tool selection.\nHow do we select tools?\nHow do we select tools? Which tool for which step?\nWhich tool for which step?\nWhich tool for which step? Which tool\nWhich tool\nWhich tool for which step?\nfor which step?\nfor which step? The third one is resource estimation.\nWhat do you mean by resource estimation?\nWhat do you mean by resource estimation? It's basically estimating your\nIt's basically estimating your\nIt's basically estimating your estimating your time, your money\nestimating your time, your money\nestimating your time, your money dependencies,\nrisks.\nrisks. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now talking about execution.\nNow talking about execution.\nNow talking about execution. Execution also has three steps. One is\nExecution also has three steps. One is\nExecution also has three steps. One is decision making.\nThe second way is is human in the loop\nThe second way is is human in the loop and the third one is error handling.\nAnd these three are important in the\nAnd these three are important in the execution where you're actually\nexecution where you're actually\nexecution where you're actually implementing decision making. What does\nimplementing decision making. What does\nimplementing decision making. What does that mean? Which option to choose?\nthat mean? Which option to choose?\nthat mean? Which option to choose? Right? Imagine you have three candidates\nRight? Imagine you have three candidates\nRight? Imagine you have three candidates and three of them are matching, right?\nand three of them are matching, right?\nand three of them are matching, right? So what to do? How do we select? That's\nSo what to do? How do we select? That's\nSo what to do? How do we select? That's decision making. Human in the loop\ndecision making. Human in the loop\ndecision making. Human in the loop basically\nit can basically tell you when to pause,\nit can basically tell you when to pause, what to do, what not to do, ask for\nwhat to do, what not to do, ask for\nwhat to do, what not to do, ask for help, these kind of things. And error\nhelp, these kind of things. And error\nhelp, these kind of things. And error handling lastly is uh basically\nhandling lastly is uh basically\nhandling lastly is uh basically interpreting tool.\nInterpreting tool or APIs\nInterpreting tool or APIs uh failure and recovery\nand that's pretty much all about the\nand that's pretty much all about the hi let's talk about the next step which\nhi let's talk about the next step which\nhi let's talk about the next step which is adaptability.\nNow this is one of the steps which is\nNow this is one of the steps which is very easy to understand that\nvery easy to understand that\nvery easy to understand that adaptability is nothing but the ability\nadaptability is nothing but the ability\nadaptability is nothing but the ability to adapt right now agents\nto adapt right now agents\nto adapt right now agents agents quality basically agents\nagents quality basically agents\nagents quality basically agents uh quality is to adapt right it's very\nuh quality is to adapt right it's very\nuh quality is to adapt right it's very simple\nsimple\nsimple as human beings also we adapt agents\nas human beings also we adapt agents\nas human beings also we adapt agents will also adapt so in simp in in other\nwill also adapt so in simp in in other\nwill also adapt so in simp in in other words adapting is basically ally nothing\nwords adapting is basically ally nothing\nwords adapting is basically ally nothing but modifying your plans, strategies or\nbut modifying your plans, strategies or\nbut modifying your plans, strategies or actions.

Short-term memory are basically your active sessions.\nyour active sessions.\nyour active sessions. That means within a particular session,\nThat means within a particular session,\nThat means within a particular session, whatever the chat is happening that's in\nwhatever the chat is happening that's in\nwhatever the chat is happening that's in your short-term memory,\nyour short-term memory,\nyour short-term memory, the context,\nthe recent messages,\nthe recent messages, these are all part of your short-term\nthese are all part of your short-term\nthese are all part of your short-term memory. And talking about long-term\nmemory. And talking about long-term\nmemory. And talking about long-term memory, your goal,\nmemory, your goal,\nmemory, your goal, past interactions,\npast interactions,\npast interactions, these are all your long-term memory,\nthese are all your long-term memory,\nthese are all your long-term memory, etc.\netc.\netc. And lastly, we have the supervisor. Who\nAnd lastly, we have the supervisor. Who\nAnd lastly, we have the supervisor. Who is the supervisor? It's basically the\nis the supervisor? It's basically the\nis the supervisor? It's basically the human.\nhuman.\nhuman. The human in the loop is basically\nThe human in the loop is basically\nThe human in the loop is basically called as the supervisor. Let me write\ncalled as the supervisor. Let me write\ncalled as the supervisor. Let me write it down here itself. In the same page,\nit down here itself. In the same page,\nit down here itself. In the same page, we have supervisor.\nhuman in the loop.\nhuman in the loop. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. So, agent\nSo, agent\nSo, agent plus\nplus\nplus the human.\nWhat are the different activities that\nWhat are the different activities that we do? Let me write it down here. I\nwe do? Let me write it down here. I\nwe do? Let me write it down here. I think it's visible properly. Approval or\nthink it's visible properly. Approval or\nthink it's visible properly. Approval or rejections,\nrequests.\nrequests. The second one is guardrails.\nThe second one is guardrails.\nThe second one is guardrails. So implementing guardrails policies.\nSo implementing guardrails policies.\nSo implementing guardrails policies. This is where humans also\nThis is where humans also\nThis is where humans also come into consideration. And then we\ncome into consideration. And then we\ncome into consideration. And then we have the edge case\nhave the edge case\nhave the edge case escalation.\nescalation.\nescalation. Sorry, uh sorry about my handwriting.\nSorry, uh sorry about my handwriting.\nSorry, uh sorry about my handwriting. Let me write it down. Edge case\nLet me write it down. Edge case\nLet me write it down. Edge case escalation.\nescalation.\nescalation. This is pretty much understood, right?\nThis is pretty much understood, right?\nThis is pretty much understood, right? uh that means you are basically taking\nuh that means you are basically taking\nuh that means you are basically taking the\nthe\nthe human's intervention for approval of a\nhuman's intervention for approval of a\nhuman's intervention for approval of a particular step right we have three\nparticular step right we have three\nparticular step right we have three candidates should we go ahead for the\ncandidates should we go ahead for the\ncandidates should we go ahead for the interviews then you have to say yes then\ninterviews then you have to say yes then\ninterviews then you have to say yes then only the LLM will be able to call a tool\nonly the LLM will be able to call a tool\nonly the LLM will be able to call a tool and schedule an interview guardrails and\nand schedule an interview guardrails and\nand schedule an interview guardrails and approvals are again very easy to\napprovals are again very easy to\napprovals are again very easy to understand these are some of the\nunderstand these are some of the\nunderstand these are some of the constraints that we have to provide so\nconstraints that we have to provide so\nconstraints that we have to provide so that the LLM can handle\nthat the LLM can handle\nthat the LLM can handle For example, in hiring, I dedicatedly\nFor example, in hiring, I dedicatedly\nFor example, in hiring, I dedicatedly need somebody from India but sorry, he\nneed somebody from India but sorry, he\nneed somebody from India but sorry, he should be remote. Yeah, these these can\nshould be remote. Yeah, these these can\nshould be remote. Yeah, these these can be set in the guard rules and policies.\nbe set in the guard rules and policies.\nbe set in the guard rules and policies. The third one is edge case escalation.\nThe third one is edge case escalation.\nThe third one is edge case escalation. For example, I want to have a rule\nFor example, I want to have a rule\nFor example, I want to have a rule specific for\nspecific for\nspecific for having NITs or IIT students.\nhaving NITs or IIT students.\nhaving NITs or IIT students. But\nBut\nBut if there is any other\nif there is any other\nif there is any other university student who is also really\nuniversity student who is also really\nuniversity student who is also really really good then the agent can basically\nreally good then the agent can basically\nreally good then the agent can basically alert us.\nalert us.\nalert us. So it should not only\nSo it should not only\nSo it should not only stick to the guardrails or the policies\nstick to the guardrails or the policies\nstick to the guardrails or the policies defined. It can also alert us some other\ndefined. It can also alert us some other\ndefined. It can also alert us some other candidates who are non nits, nonIT\ncandidates who are non nits, nonIT\ncandidates who are non nits, nonIT maybe from VIT or any other colleges but\nmaybe from VIT or any other colleges but\nmaybe from VIT or any other colleges but the candidates profile is good that can\nthe candidates profile is good that can\nthe candidates profile is good that can also be done. So these are the various\nalso be done. So these are the various\nalso be done. So these are the various components that\ncomponents that\ncomponents that are part of your agent.\nIn the next video we shall try to talk\nIn the next video we shall try to talk about the differences between Langchen\nabout the differences between Langchen\nabout the differences between Langchen and Langraph and going forward we have\nand Langraph and going forward we have\nand Langraph and going forward we have many other topics to talk about.\nmany other topics to talk about.\nmany other topics to talk about. Hi welcome back to this video. Well in\nHi welcome back to this video. Well in\nHi welcome back to this video. Well in this video we are getting started with\nthis video we are getting started with\nthis video we are getting started with an agentic AI workflow. So this is\nan agentic AI workflow. So this is\nan agentic AI workflow. So this is basically like a dummy project you can\nbasically like a dummy project you can\nbasically like a dummy project you can call and of course we will be using\ncall and of course we will be using\ncall and of course we will be using langraph.\nlangraph.\nlangraph. We will also be using lang chain because\nWe will also be using lang chain because\nWe will also be using lang chain because that's also important but majorly our\nthat's also important but majorly our\nthat's also important but majorly our agentic framework will be created using\nagentic framework will be created using\nagentic framework will be created using langraph.\nlangraph.\nlangraph. Now what exactly is this use case? Let\nNow what exactly is this use case? Let\nNow what exactly is this use case? Let me try to explain you. Well, I am going\nme try to explain you. Well, I am going\nme try to explain you. Well, I am going to create an application\nwhere I am going to use a large language\nwhere I am going to use a large language model. In our case, I'm going to use\nmodel. In our case, I'm going to use\nmodel. In our case, I'm going to use Grock 4.\nGrock 4.\nGrock 4. Of course, I will need an API key for\nOf course, I will need an API key for\nOf course, I will need an API key for that. In case you are not comfortable\nthat. In case you are not comfortable\nthat. In case you are not comfortable using Grock, you can always switch back\nusing Grock, you can always switch back\nusing Grock, you can always switch back to any other model. Let's say Olama\nto any other model. Let's say Olama\nto any other model. Let's say Olama model or something. Well, I will show\nmodel or something. Well, I will show\nmodel or something. Well, I will show you how to switch over to different\nyou how to switch over to different\nyou how to switch over to different models in case you are interested in\nmodels in case you are interested in\nmodels in case you are interested in that. And then I will be having two\nthat. And then I will be having two\nthat. And then I will be having two different tools. So let's say I'm going\ndifferent tools. So let's say I'm going\ndifferent tools. So let's say I'm going to write down as tool number one and\nto write down as tool number one and\nto write down as tool number one and tool number two.\ntool number two.\ntool number two. So what is my tool number one? Tool\nSo what is my tool number one? Tool\nSo what is my tool number one? Tool number one is going to be a currency\nnumber one is going to be a currency\nnumber one is going to be a currency conversion\nconversion\nconversion currency exchange\ncurrency exchange\ncurrency exchange API\nAPI\nAPI and my tool number two is going to be a\nand my tool number two is going to be a\nand my tool number two is going to be a weather API.\nNow eventually as we have two different\nNow eventually as we have two different tools we can actually consider this as\ntools we can actually consider this as\ntools we can actually consider this as our first agent and this as our second\nour first agent and this as our second\nour first agent and this as our second agent and this entire workflow can be\nagent and this entire workflow can be\nagent and this entire workflow can be considered as a agentic workflow. I hope\nconsidered as a agentic workflow. I hope\nconsidered as a agentic workflow. I hope everybody is aware of these concepts,\neverybody is aware of these concepts,\neverybody is aware of these concepts, right? Whenever we do a LLM call, LLM is\nright? Whenever we do a LLM call, LLM is\nright? Whenever we do a LLM call, LLM is acting and basically doing a tool\nacting and basically doing a tool\nacting and basically doing a tool calling that together is called as an AI\ncalling that together is called as an AI\ncalling that together is called as an AI agent, right? And when you combine\nagent, right? And when you combine\nagent, right? And when you combine multiple AI agent in a particular\nmultiple AI agent in a particular\nmultiple AI agent in a particular workflow, basically we call it as an\nworkflow, basically we call it as an\nworkflow, basically we call it as an agent AI framework, right? Um before\nagent AI framework, right? Um before\nagent AI framework, right? Um before getting into the practicals I would also\ngetting into the practicals I would also\ngetting into the practicals I would also like to talk about one minor concept\nlike to talk about one minor concept\nlike to talk about one minor concept which is workflows right for those who\nwhich is workflows right for those who\nwhich is workflows right for those who are unaware of workflows. Now workflows\nare unaware of workflows. Now workflows\nare unaware of workflows. Now workflows are majorly of two types I mean it's\nare majorly of two types I mean it's\nare majorly of two types I mean it's like a refresher to what you might\nlike a refresher to what you might\nlike a refresher to what you might already know. So let me quickly refresh\nalready know. So let me quickly refresh\nalready know. So let me quickly refresh your mind and then we will directly jump\nyour mind and then we will directly jump\nyour mind and then we will directly jump into the practicals. Right. So workflows\ninto the practicals. Right. So workflows\ninto the practicals. Right. So workflows are usually of two types, right? One of\nare usually of two types, right? One of\nare usually of two types, right? One of them could be sequential,\nokay? And one of them could be\nokay? And one of them could be non-sequential.\nWhenever you want to build a sequential\nWhenever you want to build a sequential workflow, for example, you have like a\nworkflow, for example, you have like a\nworkflow, for example, you have like a prompt,\nprompt,\nprompt, you are calling the large language model\nyou are calling the large language model\nyou are calling the large language model and the LLM is responding something. You\nand the LLM is responding something. You\nand the LLM is responding something. You have another prompt again LLM is\nhave another prompt again LLM is\nhave another prompt again LLM is responding something or summarizing it.\nresponding something or summarizing it.\nresponding something or summarizing it. And then you have the output parser.\nAnd then you have the output parser.\nAnd then you have the output parser. Output parser basically to give the\nOutput parser basically to give the\nOutput parser basically to give the output. Now here the execution is step\noutput. Now here the execution is step\noutput. Now here the execution is step by step from left to right.\nby step from left to right.\nby step from left to right. Okay. In case there is a need of human\nOkay. In case there is a need of human\nOkay. In case there is a need of human interval\ninterval\ninterval here I would need a human in the loop.\nhere I would need a human in the loop.\nhere I would need a human in the loop. Now there will be a problem here if I\nNow there will be a problem here if I\nNow there will be a problem here if I have a human in the loop here right\nhave a human in the loop here right\nhave a human in the loop here right especially when we are implementing\nespecially when we are implementing\nespecially when we are implementing something in lang chain because lang\nsomething in lang chain because lang\nsomething in lang chain because lang chains usually are made for sequential\nchains usually are made for sequential\nchains usually are made for sequential flows right because the main concept\nflows right because the main concept\nflows right because the main concept there is chain now nonsequential flows\nthere is chain now nonsequential flows\nthere is chain now nonsequential flows are something like this right you are\nare something like this right you are\nare something like this right you are dealing with different nodes\ndealing with different nodes\ndealing with different nodes and you have different loops and based\nand you have different loops and based\nand you have different loops and based on that you will be enacting now in\non that you will be enacting now in\non that you will be enacting now in order to have such complex workflow\norder to have such complex workflow\norder to have such complex workflow which is a non-sequential workflow we\nwhich is a non-sequential workflow we\nwhich is a non-sequential workflow we usually go ahead with langraph right\nusually go ahead with langraph right\nusually go ahead with langraph right here lang chain will not work so in this\nhere lang chain will not work so in this\nhere lang chain will not work so in this particular project I'm going to use lang\nparticular project I'm going to use lang\nparticular project I'm going to use lang graph\nespecially for the agenti part that does\nespecially for the agenti part that does not mean that I'm not going to use lang\nnot mean that I'm not going to use lang\nnot mean that I'm not going to use lang chain I will also use lang chain because\nchain I will also use lang chain because\nchain I will also use lang chain because lang chain is also needed in order to\nlang chain is also needed in order to\nlang chain is also needed in order to create some you know chains or even uh\ncreate some you know chains or even uh\ncreate some you know chains or even uh in order to call some tool calling. So\nin order to call some tool calling. So\nin order to call some tool calling. So we will be needing that library as well.\nwe will be needing that library as well.\nwe will be needing that library as well. So jumping into this particular code\nSo jumping into this particular code\nSo jumping into this particular code well this code is already a wcoded\nwell this code is already a wcoded\nwell this code is already a wcoded project which basically means I have\nproject which basically means I have\nproject which basically means I have written down the entire code by the AI.\nwritten down the entire code by the AI.\nwritten down the entire code by the AI. It's it's basically not written by me.\nIt's it's basically not written by me.\nIt's it's basically not written by me. It's a AI written code. But I'm going to\nIt's a AI written code. But I'm going to\nIt's a AI written code. But I'm going to explain you this code line by line or\nexplain you this code line by line or\nexplain you this code line by line or block by block and then I will also help\nblock by block and then I will also help\nblock by block and then I will also help you out with understanding on the major\nyou out with understanding on the major\nyou out with understanding on the major parts of it. Okay. So to get started\nparts of it. Okay. So to get started\nparts of it. Okay. So to get started with we can install all these things\nwith we can install all these things\nwith we can install all these things lang xai because I'm going to use x\nlang xai because I'm going to use x\nlang xai because I'm going to use x aisai's API langchain community\naisai's API langchain community\naisai's API langchain community langchain requests and langraph. Right.\nlangchain requests and langraph. Right.\nlangchain requests and langraph. Right. So once my installation is done let me\nSo once my installation is done let me\nSo once my installation is done let me just show you how this code works. a\njust show you how this code works. a\njust show you how this code works. a brief idea about this code that I have\nbrief idea about this code that I have\nbrief idea about this code that I have two functions which is convert currency\ntwo functions which is convert currency\ntwo functions which is convert currency and get weather current weather\nand get weather current weather\nand get weather current weather and if you scroll through you can see\nand if you scroll through you can see\nand if you scroll through you can see that yeah this is where I'm calling my\nthat yeah this is where I'm calling my\nthat yeah this is where I'm calling my model lang uh llm model this is where\nmodel lang uh llm model this is where\nmodel lang uh llm model this is where I've created the agent nodes and then\nI've created the agent nodes and then\nI've created the agent nodes and then should we continue or not and this is\nshould we continue or not and this is\nshould we continue or not and this is where I have created the entire graph\nwhere I have created the entire graph\nwhere I have created the entire graph right So\nright So\nright So if you look at this piece of code, well\nif you look at this piece of code, well\nif you look at this piece of code, well as I told you, I will again be\nas I told you, I will again be\nas I told you, I will again be explaining this entire code line by line\nexplaining this entire code line by line\nexplaining this entire code line by line or at least block by block uh shortly.\nor at least block by block uh shortly.\nor at least block by block uh shortly. But um if you ask me that\nif you look at this particular workflow\nif you look at this particular workflow right you can see we have add nodes we\nright you can see we have add nodes we\nright you can see we have add nodes we have edges and [snorts] then we have\nhave edges and [snorts] then we have\nhave edges and [snorts] then we have some conditional edges right so quickly\nsome conditional edges right so quickly\nsome conditional edges right so quickly what are nodes what are edges basically\nwhat are nodes what are edges basically\nwhat are nodes what are edges basically in agentic AI if you have something like\nin agentic AI if you have something like\nin agentic AI if you have something like this\nthis\nthis these are called as nodes and these are\nthese are called as nodes and these are\nthese are called as nodes and these are called as edges This\ncalled as edges This\ncalled as edges This and conditional edges are those things\nand conditional edges are those things\nand conditional edges are those things where you have uh where you are having\nwhere you have uh where you are having\nwhere you have uh where you are having like a yes or no block. That means you\nlike a yes or no block. That means you\nlike a yes or no block. That means you want to have some conditions. If yes,\nwant to have some conditions. If yes,\nwant to have some conditions. If yes, then do this. If no, then do this.\nthen do this. If no, then do this.\nthen do this. If no, then do this. Something like that. Right? So if you\nSomething like that. Right? So if you\nSomething like that. Right? So if you look at this piece of code especially\nlook at this piece of code especially\nlook at this piece of code especially this part where we are creating the\nthis part where we are creating the\nthis part where we are creating the state graph and till here\nstate graph and till here\nstate graph and till here how does the tree looks like how does\nhow does the tree looks like how does\nhow does the tree looks like how does the graph looks like let me try to draw\nthe graph looks like let me try to draw\nthe graph looks like let me try to draw that\nthat\nthat okay so I'll just so first one is agent\nokay so I'll just so first one is agent\nokay so I'll just so first one is agent so let's say I will draw my\nflowchart something like this We have a\nflowchart something like this We have a start button. Then we have an agent\nstart button. Then we have an agent\nstart button. Then we have an agent node.\nnode.\nnode. Okay. Uh this basically the LLM decides\nright. And then we have tools. So there\nright. And then we have tools. So there are uh like a node that is called as\nare uh like a node that is called as\nare uh like a node that is called as tools. Right? Now this basically is your\ntools. Right? Now this basically is your\ntools. Right? Now this basically is your agent node.\nOkay.\nOkay. After your agent node, then we have the\nAfter your agent node, then we have the\nAfter your agent node, then we have the tool node. So agent decides and let's\ntool node. So agent decides and let's\ntool node. So agent decides and let's say I'm going to do a two diversion.\nsay I'm going to do a two diversion.\nsay I'm going to do a two diversion. Let's say we have some tool calls\nLet's say we have some tool calls\nLet's say we have some tool calls or we might not have some tool calls,\nor we might not have some tool calls,\nor we might not have some tool calls, right?\nYou can see this one the conditional\nYou can see this one the conditional edge, right? The agent node.\nedge, right? The agent node.\nedge, right? The agent node. Okay. Uh let let me try to explain it so\nOkay. Uh let let me try to explain it so\nOkay. Uh let let me try to explain it so that it is understood properly. So so\nthat it is understood properly. So so\nthat it is understood properly. So so there are three nodes right agent tools\nthere are three nodes right agent tools\nthere are three nodes right agent tools and summarize. Okay. So agent\nand summarize. Okay. So agent\nand summarize. Okay. So agent tools and summarize right but I have not\ntools and summarize right but I have not\ntools and summarize right but I have not drawn any edges. The first edge here is\ndrawn any edges. The first edge here is\ndrawn any edges. The first edge here is between start and agent. So you can see\nbetween start and agent. So you can see\nbetween start and agent. So you can see between start and agent we have the\nbetween start and agent we have the\nbetween start and agent we have the first edge.\nfirst edge.\nfirst edge. Cool. So the red ones are the edge,\nCool. So the red ones are the edge,\nCool. So the red ones are the edge, right?\nright?\nright? Then we have the second edge between\nThen we have the second edge between\nThen we have the second edge between tools and agents.\ntools and agents.\ntools and agents. But before the edge,\nBut before the edge,\nBut before the edge, we have this conditional edge. Okay? Now\nwe have this conditional edge. Okay? Now\nwe have this conditional edge. Okay? Now conditional edge, we all know\nconditional edge, we all know\nconditional edge, we all know conditional edge is basically for\nconditional edge is basically for\nconditional edge is basically for conditions, right? So from age end, we\nconditions, right? So from age end, we\nconditions, right? So from age end, we have this should continue or not. Should\nhave this should continue or not. Should\nhave this should continue or not. Should continue or end. Now if I go to this\ncontinue or end. Now if I go to this\ncontinue or end. Now if I go to this particular function you can see that\nparticular function you can see that\nparticular function you can see that here we have this uh uh so it's\nhere we have this uh uh so it's\nhere we have this uh uh so it's basically like this one. So has tools.\nbasically like this one. So has tools.\nbasically like this one. So has tools. Yeah. And if no no tools or sorry\nif you have no tool calls no tool calls\nif you have no tool calls no tool calls then end of the loop. Okay. And if you\nthen end of the loop. Okay. And if you\nthen end of the loop. Okay. And if you have tools then you are basically\nhave tools then you are basically\nhave tools then you are basically calling the tools.\nThen you have this edge tools and agent.\nThen you have this edge tools and agent. So that that's already done. Agent and\nSo that that's already done. Agent and\nSo that that's already done. Agent and tools. We have this edge. Let me just\ntools. We have this edge. Let me just\ntools. We have this edge. Let me just write it down in in red. That's the edge\nwrite it down in in red. That's the edge\nwrite it down in in red. That's the edge you have between agent and tools. Right?\nyou have between agent and tools. Right?\nyou have between agent and tools. Right? So that's pretty much it. And then this\nSo that's pretty much it. And then this\nSo that's pretty much it. And then this is like a loop. So we have to run this\nis like a loop. So we have to run this\nis like a loop. So we have to run this loop unless and until somebody is\nloop unless and until somebody is\nloop unless and until somebody is exiting or closing it. Right? It's a\nexiting or closing it. Right? It's a\nexiting or closing it. Right? It's a very simple graphical representation.\nvery simple graphical representation.\nvery simple graphical representation. Let me try to uh simplify and tell you\nLet me try to uh simplify and tell you\nLet me try to uh simplify and tell you what exactly it's going to do. Right? As\nwhat exactly it's going to do. Right? As\nwhat exactly it's going to do. Right? As a user, whenever you are going to ask a\na user, whenever you are going to ask a\na user, whenever you are going to ask a question,\nquestion,\nquestion, let's say you're going to ask a question\nlet's say you're going to ask a question\nlet's say you're going to ask a question about a general question. Let's say how\nabout a general question. Let's say how\nabout a general question. Let's say how are you or who are you? Right?\nare you or who are you? Right?\nare you or who are you? Right? Now, in this case, it will not do a tool\nNow, in this case, it will not do a tool\nNow, in this case, it will not do a tool call. Well, it will go into this\ncall. Well, it will go into this\ncall. Well, it will go into this direction, but it will not do a tool\ndirection, but it will not do a tool\ndirection, but it will not do a tool call. it will just directly call the LLM\ncall. it will just directly call the LLM\ncall. it will just directly call the LLM brain and answer it. But let's say the\nbrain and answer it. But let's say the\nbrain and answer it. But let's say the question is what is 100 USD to INR. Now\nquestion is what is 100 USD to INR. Now\nquestion is what is 100 USD to INR. Now here it will identify that I need to\nhere it will identify that I need to\nhere it will identify that I need to call the tool. So it will call tool\ncall the tool. So it will call tool\ncall the tool. So it will call tool number one. Right? And then it will\nnumber one. Right? And then it will\nnumber one. Right? And then it will revert back whatever it is 100 USD is\nrevert back whatever it is 100 USD is\nrevert back whatever it is 100 USD is going to be 100 multiplied with\ngoing to be 100 multiplied with\ngoing to be 100 multiplied with something something INR. Right? Now if\nsomething something INR. Right? Now if\nsomething something INR. Right? Now if you ask a question something like how is\nyou ask a question something like how is\nyou ask a question something like how is the weather in Osaka? Right? whether in\nthe weather in Osaka? Right? whether in\nthe weather in Osaka? Right? whether in Osaka. Now it knows that it will be\nOsaka. Now it knows that it will be\nOsaka. Now it knows that it will be calling the tool number two and it will\ncalling the tool number two and it will\ncalling the tool number two and it will answer and this particular loop goes in\nanswer and this particular loop goes in\nanswer and this particular loop goes in till the time you say by or exit.\ntill the time you say by or exit.\ntill the time you say by or exit. Basically you are exiting the flow.\nBasically you are exiting the flow.\nBasically you are exiting the flow. Okay, this is the simplest explanation\nOkay, this is the simplest explanation\nOkay, this is the simplest explanation of this particular agentic AI workflow.\nof this particular agentic AI workflow.\nof this particular agentic AI workflow. Let's try to run this and show you how\nLet's try to run this and show you how\nLet's try to run this and show you how exactly it works and then we will have a\nexactly it works and then we will have a\nexactly it works and then we will have a code walk through in the next video.\ncode walk through in the next video.\ncode walk through in the next video. Right. So first question I'm going to\nRight. So first question I'm going to\nRight. So first question I'm going to ask who are you?\nask who are you?\nask who are you? Now this has nothing to do with tool\nNow this has nothing to do with tool\nNow this has nothing to do with tool calling.\ncalling.\ncalling. Probably we can add a new um loop here.\nProbably we can add a new um loop here.\nProbably we can add a new um loop here. For example, instead of agent and loop,\nFor example, instead of agent and loop,\nFor example, instead of agent and loop, what we can do is it identifies the\nwhat we can do is it identifies the\nwhat we can do is it identifies the tool, which tool to call,\nwhich tool, tool one or tool two or just\nwhich tool, tool one or tool two or just call the LLM. And based on that\ncall the LLM. And based on that\ncall the LLM. And based on that and based on that\nand based on that\nand based on that there will be a loop\nthere will be a loop\nthere will be a loop and whenever there is the loop end or\nand whenever there is the loop end or\nand whenever there is the loop end or the user is ending it there will be an\nthe user is ending it there will be an\nthe user is ending it there will be an end that will be the indent for flow.\nend that will be the indent for flow.\nend that will be the indent for flow. Okay. So I'm a helpful AI assistant\nOkay. So I'm a helpful AI assistant\nOkay. So I'm a helpful AI assistant specialized in currency conversions and\nspecialized in currency conversions and\nspecialized in currency conversions and weather updates. Let's say how will be\nweather updates. Let's say how will be\nweather updates. Let's say how will be the weather\nthe weather\nthe weather in Osaka?\nin Osaka?\nin Osaka? Okay, let's say what is the weather in\nOkay, let's say what is the weather in\nOkay, let's say what is the weather in Osaka now?\nSo here it's\nSo here it's basically going and understanding that I\nbasically going and understanding that I\nbasically going and understanding that I need to call the weather API and it will\nneed to call the weather API and it will\nneed to call the weather API and it will be able to call the weather API and it's\nbe able to call the weather API and it's\nbe able to call the weather API and it's responding. The agent is responding. The\nresponding. The agent is responding. The\nresponding. The agent is responding. The current weather in Osaka is 14° C. Feels\ncurrent weather in Osaka is 14° C. Feels\ncurrent weather in Osaka is 14° C. Feels like 14° C. Clear, humid, blah, blah,\nlike 14° C. Clear, humid, blah, blah,\nlike 14° C. Clear, humid, blah, blah, blah. Okay. So, I hope that is clear.\nOkay. Uh, and you can see the final\nOkay. Uh, and you can see the final output is here, right? The current\noutput is here, right? The current\noutput is here, right? The current weather in Osaka is this. Now let's say\nweather in Osaka is this. Now let's say\nweather in Osaka is this. Now let's say can you convert\ncan you convert\ncan you convert 180 K INR to B.\nNow here it will be identifying that I\nNow here it will be identifying that I need to call the first token uh first\nneed to call the first token uh first\nneed to call the first token uh first tool and here it will be calling the\ntool and here it will be calling the\ntool and here it will be calling the first tool and it will be giving you the\nfirst tool and it will be giving you the\nfirst tool and it will be giving you the output. So this is basically the direct\noutput. So this is basically the direct\noutput. So this is basically the direct API output but you can see it is still\nAPI output but you can see it is still\nAPI output but you can see it is still running executing. So the API output\nrunning executing. So the API output\nrunning executing. So the API output will be going to the LLM and LLM will\nwill be going to the LLM and LLM will\nwill be going to the LLM and LLM will give you a final answer something like\ngive you a final answer something like\ngive you a final answer something like this right textual answer you can see\nthis right textual answer you can see\nthis right textual answer you can see this much INR is equal to this much\nthis much INR is equal to this much\nthis much INR is equal to this much exchange equals to this so let's try to\nexchange equals to this so let's try to\nexchange equals to this so let's try to finish it I think uh we need to do exit\nfinish it I think uh we need to do exit\nfinish it I think uh we need to do exit and no not exit\nand no not exit\nand no not exit I think we need to call buy or\nI think we need to call buy or\nI think we need to call buy or something.\nYeah, just try to exit. That's it. Okay.\nYeah, just try to exit. That's it. Okay. Not with the parenthesis. Now you can\nNot with the parenthesis. Now you can\nNot with the parenthesis. Now you can see that this is how this agenti\nsee that this is how this agenti\nsee that this is how this agenti workflow looks like. Very basic agenti\nworkflow looks like. Very basic agenti\nworkflow looks like. Very basic agenti workflow. We are using grock APIs. Um\nworkflow. We are using grock APIs. Um\nworkflow. We are using grock APIs. Um how do we change it to? It's very\nhow do we change it to? It's very\nhow do we change it to? It's very simple. In case you want to change it to\nsimple. In case you want to change it to\nsimple. In case you want to change it to AMA, it's just literally uh twoline code\nAMA, it's just literally uh twoline code\nAMA, it's just literally uh twoline code change. That's it. Instead of X AI,\nchange. That's it. Instead of X AI,\nchange. That's it. Instead of X AI, where is that XAI?\nSo instead of this you just have to\nSo instead of this you just have to sorry\nimport chatma that's it and then you\nimport chatma that's it and then you just have to change it to chatma here\njust have to change it to chatma here\njust have to change it to chatma here and change the model and whichever model\nand change the model and whichever model\nand change the model and whichever model you want to use for example in my case\nyou want to use for example in my case\nyou want to use for example in my case let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say is already installed and I already have\nis already installed and I already have\nis already installed and I already have couple of models available able which is\ncouple of models available able which is\ncouple of models available able which is tiny lama which is a 1.1 billion\ntiny lama which is a 1.1 billion\ntiny lama which is a 1.1 billion parameter model. We also have llama 3.2\nparameter model. We also have llama 3.2\nparameter model. We also have llama 3.2 which is a 3 billion parameter model.\nwhich is a 3 billion parameter model.\nwhich is a 3 billion parameter model. Now let's say in case I want to use this\nNow let's say in case I want to use this\nNow let's say in case I want to use this I will just have to change it here. And\nI will just have to change it here. And\nI will just have to change it here. And then I don't need the API keys. And\nthen I don't need the API keys. And\nthen I don't need the API keys. And that's pretty much it. If you want to\nthat's pretty much it. If you want to\nthat's pretty much it. If you want to change the temperature you can change\nchange the temperature you can change\nchange the temperature you can change the temperature. And that's pretty much\nthe temperature. And that's pretty much\nthe temperature. And that's pretty much it right. Uh yeah and and your code is\nit right. Uh yeah and and your code is\nit right. Uh yeah and and your code is ready. Just in case you want to use\nready. Just in case you want to use\nready. Just in case you want to use open-source models without using the\nopen-source models without using the\nopen-source models without using the APIs. In case you want to use APIs and\nAPIs. In case you want to use APIs and\nAPIs. In case you want to use APIs and you don't want to use a grog API, then\nyou don't want to use a grog API, then\nyou don't want to use a grog API, then what you can do is you can simply change\nwhat you can do is you can simply change\nwhat you can do is you can simply change this. Let's say you want to use an open\nthis. Let's say you want to use an open\nthis. Let's say you want to use an open AI API, you just have to change it to\nAI API, you just have to change it to\nAI API, you just have to change it to open AI. That's it. And chat open AAI.\nopen AI. That's it. And chat open AAI.\nopen AI. That's it. And chat open AAI. See all these things are very easy to do\nSee all these things are very easy to do\nSee all these things are very easy to do these days because nowadays the AI tools\nthese days because nowadays the AI tools\nthese days because nowadays the AI tools that we have like charg\nthat we have like charg\nthat we have like charg these kind of tools they are competent\nthese kind of tools they are competent\nthese kind of tools they are competent enough to generate codes. So you take\nenough to generate codes. So you take\nenough to generate codes. So you take the code and just ask that you know\nthe code and just ask that you know\nthe code and just ask that you know let's say sorry instead of\nlet's say sorry instead of\nlet's say sorry instead of this let's say instead of lama I want to\nthis let's say instead of lama I want to\nthis let's say instead of lama I want to call open AI can you write down the code\ncall open AI can you write down the code\ncall open AI can you write down the code it will write down the code for you so\nit will write down the code for you so\nit will write down the code for you so it's very simple right chat openai uh if\nit's very simple right chat openai uh if\nit's very simple right chat openai uh if I want to use anthropic\nI want to use anthropic\nI want to use anthropic cloud set 3.5 5 API\ncloud set 3.5 5 API\ncloud set 3.5 5 API change the code.\nchange the code.\nchange the code. So whichever model you want to use you\nSo whichever model you want to use you\nSo whichever model you want to use you can change it right and if you want to\ncan change it right and if you want to\ncan change it right and if you want to change it to hugging face that also you\nchange it to hugging face that also you\nchange it to hugging face that also you can do. So it's completely your call.\ncan do. So it's completely your call.\ncan do. So it's completely your call. This is just a demo project that we have\nThis is just a demo project that we have\nThis is just a demo project that we have created. However, I'm going to explain\ncreated.

Hi, welcome back. So in the previous\nHi, welcome back. So in the previous\nHi, welcome back. So in the previous videos we already talked about\nvideos we already talked about\nvideos we already talked about that we have created an agentic AI\nthat we have created an agentic AI\nthat we have created an agentic AI framework or a workflow where we have\nframework or a workflow where we have\nframework or a workflow where we have two tools. Tool number one for currency\ntwo tools. Tool number one for currency\ntwo tools. Tool number one for currency conversion\nand tool number two for weather APIs.\nand tool number two for weather APIs. So basically when you have created the\nSo basically when you have created the\nSo basically when you have created the chatbot\nchatbot\nchatbot it's expecting users question\nit's expecting users question\nit's expecting users question the large language model is able to\nthe large language model is able to\nthe large language model is able to interpret\ninterpret\ninterpret the intent and the question and it is\nthe intent and the question and it is\nthe intent and the question and it is able to redirect it into\nable to redirect it into\nable to redirect it into one of these tools.\none of these tools.\none of these tools. If you are asking a general question\nIf you are asking a general question\nIf you are asking a general question which has nothing to do with the tools,\nwhich has nothing to do with the tools,\nwhich has nothing to do with the tools, it's basically calling its own brain and\nit's basically calling its own brain and\nit's basically calling its own brain and then it is giving you an output\nthen it is giving you an output\nthen it is giving you an output something like that. Right? So to get\nsomething like that. Right? So to get\nsomething like that. Right? So to get started with\nthe text tag that we are using in this\nthe text tag that we are using in this project\nproject\nproject very simple\nvery simple\nvery simple we are using lang graph\nwe are using lang graph\nwe are using lang graph for the agenti workflow and we are using\nfor the agenti workflow and we are using\nfor the agenti workflow and we are using lang chain for model model building not\nlang chain for model model building not\nlang chain for model model building not the model building model calling model\nthe model building model calling model\nthe model building model calling model calling tool calling and these kind of\ncalling tool calling and these kind of\ncalling tool calling and these kind of things okay um that's it so let's try to\nthings okay um that's it so let's try to\nthings okay um that's it so let's try to deep dive into the code and I'm going to\ndeep dive into the code and I'm going to\ndeep dive into the code and I'm going to explain you each and everything about\nexplain you each and everything about\nexplain you each and everything about the code. uh because in the previous\nthe code. uh because in the previous\nthe code. uh because in the previous videos we just touched paste right. So\nvideos we just touched paste right. So\nvideos we just touched paste right. So this is the project code that we have\nthis is the project code that we have\nthis is the project code that we have used initially we have installed all\nused initially we have installed all\nused initially we have installed all these libraries. So maybe as you are\nthese libraries. So maybe as you are\nthese libraries. So maybe as you are using Google collab it's always\nusing Google collab it's always\nusing Google collab it's always recommended to reinstall it whenever you\nrecommended to reinstall it whenever you\nrecommended to reinstall it whenever you need it. So in my case I'm reinstalling\nneed it. So in my case I'm reinstalling\nneed it. So in my case I'm reinstalling it and then let's go ahead with the\nit and then let's go ahead with the\nit and then let's go ahead with the code. So the initial blocks of code are\ncode. So the initial blocks of code are\ncode. So the initial blocks of code are very simple. These are all import\nvery simple. These are all import\nvery simple. These are all import statements. As you can see we are using\nstatements. As you can see we are using\nstatements. As you can see we are using two things which is langchen core and\ntwo things which is langchen core and\ntwo things which is langchen core and langraph right. Langchen core is\nlangraph right. Langchen core is\nlangraph right. Langchen core is basically for calling the tools\nbasically for calling the tools\nbasically for calling the tools messages. Now what are these messages?\nmessages. Now what are these messages?\nmessages. Now what are these messages? AI message human message. What are these\nAI message human message. What are these\nAI message human message. What are these things? So AI message is basically that\nthings? So AI message is basically that\nthings? So AI message is basically that kind of a message. Let me just write it\nkind of a message. Let me just write it\nkind of a message. Let me just write it down. AI message is basically a message\ndown. AI message is basically a message\ndown. AI message is basically a message that is generated by the AI system.\nthat is generated by the AI system.\nthat is generated by the AI system. Okay. So often providing responses or\nOkay. So often providing responses or\nOkay. So often providing responses or information based on user input. Talking\ninformation based on user input. Talking\ninformation based on user input. Talking about human message, if we go ahead and\nabout human message, if we go ahead and\nabout human message, if we go ahead and check where have we used a human\ncheck where have we used a human\ncheck where have we used a human message. Let's say human message. So we\nmessage. Let's say human message. So we\nmessage. Let's say human message. So we have used somewhere here, right? For\nhave used somewhere here, right? For\nhave used somewhere here, right? For example, if the length of the messages\nexample, if the length of the messages\nexample, if the length of the messages are greater than 12, the summary message\nare greater than 12, the summary message\nare greater than 12, the summary message is something like this. Da da da da da.\nis something like this. Da da da da da.\nis something like this. Da da da da da. And then new summary prompt. Here we are\nAnd then new summary prompt. Here we are\nAnd then new summary prompt. Here we are joining the content\njoining the content\njoining the content and here we are passing the human\nand here we are passing the human\nand here we are passing the human message. Right? So basically human\nmessage. Right? So basically human\nmessage. Right? So basically human message is whatever is sent by the user\nmessage is whatever is sent by the user\nmessage is whatever is sent by the user because this is where the human in the\nbecause this is where the human in the\nbecause this is where the human in the loop comes into picture. Right? Whatever\nloop comes into picture. Right? Whatever\nloop comes into picture. Right? Whatever the message sent by the user typically\nthe message sent by the user typically\nthe message sent by the user typically um kind of inquiring or responding to\num kind of inquiring or responding to\num kind of inquiring or responding to the AI system. Whatever AI is asking the\nthe AI system. Whatever AI is asking the\nthe AI system. Whatever AI is asking the human is responding it back. System\nhuman is responding it back. System\nhuman is responding it back. System message. I think everybody knows these\nmessage. I think everybody knows these\nmessage. I think everybody knows these are the messages that convey about the\nare the messages that convey about the\nare the messages that convey about the system status, capabilities, errors. Now\nsystem status, capabilities, errors. Now\nsystem status, capabilities, errors. Now these are not AI generated or user\nthese are not AI generated or user\nthese are not AI generated or user generated. Okay, let me see where we\ngenerated. Okay, let me see where we\ngenerated. Okay, let me see where we have used system message or do we\nhave used system message or do we\nhave used system message or do we yeah system message.\nyeah system message.\nyeah system message. Yeah, this is just a system message that\nYeah, this is just a system message that\nYeah, this is just a system message that we are calling when we are invoking the\nwe are calling when we are invoking the\nwe are calling when we are invoking the tools. Then we have the tool message\ntools. Then we have the tool message\ntools. Then we have the tool message that tool specific message. So messages\nthat tool specific message. So messages\nthat tool specific message. So messages related to the specific tools or\nrelated to the specific tools or\nrelated to the specific tools or functions being used within the system\nfunctions being used within the system\nfunctions being used within the system often providing outputs or results from\noften providing outputs or results from\noften providing outputs or results from those tools. So these are basically the\nthose tools. So these are basically the\nthose tools. So these are basically the tool outputs. For example, whenever you\ntool outputs. For example, whenever you\ntool outputs. For example, whenever you are invoking the tool, right?\nare invoking the tool, right?\nare invoking the tool, right? You can see\nYou can see\nYou can see whenever you are invoking the tool. So\nwhenever you are invoking the tool. So\nwhenever you are invoking the tool. So for example, here what's happening is\nfor example, here what's happening is\nfor example, here what's happening is this is the main block, right? Here\nthis is the main block, right? Here\nthis is the main block, right? Here if your instance is an instance tool\nif your instance is an instance tool\nif your instance is an instance tool message then you can you're basically\nmessage then you can you're basically\nmessage then you can you're basically calling the tool show the tools usage\ncalling the tool show the tools usage\ncalling the tool show the tools usage plus the result right this is the main\nplus the result right this is the main\nplus the result right this is the main function and then we have remove message\nfunction and then we have remove message\nfunction and then we have remove message which is like that deletes a particular\nwhich is like that deletes a particular\nwhich is like that deletes a particular message from the conversation anyways\nmessage from the conversation anyways\nmessage from the conversation anyways these are different messages if you are\nthese are different messages if you are\nthese are different messages if you are still confused and want a proper\nstill confused and want a proper\nstill confused and want a proper explanation you can always take help of\nexplanation you can always take help of\nexplanation you can always take help of AI wipe coding using which you can\nAI wipe coding using which you can\nAI wipe coding using which you can understand more about it. Right? These\nunderstand more about it. Right? These\nunderstand more about it. Right? These are runnables. Runnable config. Here we\nare runnables. Runnable config. Here we\nare runnables. Runnable config. Here we are defining the langraph graph. As lang\nare defining the langraph graph. As lang\nare defining the langraph graph. As lang graph is a stateful orchestration. We\ngraph is a stateful orchestration. We\ngraph is a stateful orchestration. We have state graph start and end. Start\nhave state graph start and end. Start\nhave state graph start and end. Start and end is basically the start and the\nand end is basically the start and the\nand end is basically the start and the end block. It all starts with the start\nend block. It all starts with the start\nend block. It all starts with the start block. And then let's say you are\nblock. And then let's say you are\nblock. And then let's say you are initiating an add node. let's say the\ninitiating an add node. let's say the\ninitiating an add node. let's say the first node\nfirst node\nfirst node then you are adding the second node\nthen you are adding the second node\nthen you are adding the second node let's say then you have like a\nlet's say then you have like a\nlet's say then you have like a conditional statement or something like\nconditional statement or something like\nconditional statement or something like that and then you have few other details\nthat and then you have few other details\nthat and then you have few other details and then you have the end node that is\nand then you have the end node that is\nand then you have the end node that is exactly how a lang graph architecture\nexactly how a lang graph architecture\nexactly how a lang graph architecture looks like\nlooks like\nlooks like okay uh so for that we have used this\nokay uh so for that we have used this\nokay uh so for that we have used this and then lang graph pre-built tool node\nand then lang graph pre-built tool node\nand then lang graph pre-built tool node and tools condition and this is like a\nand tools condition and this is like a\nand tools condition and this is like a Memory saver checkpoint. Okay. So to get\nMemory saver checkpoint. Okay. So to get\nMemory saver checkpoint. Okay. So to get started with as you can see that we have\nstarted with as you can see that we have\nstarted with as you can see that we have our first tool which is convert\nour first tool which is convert\nour first tool which is convert currency. Okay.\nWhat are the inputs to it? The inputs to\nWhat are the inputs to it? The inputs to it are amount from currency to currency.\nit are amount from currency to currency.\nit are amount from currency to currency. So basically when you are asking a\nSo basically when you are asking a\nSo basically when you are asking a question to a large language model let's\nquestion to a large language model let's\nquestion to a large language model let's say for example you are asking\nsay for example you are asking\nsay for example you are asking convert\nconvert\nconvert 100 USD to INR. So LLM is basically\n100 USD to INR. So LLM is basically\n100 USD to INR. So LLM is basically taking this input interpreting\ntaking this input interpreting\ntaking this input interpreting and understanding yes here the user is\nand understanding yes here the user is\nand understanding yes here the user is talking about this amount my from\ntalking about this amount my from\ntalking about this amount my from currency is USD and my two currency is\ncurrency is USD and my two currency is\ncurrency is USD and my two currency is INR and this is what the large language\nINR and this is what the large language\nINR and this is what the large language model is sending while calling this\nmodel is sending while calling this\nmodel is sending while calling this tool. So it's very clear right these are\ntool. So it's very clear right these are\ntool. So it's very clear right these are the three attributes or parameters that\nthe three attributes or parameters that\nthe three attributes or parameters that are being called and then what's\nare being called and then what's\nare being called and then what's happening the very first thing is it is\nhappening the very first thing is it is\nhappening the very first thing is it is converting the the case to upper case so\nconverting the the case to upper case so\nconverting the the case to upper case so for example if I'm sending us\nfor example if I'm sending us\nfor example if I'm sending us it's basically becoming US\nit's basically becoming US\nit's basically becoming US INR become INR right because these are\nINR become INR right because these are\nINR become INR right because these are standards and then you are calling this\nstandards and then you are calling this\nstandards and then you are calling this URL for example let's say I'm going to\nURL for example let's say I'm going to\nURL for example let's say I'm going to show you\nshow you\nshow you let's say from currency. So instead of\nlet's say from currency. So instead of\nlet's say from currency. So instead of this let's say I'm going to do US right.\nthis let's say I'm going to do US right.\nthis let's say I'm going to do US right. So let's\nSo let's\nSo let's tweak it and you can see the result is\ntweak it and you can see the result is\ntweak it and you can see the result is success and you can see there are so\nsuccess and you can see there are so\nsuccess and you can see there are so many things mentioned here right.\nmany things mentioned here right.\nmany things mentioned here right. So eventually if you are invoking this\nSo eventually if you are invoking this\nSo eventually if you are invoking this for 100 USD to INR basically your output\nfor 100 USD to INR basically your output\nfor 100 USD to INR basically your output will be\nwill be\nwill be 90.97\n90.97\n90.97 let's say you are asking 100 USD right\nlet's say you are asking 100 USD right\nlet's say you are asking 100 USD right so your output here will be\n100 multiplied with 90.97 whatever it is\n100 multiplied with 90.97 whatever it is whatever it is this much INR are that is\nwhatever it is this much INR are that is\nwhatever it is this much INR are that is what the tool will respond. I hope\nwhat the tool will respond. I hope\nwhat the tool will respond. I hope everybody is clear right\neverybody is clear right\neverybody is clear right and you can see there is a block to\nand you can see there is a block to\nand you can see there is a block to parse the request if there is a timeout\nparse the request if there is a timeout\nparse the request if there is a timeout there will be a timeout these kind of\nthere will be a timeout these kind of\nthere will be a timeout these kind of checks and and then eventually you are\nchecks and and then eventually you are\nchecks and and then eventually you are able to return this thing. So this will\nable to return this thing. So this will\nable to return this thing. So this will be the final output. For example, your\nbe the final output. For example, your\nbe the final output. For example, your fin final output is going to be\nfin final output is going to be\nfin final output is going to be something like this. So basically it\nsomething like this. So basically it\nsomething like this. So basically it will be amount\nwill be amount\nwill be amount uh let's say 100\nINR something like that and the rate is\nINR something like that and the rate is 90.97\n90.97\n90.97 and that is what the tool is responding\nand that is what the tool is responding\nand that is what the tool is responding that is not your final LLM output okay\nthat is not your final LLM output okay\nthat is not your final LLM output okay remember that LLM is however taking this\nremember that LLM is however taking this\nremember that LLM is however taking this and then LLM will respond back well the\nand then LLM will respond back well the\nand then LLM will respond back well the amount whatever it responds right the\namount whatever it responds right the\namount whatever it responds right the 100 USD to INR is basically uh something\n100 USD to INR is basically uh something\n100 USD to INR is basically uh something this multiplied with this something like\nthis multiplied with this something like\nthis multiplied with this something like that it will respond\nthat it will respond\nthat it will respond I hope it is clear right moving on to\nI hope it is clear right moving on to\nI hope it is clear right moving on to the second one the second tool which is\nthe second one the second tool which is\nthe second one the second tool which is get current weather\nget current weather\nget current weather so the second tool we are talking about\nso the second tool we are talking about\nso the second tool we are talking about is\nGet\nGet current\ncurrent\ncurrent weather.\nweather.\nweather. Get current weather from a city. Now\nGet current weather from a city. Now\nGet current weather from a city. Now here also it is calling this particular\nhere also it is calling this particular\nhere also it is calling this particular API. Um for now my API is not working\nAPI. Um for now my API is not working\nAPI. Um for now my API is not working but I will give it a try whether it is\nbut I will give it a try whether it is\nbut I will give it a try whether it is working now or not. Let's say I'm going\nworking now or not. Let's say I'm going\nworking now or not. Let's say I'm going to pass\nto pass\nto pass Osaka or else maybe I'll pass\nOsaka or else maybe I'll pass\nOsaka or else maybe I'll pass um Mumbai.\num Mumbai.\num Mumbai. Okay. Uh because we are using an\nOkay. Uh because we are using an\nOkay. Uh because we are using an external API so there are chances it\nexternal API so there are chances it\nexternal API so there are chances it might not work because just before\nmight not work because just before\nmight not work because just before recording this video I was also trying\nrecording this video I was also trying\nrecording this video I was also trying it out. It was completely working fine.\nit out. It was completely working fine.\nit out. It was completely working fine. You can see the uh stack trace as well\nYou can see the uh stack trace as well\nYou can see the uh stack trace as well that whatever I was asking it was\nthat whatever I was asking it was\nthat whatever I was asking it was working. Yeah, it started throwing me\nworking. Yeah, it started throwing me\nworking. Yeah, it started throwing me error for the the weather API because\nerror for the the weather API because\nerror for the the weather API because it's a free API, right? But as you can\nit's a free API, right? But as you can\nit's a free API, right? But as you can see, it's working right now and that\nsee, it's working right now and that\nsee, it's working right now and that failure could be because\nfailure could be because\nfailure could be because I was trying out with Osaka and maybe\nI was trying out with Osaka and maybe\nI was trying out with Osaka and maybe for that particular city number of\nfor that particular city number of\nfor that particular city number of requests were already breached. I don't\nrequests were already breached. I don't\nrequests were already breached. I don't know how their API works, right? They\nknow how their API works, right? They\nknow how their API works, right? They might have a check based on the city. I\nmight have a check based on the city. I\nmight have a check based on the city. I don't know. But anyways, how this tool\ndon't know. But anyways, how this tool\ndon't know. But anyways, how this tool gets invoked is when it understands the\ngets invoked is when it understands the\ngets invoked is when it understands the user is asking something about the\nuser is asking something about the\nuser is asking something about the weather conditions for a particular\nweather conditions for a particular\nweather conditions for a particular city. So city goes into the input for\ncity. So city goes into the input for\ncity. So city goes into the input for this method tool and then you are\nthis method tool and then you are\nthis method tool and then you are basically extracting that and passing it\nbasically extracting that and passing it\nbasically extracting that and passing it here. Right?\nhere. Right?\nhere. Right? And then you have some checks for 200\nAnd then you have some checks for 200\nAnd then you have some checks for 200 HTTP code. If not everything is fine and\nHTTP code. If not everything is fine and\nHTTP code. If not everything is fine and then you extract this information. So\nthen you extract this information. So\nthen you extract this information. So you will be getting all these\nyou will be getting all these\nyou will be getting all these information like what is the current\ninformation like what is the current\ninformation like what is the current weather, the current temperature,\nweather, the current temperature,\nweather, the current temperature, humidity, wind, blah blah blah. Okay.\nhumidity, wind, blah blah blah. Okay.\nhumidity, wind, blah blah blah. Okay. So tools are defined. Now after the\nSo tools are defined. Now after the\nSo tools are defined. Now after the tools are defined you can see I am just\ntools are defined you can see I am just\ntools are defined you can see I am just you know creating a list where I am\nyou know creating a list where I am\nyou know creating a list where I am adding both of these tools, right? And\nadding both of these tools, right? And\nadding both of these tools, right? And if you look\nhere is where I'm calling the bind\nhere is where I'm calling the bind tools. Okay. So, llm dot bind tools.\ntools. Okay. So, llm dot bind tools.\ntools. Okay. So, llm dot bind tools. Right\nRight\nRight now, here I have created my agent state.\nnow, here I have created my agent state.\nnow, here I have created my agent state. I hope everybody knows about agent\nI hope everybody knows about agent\nI hope everybody knows about agent state, right? I'm creating that. This is\nstate, right? I'm creating that. This is\nstate, right? I'm creating that. This is where I'm calling the large language\nwhere I'm calling the large language\nwhere I'm calling the large language model.\nmodel.\nmodel. In case you want to switch it to Olama\nIn case you want to switch it to Olama\nIn case you want to switch it to Olama or OpenAI, I think everybody knows how\nor OpenAI, I think everybody knows how\nor OpenAI, I think everybody knows how to do that. Or else you can take help of\nto do that. Or else you can take help of\nto do that. Or else you can take help of chat GPT or Groc right. API key is\nchat GPT or Groc right. API key is\nchat GPT or Groc right. API key is something that\nsomething that\nsomething that is internal. I am not sure my old API\nis internal. I am not sure my old API\nis internal. I am not sure my old API key might not be working. So let me try\nkey might not be working. So let me try\nkey might not be working. So let me try to check a new API key.\nto check a new API key.\nto check a new API key. Uh billing API credits API keys.\nUh billing API credits API keys.\nUh billing API credits API keys. Um\nUm\nUm okay let's create one for example\nokay let's create one for example\nokay let's create one for example agentic p\ndone\ndone that's it\nthat's it\nthat's it and then here is where I'm creating the\nand then here is where I'm creating the\nand then here is where I'm creating the agent node\nwait okay so I have my agent node\nwait okay so I have my agent node and then here I'm invoking\nand then here I'm invoking\nand then here I'm invoking based on the system message interpreting\nbased on the system message interpreting\nbased on the system message interpreting and invoking the tools.\nand invoking the tools.\nand invoking the tools. Right?\nWe have a method called as should\nWe have a method called as should continue or not. Then we have summary\ncontinue or not. Then we have summary\ncontinue or not. Then we have summary conversation. This is not needed. This\nconversation. This is not needed. This\nconversation. This is not needed. This is not used. So I will just try to\nis not used. So I will just try to\nis not used. So I will just try to remove it.\nremove it.\nremove it. And this is the most important part\nAnd this is the most important part\nAnd this is the most important part which is the graph part. Right now let\nwhich is the graph part. Right now let\nwhich is the graph part. Right now let me just try to comment it out. Okay.\nme just try to comment it out. Okay.\nme just try to comment it out. Okay. It's not needed.\nIt's not needed.\nIt's not needed. Now if I talk about this graph right let\nNow if I talk about this graph right let\nNow if I talk about this graph right let me try to take this piece of code\nand then I will explain you here itself.\nand then I will explain you here itself. So talking about the graph\nvery simple interpreting a graph is very\nvery simple interpreting a graph is very simple just try to understand that there\nsimple just try to understand that there\nsimple just try to understand that there are two three things one is node\nare two three things one is node\nare two three things one is node second is edge\nsecond is edge\nsecond is edge third is computational edge.\nthird is computational edge.\nthird is computational edge. Okay. Now whenever you are defining your\nOkay. Now whenever you are defining your\nOkay. Now whenever you are defining your graph the very first step is to define a\ngraph the very first step is to define a\ngraph the very first step is to define a node. So in this case you have first\nnode. So in this case you have first\nnode. So in this case you have first defined your state graph in that you\ndefined your state graph in that you\ndefined your state graph in that you defined a node. So let's say this is my\ndefined a node. So let's say this is my\ndefined a node. So let's say this is my agent node.\nOkay. Then we have the tools node.\nOkay. Then we have the tools node. Tools node.\nOkay. Till now I have created the agent\nOkay. Till now I have created the agent and the tools node.\nand the tools node.\nand the tools node. Then I have this add edge which is start\nThen I have this add edge which is start\nThen I have this add edge which is start with agent. So I will have the start\nwith agent. So I will have the start\nwith agent. So I will have the start here.\nOkay. And then we have add conditional\nOkay. And then we have add conditional ages with agent\nages with agent\nages with agent with the tools should continue or not.\nwith the tools should continue or not.\nwith the tools should continue or not. So it's like yes\nSo it's like yes\nSo it's like yes or no.\nor no.\nor no. If the agent identifies that the user\nIf the agent identifies that the user\nIf the agent identifies that the user questions are not related to the task uh\nquestions are not related to the task uh\nquestions are not related to the task uh to the not related to the task it will\nto the not related to the task it will\nto the not related to the task it will go this side right so I can note it down\ngo this side right so I can note it down\ngo this side right so I can note it down as end\nas end\nas end but if it is invoking the tool then you\nbut if it is invoking the tool then you\nbut if it is invoking the tool then you know which tool to invoke tool number\nknow which tool to invoke tool number\nknow which tool to invoke tool number one\none\none or tool number two and of course it will\nor tool number two and of course it will\nor tool number two and of course it will be something like this and then\nbe something like this and then\nbe something like this and then eventually whatever it is you will\neventually whatever it is you will\neventually whatever it is you will ending the loop. Okay. So that's\nending the loop. Okay. So that's\nending the loop. Okay. So that's basically the graph representation. I\nbasically the graph representation. I\nbasically the graph representation. I can also\ncan also\ncan also take the help of chart GPT to generate\ntake the help of chart GPT to generate\ntake the help of chart GPT to generate this graph.\nthis graph.\nthis graph. Can you generate a graph for this code?\nCan you generate a graph for this code?\nCan you generate a graph for this code? I hope they will be able to generate\nsomething like this. Right? From start\nsomething like this. Right? From start we have agent then we have tools then we\nwe have agent then we have tools then we\nwe have agent then we have tools then we have agent then we have the end\nhave agent then we have the end\nhave agent then we have the end right so mine is also similar in fact\nright so mine is also similar in fact\nright so mine is also similar in fact mine is better\nmine is better\nmine is better okay\nso that's pretty much it and then moving\nso that's pretty much it and then moving ahead\nahead\nahead um here we have defined the memory saver\num here we have defined the memory saver\num here we have defined the memory saver so try to remember that in the context\nso try to remember that in the context\nso try to remember that in the context of agentic AI there are two typ types of\nof agentic AI there are two typ types of\nof agentic AI there are two typ types of memory.\nThere is one short-term memory and there\nThere is one short-term memory and there is one long-term memory. Short-term\nis one long-term memory. Short-term\nis one long-term memory. Short-term memory is basically your current session\nmemory is basically your current session\nmemory is basically your current session and\nand\nand current messages.\nLong-term memory is your end goal\nLong-term memory is your end goal and your past or historical\nOkay, that's basically going to be your\nOkay, that's basically going to be your memory.\nmemory.\nmemory. What else?\nYeah. So your graph is complete here and\nYeah. So your graph is complete here and here you are compiling the workflow and\nhere you are compiling the workflow and\nhere you are compiling the workflow and that's it. Then you have the main\nthat's it. Then you have the main\nthat's it. Then you have the main function\nand then based on that you are taking it\nand then based on that you are taking it from the input whatever questions he\nfrom the input whatever questions he\nfrom the input whatever questions he will be asking the agent you will be\nwill be asking the agent you will be\nwill be asking the agent you will be able to answer. If you pass any of these\nable to answer. If you pass any of these\nable to answer. If you pass any of these keywords the agentic framework will\nkeywords the agentic framework will\nkeywords the agentic framework will stop. Now instead of this you can also\nstop. Now instead of this you can also\nstop. Now instead of this you can also use a large language model to interpret\nuse a large language model to interpret\nuse a large language model to interpret the intent and also break the loop. For\nthe intent and also break the loop. For\nthe intent and also break the loop. For example, let's say instead of these\nexample, let's say instead of these\nexample, let's say instead of these hardcoded values let's say the user is\nhardcoded values let's say the user is\nhardcoded values let's say the user is telling just just for an example right\ntelling just just for an example right\ntelling just just for an example right bug off or f off or come on close this\nbug off or f off or come on close this\nbug off or f off or come on close this window something like that. So in that\nwindow something like that. So in that\nwindow something like that. So in that case also you can invoke the LM and do\ncase also you can invoke the LM and do\ncase also you can invoke the LM and do that. But in in this case we are hard\nthat. But in in this case we are hard\nthat. But in in this case we are hard coding it into four different options.\ncoding it into four different options.\ncoding it into four different options. Okay. And that's pretty much it. Let's\nOkay. And that's pretty much it. Let's\nOkay. And that's pretty much it. Let's try to run this and see whether we're\ntry to run this and see whether we're\ntry to run this and see whether we're able to get the output or not. Well,\nable to get the output or not. Well,\nable to get the output or not. Well, it's already tested so nothing needs to\nit's already tested so nothing needs to\nit's already tested so nothing needs to be uh tested again. Still\nbe uh tested again. Still\nbe uh tested again. Still one more good practice that you can do\none more good practice that you can do\none more good practice that you can do here is as this is a completely AI\nhere is as this is a completely AI\nhere is as this is a completely AI generated code it's everything is in one\ngenerated code it's everything is in one\ngenerated code it's everything is in one file right maybe what you can do is if\nfile right maybe what you can do is if\nfile right maybe what you can do is if you want to make this as your project\nyou want to make this as your project\nyou want to make this as your project then I will recommend you to have a\nthen I will recommend you to have a\nthen I will recommend you to have a proper project structure\nproper project structure\nproper project structure something like let's say you have a\nsomething like let's say you have a\nsomething like let's say you have a folder let's say the project name and\nfolder let's say the project name and\nfolder let's say the project name and then inside the folder\nthen inside the folder\nthen inside the folder You can have data. Well, in this case,\nYou can have data. Well, in this case,\nYou can have data. Well, in this case, we don't have data. Maybe we can have\nwe don't have data. Maybe we can have\nwe don't have data. Maybe we can have like a a pro a folder called as tools, a\nlike a a pro a folder called as tools, a\nlike a a pro a folder called as tools, a folder called as agents, a folder called\nfolder called as agents, a folder called\nfolder called as agents, a folder called as workflow,\nand a main folder something like that,\nand a main folder something like that, which will make it like a structured\nwhich will make it like a structured\nwhich will make it like a structured project. So, it's asking let's let's ask\nproject. So, it's asking let's let's ask\nproject. So, it's asking let's let's ask something. Let's say who is Roger\nsomething. Let's say who is Roger\nsomething. Let's say who is Roger Federer?\nI have asked something which is not\nI have asked something which is not related to the tools. So let's see what\nrelated to the tools. So let's see what\nrelated to the tools. So let's see what the LLM is responding. So LLM has\nthe LLM is responding. So LLM has\nthe LLM is responding. So LLM has responded a generic answer. Right? So\nresponded a generic answer. Right? So\nresponded a generic answer. Right? So basically it is falling into this\nbasically it is falling into this\nbasically it is falling into this category. Right?\ncategory. Right?\ncategory. Right? It asked then it went and then it\nIt asked then it went and then it\nIt asked then it went and then it answered. Right?\nanswered. Right?\nanswered. Right? Let's say now I'm going to ask what is\nLet's say now I'm going to ask what is\nLet's say now I'm going to ask what is the weather\nthe weather\nthe weather spelling is wrong which is fine weather\nspelling is wrong which is fine weather\nspelling is wrong which is fine weather in\nin\nin Kolkata today\nKolkata today\nKolkata today spelling mistakes are there fine\nspelling mistakes are there fine\nspelling mistakes are there fine deliberately I have put Kolkata has\ndeliberately I have put Kolkata has\ndeliberately I have put Kolkata has single T and whether of course E and A\nsingle T and whether of course E and A\nsingle T and whether of course E and A are inter interchanged\nare inter interchanged\nare inter interchanged so yes you are able to get so you can\nso yes you are able to get so you can\nso yes you are able to get so you can see this output that you're getting is\nsee this output that you're getting is\nsee this output that you're getting is basically the print statement of your\nbasically the print statement of your\nbasically the print statement of your that particular tool. So this one you're\nthat particular tool. So this one you're\nthat particular tool. So this one you're basically getting this output\nbasically getting this output\nbasically getting this output right current weather in Kolkata is blah\nright current weather in Kolkata is blah\nright current weather in Kolkata is blah blah blah then 30° Celsius here is\nblah blah then 30° Celsius here is\nblah blah then 30° Celsius here is humidity and that's exactly based on\nhumidity and that's exactly based on\nhumidity and that's exactly based on what you are returning here and then\nwhat you are returning here and then\nwhat you are returning here and then what happens is it took few more seconds\nwhat happens is it took few more seconds\nwhat happens is it took few more seconds and then you are able to get this\nand then you are able to get this\nand then you are able to get this generated output. Now this is by your\ngenerated output. Now this is by your\ngenerated output. Now this is by your large language model.\nlarge language model.\nlarge language model. Okay. If you want to ask a follow-up\nOkay. If you want to ask a follow-up\nOkay. If you want to ask a follow-up question, you can ask or else if you\nquestion, you can ask or else if you\nquestion, you can ask or else if you want to close it, you can close it.\nwant to close it, you can close it.\nwant to close it, you can close it.

You can easily work with Langraph because this\neasily work with Langraph because this\neasily work with Langraph because this video is like purely focused on\nvideo is like purely focused on\nvideo is like purely focused on Langraph. And if you do not know about\nLangraph. And if you do not know about\nLangraph. And if you do not know about Langraph, Langraph is built on top of\nLangraph, Langraph is built on top of\nLangraph, Langraph is built on top of Langchain. Okay. And this gives you more\nLangchain. Okay. And this gives you more\nLangchain. Okay. And this gives you more control. And to be honest, in the\ncontrol. And to be honest, in the\ncontrol. And to be honest, in the industry, in the companies, we use\nindustry, in the companies, we use\nindustry, in the companies, we use Langraph.\nLangraph.\nLangraph. Most of the time we integrate a lang\nMost of the time we integrate a lang\nMost of the time we integrate a lang chain with Langra. But when we want to\nchain with Langra. But when we want to\nchain with Langra. But when we want to build the solutions, we use Langra. And\nbuild the solutions, we use Langra. And\nbuild the solutions, we use Langra. And obviously that is why you are seeing\nobviously that is why you are seeing\nobviously that is why you are seeing lang graph everywhere in the job\nlang graph everywhere in the job\nlang graph everywhere in the job descriptions as well.

That's it. Okay. And\njust teach you. That's it. Okay. And let's get started with our amazing\nlet's get started with our amazing\nlet's get started with our amazing master class on Langraph. And these are\nmaster class on Langraph. And these are\nmaster class on Langraph. And these are some handles of mine. If you just want\nsome handles of mine. If you just want\nsome handles of mine. If you just want to follow me, you can just do that.\nto follow me, you can just do that.\nto follow me, you can just do that. Okay. So, let's try to get started. Not\nOkay. So, let's try to get started. Not\nOkay. So, let's try to get started. Not try. Let's get started with our langraph\ntry. Let's get started with our langraph\ntry. Let's get started with our langraph master class. So finally in the langraph\nmaster class. So finally in the langraph\nmaster class. So finally in the langraph classroom. So now first thing first I\nclassroom. So now first thing first I\nclassroom. So now first thing first I want to ask you one question.\nwant to ask you one question.\nwant to ask you one question. Why do you need to learn langraph?\nWhy do you need to learn langraph?\nWhy do you need to learn langraph? Because if you do not know why then I\nBecause if you do not know why then I\nBecause if you do not know why then I don't know how you will learn it.\ndon't know how you will learn it.\ndon't know how you will learn it. Simple. So let's talk about first of all\nSimple. So let's talk about first of all\nSimple. So let's talk about first of all why langraph. Okay. And then obviously\nwhy langraph. Okay. And then obviously\nwhy langraph. Okay. And then obviously what is langraph will be automatically\nwhat is langraph will be automatically\nwhat is langraph will be automatically covered. Make sense? And as I just said\ncovered. Make sense? And as I just said\ncovered. Make sense? And as I just said earlier, if you already know Langchain,\nearlier, if you already know Langchain,\nearlier, if you already know Langchain, it will be a little bit easy for you to\nit will be a little bit easy for you to\nit will be a little bit easy for you to understand. And even if you do not know\nunderstand. And even if you do not know\nunderstand. And even if you do not know about Langchain, don't worry. I will\nabout Langchain, don't worry. I will\nabout Langchain, don't worry. I will just make it easy for you. So just\njust make it easy for you. So just\njust make it easy for you. So just enjoy. So basically, Langraph,\nenjoy. So basically, Langraph,\nenjoy. So basically, Langraph, Langraph is the most popular framework\nLangraph is the most popular framework\nLangraph is the most popular framework right now in the era of agentic AI. What\nright now in the era of agentic AI. What\nright now in the era of agentic AI. What did I say? Agentic. Okay. So I can say\ndid I say? Agentic. Okay. So I can say\ndid I say? Agentic. Okay. So I can say lang chain is the kind of go-to\nlang chain is the kind of go-to\nlang chain is the kind of go-to framework\nfor agent ad\nfor agent ad aent app solution whatever you want to\naent app solution whatever you want to\naent app solution whatever you want to say\nsay\nsay because it is open source it is free you\nbecause it is open source it is free you\nbecause it is open source it is free you do not need to pay to anyone and it is\ndo not need to pay to anyone and it is\ndo not need to pay to anyone and it is amazing like I personally love it\namazing like I personally love it\namazing like I personally love it I'm a big fan of a like langraph so Now\nI'm a big fan of a like langraph so Now\nI'm a big fan of a like langraph so Now let's talk about it. So basically what\nlet's talk about it. So basically what\nlet's talk about it. So basically what will happen if I want to create agent\nwill happen if I want to create agent\nwill happen if I want to create agent solution? I need to build first of all\nsolution? I need to build first of all\nsolution? I need to build first of all AI agent\nAI agent\nAI agent then I need to build the agenti\nthen I need to build the agenti\nthen I need to build the agenti solution. Now you can be tricked. You'll\nsolution. Now you can be tricked. You'll\nsolution. Now you can be tricked. You'll be like hey what is the difference\nbe like hey what is the difference\nbe like hey what is the difference between AI agent and agenti? That's a\nbetween AI agent and agenti? That's a\nbetween AI agent and agenti? That's a very good question because that should\nvery good question because that should\nvery good question because that should be your first question. So now let's try\nbe your first question. So now let's try\nbe your first question. So now let's try to talk about\nto talk about\nto talk about AI agent\nsimple do you know what the difference\nsimple do you know what the difference is very very simple and very\nis very very simple and very\nis very very simple and very straightforward so let's talk about AI\nstraightforward so let's talk about AI\nstraightforward so let's talk about AI agent first of all and then we can just\nagent first of all and then we can just\nagent first of all and then we can just go to our you can say agenticare simple\ngo to our you can say agenticare simple\ngo to our you can say agenticare simple so if I want to talk about AI agent\nso if I want to talk about AI agent\nso if I want to talk about AI agent first of all so AI agent It is like when\nfirst of all so AI agent It is like when\nfirst of all so AI agent It is like when you want to build a solution which can\nyou want to build a solution which can\nyou want to build a solution which can perform some tasks on its own\nperform some tasks on its own\nperform some tasks on its own simple for example let's say um you want\nsimple for example let's say um you want\nsimple for example let's say um you want to create a chatbot if you have used\nto create a chatbot if you have used\nto create a chatbot if you have used chat GBD let me just open any chat GBD\nchat GBD let me just open any chat GBD\nchat GBD let me just open any chat GBD instance that's a kind of\ninstance that's a kind of\ninstance that's a kind of um kind of AI agent kind of because now\num kind of AI agent kind of because now\num kind of AI agent kind of because now it can perform so many tasks earlier it\nit can perform so many tasks earlier it\nit can perform so many tasks earlier it was not but now it can perform because\nwas not but now it can perform because\nwas not but now it can perform because it can perform some tool calls and it\nit can perform some tool calls and it\nit can perform some tool calls and it can perform some searching as well\ncan perform some searching as well\ncan perform some searching as well whatever it you want to perform. So here\nwhatever it you want to perform. So here\nwhatever it you want to perform. So here if I say um what\nif I say um what\nif I say um what is the temperature\nis the temperature\nis the temperature in let's say Bangalore\nright now so now what it will do it will\nright now so now what it will do it will simply do something magical behind the\nsimply do something magical behind the\nsimply do something magical behind the scenes nothing magical it will simply\nscenes nothing magical it will simply\nscenes nothing magical it will simply say searching the web see so now it is\nsay searching the web see so now it is\nsay searching the web see so now it is saying right now in Bangalore or\nsaying right now in Bangalore or\nsaying right now in Bangalore or Bangaluru India the current temperature\nBangaluru India the current temperature\nBangaluru India the current temperature is 29° wow feels 29. Wow. Under clear\nis 29° wow feels 29. Wow. Under clear\nis 29° wow feels 29. Wow. Under clear skies. So, how did it know this thing?\nskies. So, how did it know this thing?\nskies. So, how did it know this thing? How? Obviously, it is not storing all of\nHow? Obviously, it is not storing all of\nHow? Obviously, it is not storing all of the data\nthe data\nthe data um continuously. So, it made something\num continuously. So, it made something\num continuously. So, it made something called as API call. Make sense? So,\ncalled as API call. Make sense? So,\ncalled as API call. Make sense? So, agent will look like this. Let's say you\nagent will look like this. Let's say you\nagent will look like this. Let's say you are building an AI agent. So, let me\nare building an AI agent. So, let me\nare building an AI agent. So, let me first of all remove this. Let's first of\nfirst of all remove this. Let's first of\nfirst of all remove this. Let's first of all talk about AI agent. So, what it\nall talk about AI agent. So, what it\nall talk about AI agent. So, what it will do? So let's say we have the agent\nwill do? So let's say we have the agent\nwill do? So let's say we have the agent and let's say agent is look like is is\nand let's say agent is look like is is\nand let's say agent is look like is is like a this person make sense okay\nlike a this person make sense okay\nlike a this person make sense okay let's say this is the AI agent okay now\nlet's say this is the AI agent okay now\nlet's say this is the AI agent okay now you came to this person\nyou came to this person\nyou came to this person this is you\nthis is you\nthis is you you came to this person and you said hey\nyou came to this person and you said hey\nyou came to this person and you said hey I want to know the temperature in\nI want to know the temperature in\nI want to know the temperature in Bangalore simple simple your query\nBangalore simple simple your query\nBangalore simple simple your query now this will\nnow this will\nnow this will process information and this has\nprocess information and this has\nprocess information and this has something called as some tools. What\nsomething called as some tools. What\nsomething called as some tools. What kind of tools? Let's say it has some\nkind of tools? Let's say it has some\nkind of tools? Let's say it has some some tools like lots of tools. Let's say\nsome tools like lots of tools. Let's say\nsome tools like lots of tools. Let's say it can be accessing the internet.\nit can be accessing the internet.\nit can be accessing the internet. Obviously, it can access internet like\nObviously, it can access internet like\nObviously, it can access internet like um making the API calls or weather\num making the API calls or weather\num making the API calls or weather information or anything. So, what it\ninformation or anything. So, what it\ninformation or anything. So, what it will do? It will make those API calls\nwill do? It will make those API calls\nwill do? It will make those API calls because this is connected to these\nbecause this is connected to these\nbecause this is connected to these tools. Let's say these are the tools.\ntools. Let's say these are the tools.\ntools. Let's say these are the tools. Simple. These are the tools and it will\nSimple. These are the tools and it will\nSimple. These are the tools and it will some make some API calls and it will get\nsome make some API calls and it will get\nsome make some API calls and it will get back the data and you will get the\nback the data and you will get the\nback the data and you will get the response back.\nresponse back.\nresponse back. Simple. But this is a very basic example\nSimple. But this is a very basic example\nSimple. But this is a very basic example of AI agent. Under the hood, AI agent is\nof AI agent. Under the hood, AI agent is\nof AI agent. Under the hood, AI agent is not just like making the API calls. It\nnot just like making the API calls. It\nnot just like making the API calls. It is also about the building the sequence\nis also about the building the sequence\nis also about the building the sequence or basically building the chain,\nor basically building the chain,\nor basically building the chain, building the workflow. So now let's talk\nbuilding the workflow. So now let's talk\nbuilding the workflow. So now let's talk about a little bit complex example.\nabout a little bit complex example.\nabout a little bit complex example. Okay. when you want to create an AI\nOkay. when you want to create an AI\nOkay. when you want to create an AI agent to do your multiple tasks. So for\nagent to do your multiple tasks. So for\nagent to do your multiple tasks. So for example, you have a task number one like\nexample, you have a task number one like\nexample, you have a task number one like this. Okay, you have a task number two\nthis. Okay, you have a task number two\nthis. Okay, you have a task number two like this which will be performed as\nlike this which will be performed as\nlike this which will be performed as after this one.\nafter this one.\nafter this one. Then you have some kind of you can say\nThen you have some kind of you can say\nThen you have some kind of you can say parallel tasks like this\nparallel tasks like this\nparallel tasks like this like this like this. So you can perform\nlike this like this. So you can perform\nlike this like this. So you can perform all of these tasks simple\nall of these tasks simple\nall of these tasks simple because AI is just a like hyped word\nbecause AI is just a like hyped word\nbecause AI is just a like hyped word under the hood is just like workflow\nunder the hood is just like workflow\nunder the hood is just like workflow simple. Okay, simpler\nsimple. Okay, simpler\nsimple. Okay, simpler the way you will look at um at AI stuff\nthe way you will look at um at AI stuff\nthe way you will look at um at AI stuff or AI engineering better you can\nor AI engineering better you can\nor AI engineering better you can understand it. If you'll be keep on\nunderstand it. If you'll be keep on\nunderstand it. If you'll be keep on learning the technology by using words\nlearning the technology by using words\nlearning the technology by using words AI agent, agentic AI, you'll be like bro\nAI agent, agentic AI, you'll be like bro\nAI agent, agentic AI, you'll be like bro what is this? If you know like this is a\nwhat is this? If you know like this is a\nwhat is this? If you know like this is a workflow it's fine because you can build\nworkflow it's fine because you can build\nworkflow it's fine because you can build these kind of workflows using pure\nthese kind of workflows using pure\nthese kind of workflows using pure Python as well. But why do we use these\nPython as well. But why do we use these\nPython as well. But why do we use these framework? because they have like strong\nframework? because they have like strong\nframework? because they have like strong integration with those APIs and those\nintegration with those APIs and those\nintegration with those APIs and those service providers. That's the only\nservice providers. That's the only\nservice providers. That's the only reason we use these frameworks. You can\nreason we use these frameworks. You can\nreason we use these frameworks. You can build these frameworks with Python as\nbuild these frameworks with Python as\nbuild these frameworks with Python as well. Not a big deal. So these are some\nwell. Not a big deal. So these are some\nwell. Not a big deal. So these are some tasks and let's say all once all of\ntasks and let's say all once all of\ntasks and let's say all once all of these tasks are completed, you need to\nthese tasks are completed, you need to\nthese tasks are completed, you need to do this task. Fine. So this is a kind of\ndo this task. Fine. So this is a kind of\ndo this task. Fine. So this is a kind of AI agent that you have built a kind of\nAI agent that you have built a kind of\nAI agent that you have built a kind of workflow.\nworkflow.\nworkflow. Simple. This is the AI agent that you\nSimple. This is the AI agent that you\nSimple. This is the AI agent that you have built in lang chain or lang graph\nhave built in lang chain or lang graph\nhave built in lang chain or lang graph kind of frameworks. We call it as a\nkind of frameworks. We call it as a\nkind of frameworks. We call it as a chain\nchain\nchain because what is a chain? Chain is\nbecause what is a chain? Chain is\nbecause what is a chain? Chain is nothing but your AI agent which can\nnothing but your AI agent which can\nnothing but your AI agent which can perform some API calls which can perform\nperform some API calls which can perform\nperform some API calls which can perform some tasks. It can be any agent or it's\nsome tasks. It can be any agent or it's\nsome tasks. It can be any agent or it's not only about the agent. It can be\nnot only about the agent. It can be\nnot only about the agent. It can be agent. It cannot be an agent because\nagent. It cannot be an agent because\nagent. It cannot be an agent because agent also has so many kinds of\nagent also has so many kinds of\nagent also has so many kinds of frameworks. You have a react agent.\nframeworks. You have a react agent.\nframeworks. You have a react agent. Don't worry we'll just talking about all\nDon't worry we'll just talking about all\nDon't worry we'll just talking about all of these things. Currently we are simply\nof these things. Currently we are simply\nof these things. Currently we are simply talking about a very from a very high\ntalking about a very from a very high\ntalking about a very from a very high level overview. Okay. So this is a kind\nlevel overview. Okay. So this is a kind\nlevel overview. Okay. So this is a kind of chain that you create and this can be\nof chain that you create and this can be\nof chain that you create and this can be um considered or you can say bucketed\num considered or you can say bucketed\num considered or you can say bucketed under this category called AI agent.\nunder this category called AI agent.\nunder this category called AI agent. Simple. Okay. Very good. Because it's\nSimple. Okay. Very good. Because it's\nSimple. Okay. Very good. Because it's your own definition. In your case a\nyour own definition. In your case a\nyour own definition. In your case a simple chain can be an AI agent. In my\nsimple chain can be an AI agent. In my\nsimple chain can be an AI agent. In my case let's say I'm building multiple\ncase let's say I'm building multiple\ncase let's say I'm building multiple loops in parallel and so many other\nloops in parallel and so many other\nloops in parallel and so many other things. for for me it's it's my AI\nthings. for for me it's it's my AI\nthings. for for me it's it's my AI agent. So you define your own definition\nagent. So you define your own definition\nagent. So you define your own definition of AI agent because AI means you are\nof AI agent because AI means you are\nof AI agent because AI means you are using some kind of technology under the\nusing some kind of technology under the\nusing some kind of technology under the hood which is LLM.\nhood which is LLM.\nhood which is LLM. Make sense? You are using LLM large\nMake sense? You are using LLM large\nMake sense? You are using LLM large language model and you are utilizing\nlanguage model and you are utilizing\nlanguage model and you are utilizing large language model and you are\nlarge language model and you are\nlarge language model and you are building a chain on top of it so that it\nbuilding a chain on top of it so that it\nbuilding a chain on top of it so that it can perform those tasks because LLMs are\ncan perform those tasks because LLMs are\ncan perform those tasks because LLMs are smart.\nsmart.\nsmart. Simple LLMs are smart. LLMs know like um\nSimple LLMs are smart. LLMs know like um\nSimple LLMs are smart. LLMs know like um how to generate the text and how to make\nhow to generate the text and how to make\nhow to generate the text and how to make those API calls and whatever because\nthose API calls and whatever because\nthose API calls and whatever because with the course of time we have like\nwith the course of time we have like\nwith the course of time we have like amazing open source LLMs as well and\namazing open source LLMs as well and\namazing open source LLMs as well and closed source LLMs as well. Simple make\nclosed source LLMs as well. Simple make\nclosed source LLMs as well. Simple make sense. So now everything was fine. We\nsense. So now everything was fine. We\nsense. So now everything was fine. We were able to work with chains and simple\nwere able to work with chains and simple\nwere able to work with chains and simple workflows. But now with the course of\nworkflows. But now with the course of\nworkflows. But now with the course of time with the more advancements in the\ntime with the more advancements in the\ntime with the more advancements in the you can say AI solutions we found so so\nyou can say AI solutions we found so so\nyou can say AI solutions we found so so so many problems with only this kind of\nso many problems with only this kind of\nso many problems with only this kind of framework we cannot scale it up if we\nframework we cannot scale it up if we\nframework we cannot scale it up if we will scale it up it will actually create\nwill scale it up it will actually create\nwill scale it up it will actually create a mess because you cannot scale it to\na mess because you cannot scale it to\na mess because you cannot scale it to let's say hundreds of nodes or thousands\nlet's say hundreds of nodes or thousands\nlet's say hundreds of nodes or thousands of nodes and in the real world yes we\nof nodes and in the real world yes we\nof nodes and in the real world yes we need to have those kinds of solutions.\nneed to have those kinds of solutions.\nneed to have those kinds of solutions. Let's say you are building the um AI\nLet's say you are building the um AI\nLet's say you are building the um AI solution for the entire enterprise or\nsolution for the entire enterprise or\nsolution for the entire enterprise or let's say for the entire domain for the\nlet's say for the entire domain for the\nlet's say for the entire domain for the entire data domain for the entire\nentire data domain for the entire\nentire data domain for the entire project. Let's say you are building an\nproject. Let's say you are building an\nproject. Let's say you are building an AI solution for your project. You want\nAI solution for your project. You want\nAI solution for your project. You want one agent for data analytics. You want\none agent for data analytics. You want\none agent for data analytics. You want one agent for business analytics. You\none agent for business analytics. You\none agent for business analytics. You want one agent for uh let's say data\nwant one agent for uh let's say data\nwant one agent for uh let's say data engineering. You want one agent for XYZ\nengineering. You want one agent for XYZ\nengineering. You want one agent for XYZ task. So when you will be building such\ntask. So when you will be building such\ntask. So when you will be building such a kind of agent which will perform\na kind of agent which will perform\na kind of agent which will perform everything it will become a mess\neverything it will become a mess\neverything it will become a mess that's where a new concept came into the\nthat's where a new concept came into the\nthat's where a new concept came into the picture which is called agentic AI\npicture which is called agentic AI\npicture which is called agentic AI okay agentic AI okay so agentic AI\nokay agentic AI okay so agentic AI\nokay agentic AI okay so agentic AI means now you created this chain right\nmeans now you created this chain right\nmeans now you created this chain right wow very good very good development let\nwow very good very good development let\nwow very good very good development let me take this chain okay let me put it\nme take this chain okay let me put it\nme take this chain okay let me put it here and let me say okay this is my one\nhere and let me say okay this is my one\nhere and let me say okay this is my one of the chains that I'm using perfect let\nof the chains that I'm using perfect let\nof the chains that I'm using perfect let me just cover it with this one\nme just cover it with this one\nme just cover it with this one simple this is my one chain now I want\nsimple this is my one chain now I want\nsimple this is my one chain now I want to use this chain okay and then I want\nto use this chain okay and then I want\nto use this chain okay and then I want to make another chain\nto make another chain\nto make another chain which will be linked to this one wow can\nwhich will be linked to this one wow can\nwhich will be linked to this one wow can we do it yes that's why we call as\nwe do it yes that's why we call as\nwe do it yes that's why we call as agenti\nagenti\nagenti so then this will take is\nmake sense then this will take place\nmake sense then this will take place let's say these are these chains then\nlet's say these are these chains then\nlet's say these are these chains then after running this thing I want to\nafter running this thing I want to\nafter running this thing I want to run this chain\nrun this chain\nrun this chain okay\nokay\nokay simple let's say I want to run this\nsimple let's say I want to run this\nsimple let's say I want to run this chain\nchain\nchain then after running everything I want to\nthen after running everything I want to\nthen after running everything I want to let's say run one more chain let's say\nlet's say run one more chain let's say\nlet's say run one more chain let's say this let let's keep it like this okay\nthis let let's keep it like this okay\nthis let let's keep it like this okay let's let's say three these three chains\nlet's let's say three these three chains\nlet's let's say three these three chains one for business analytics second for\none for business analytics second for\none for business analytics second for data analytics and then third for data\ndata analytics and then third for data\ndata analytics and then third for data engineering or so on simple now I want\nengineering or so on simple now I want\nengineering or so on simple now I want to like work like this simple I want to\nto like work like this simple I want to\nto like work like this simple I want to work like this now why am I just calling\nwork like this now why am I just calling\nwork like this now why am I just calling it as agenti because now I am building a\nit as agenti because now I am building a\nit as agenti because now I am building a bigger solution I am building multiple\nbigger solution I am building multiple\nbigger solution I am building multiple agents or I can say I can orchestrating\nagents or I can say I can orchestrating\nagents or I can say I can orchestrating multiple agents and not just orchest\nmultiple agents and not just orchest\nmultiple agents and not just orchest orchestrating this is called stateful\norchestrating this is called stateful\norchestrating this is called stateful orchestration because I want this state\norchestration because I want this state\norchestration because I want this state means basically what exactly you are\nmeans basically what exactly you are\nmeans basically what exactly you are traveling between the chain. So I want\ntraveling between the chain. So I want\ntraveling between the chain. So I want this data to travel here and then this\nthis data to travel here and then this\nthis data to travel here and then this data to be traveled here. Wow.\ndata to be traveled here. Wow.\ndata to be traveled here. Wow. This is the concept of agent. This kind\nThis is the concept of agent. This kind\nThis is the concept of agent. This kind of framework is very difficult with this\nof framework is very difficult with this\nof framework is very difficult with this framework alone which is AI agent and\nframework alone which is AI agent and\nframework alone which is AI agent and this is for lang chain. But when we can\nthis is for lang chain. But when we can\nthis is for lang chain. But when we can just build this kind of stuff, it\njust build this kind of stuff, it\njust build this kind of stuff, it becomes agent and we can do it with\nbecomes agent and we can do it with\nbecomes agent and we can do it with langraph\nlangraph\nlangraph because in langraph you have total\nbecause in langraph you have total\nbecause in langraph you have total control over everything. Total control.\ncontrol over everything. Total control.\ncontrol over everything. Total control. You are the owner of your solution. So\nYou are the owner of your solution. So\nYou are the owner of your solution. So who is the owner of solution in langin?\nwho is the owner of solution in langin?\nwho is the owner of solution in langin? You are still the owner but you do not\nYou are still the owner but you do not\nYou are still the owner but you do not have the full control. Okay, I will just\nhave the full control. Okay, I will just\nhave the full control. Okay, I will just talk about it. Don't worry. Talk talk\ntalk about it. Don't worry. Talk talk\ntalk about it. Don't worry. Talk talk talk. I will talk about it. So now this\ntalk. I will talk about it. So now this\ntalk. I will talk about it. So now this is it. This is a very very quick brief\nis it. This is a very very quick brief\nis it. This is a very very quick brief about AI agent and agent AI and this\nabout AI agent and agent AI and this\nabout AI agent and agent AI and this concept should be crystal clear then\nconcept should be crystal clear then\nconcept should be crystal clear then only you can just proceed. Okay very\nonly you can just proceed. Okay very\nonly you can just proceed. Okay very good. So now let's talk about what is\ngood. So now let's talk about what is\ngood. So now let's talk about what is lang graph. Now you can easily\nlang graph. Now you can easily\nlang graph. Now you can easily understand it because you have already\nunderstand it because you have already\nunderstand it because you have already understood the intent behind building\nunderstood the intent behind building\nunderstood the intent behind building langraph.\nlangraph.\nlangraph. Okay. What is lang graph?\nOkay. What is lang graph?\nOkay. What is lang graph? And you know what this is self\nAnd you know what this is self\nAnd you know what this is self self-explanatory\nself-explanatory\nself-explanatory graph. Graph is the main word in\ngraph. Graph is the main word in\ngraph. Graph is the main word in langraph. And just a quick info, lang\nlangraph. And just a quick info, lang\nlangraph. And just a quick info, lang chain was the first framework by the\nchain was the first framework by the\nchain was the first framework by the team who developed langraph and the\nteam who developed langraph and the\nteam who developed langraph and the langraph was the second framework.\nlangraph was the second framework.\nlangraph was the second framework. Langraph was not the first one because\nLangraph was not the first one because\nLangraph was not the first one because when they built lang chain, they built\nwhen they built lang chain, they built\nwhen they built lang chain, they built it. It was a great hit. Okay. But\nit. It was a great hit. Okay. But\nit. It was a great hit. Okay. But companies started complaining or you\ncompanies started complaining or you\ncompanies started complaining or you guys the developers started complaining\nguys the developers started complaining\nguys the developers started complaining that hey we do not have full control\nthat hey we do not have full control\nthat hey we do not have full control over the applications framework solution\nover the applications framework solution\nover the applications framework solution that you're building. Can you please\nthat you're building. Can you please\nthat you're building. Can you please allow us full control? So they came up\nallow us full control? So they came up\nallow us full control? So they came up with the new framework or new library\nwith the new framework or new library\nwith the new framework or new library called Langraph. So they said hey if you\ncalled Langraph. So they said hey if you\ncalled Langraph. So they said hey if you want to use our own you can say built-in\nwant to use our own you can say built-in\nwant to use our own you can say built-in features to build your solution use\nfeatures to build your solution use\nfeatures to build your solution use lang. If you want full control build\nlang. If you want full control build\nlang. If you want full control build langraph but eventually people started\nlangraph but eventually people started\nlangraph but eventually people started using both lang and langraph both. lang\nusing both lang and langraph both. lang\nusing both lang and langraph both. lang chain for like very basic chains so that\nchain for like very basic chains so that\nchain for like very basic chains so that you do not need to write every code from\nyou do not need to write every code from\nyou do not need to write every code from scratch and then after building those\nscratch and then after building those\nscratch and then after building those very very small small chains you started\nvery very small small chains you started\nvery very small small chains you started using um building uh your solutions with\nusing um building uh your solutions with\nusing um building uh your solutions with langraph\nlangraph\nlangraph I know I know for now it is like too\nI know I know for now it is like too\nI know I know for now it is like too much but don't worry at all that's how\nmuch but don't worry at all that's how\nmuch but don't worry at all that's how you grow and learn you need to gather\nyou grow and learn you need to gather\nyou grow and learn you need to gather all of this information and you will\nall of this information and you will\nall of this information and you will actually learn when you'll be just\nactually learn when you'll be just\nactually learn when you'll be just building it and you'll build amazing\nbuilding it and you'll build amazing\nbuilding it and you'll build amazing solutions don't worry with this video so\nsolutions don't worry with this video so\nsolutions don't worry with this video so what is langraph\nLang graph is built on top of lang\nLang graph is built on top of lang chain.\nchain.\nchain. Simple lang chain and is fully\nSimple lang chain and is fully\nSimple lang chain and is fully interoperable. That means you can like\ninteroperable. That means you can like\ninteroperable. That means you can like you do not need to switch the code\nyou do not need to switch the code\nyou do not need to switch the code between langraph. You do not need to do\nbetween langraph. You do not need to do\nbetween langraph. You do not need to do something else. No, langchain and\nsomething else. No, langchain and\nsomething else. No, langchain and langraph both go hand in hand. Both are\nlangraph both go hand in hand. Both are\nlangraph both go hand in hand. Both are best friends. Okay. or I would say\nbest friends. Okay. or I would say\nbest friends. Okay. or I would say brothers okay or sisters because\nbrothers okay or sisters because\nbrothers okay or sisters because see so both are like actually\nsee so both are like actually\nsee so both are like actually integrated okay it's not like if you\nintegrated okay it's not like if you\nintegrated okay it's not like if you know lang chain oh should I just learn\nknow lang chain oh should I just learn\nknow lang chain oh should I just learn lang graph okay um I am learning lang\nlang graph okay um I am learning lang\nlang graph okay um I am learning lang graph should I learn lang chain bro both\ngraph should I learn lang chain bro both\ngraph should I learn lang chain bro both are not separated both both are not\nare not separated both both are not\nare not separated both both are not separated langraph is just a kind of\nseparated langraph is just a kind of\nseparated langraph is just a kind of kind of upgrade of lang chain or you can\nkind of upgrade of lang chain or you can\nkind of upgrade of lang chain or you can say kind of adding more features on top\nsay kind of adding more features on top\nsay kind of adding more features on top of langain Make sense? So instead of\nof langain Make sense? So instead of\nof langain Make sense? So instead of adding more features within lang, they\nadding more features within lang, they\nadding more features within lang, they just create a new library and when we'll\njust create a new library and when we'll\njust create a new library and when we'll be just building the langraph\nbe just building the langraph\nbe just building the langraph applications solutions using VS code and\napplications solutions using VS code and\napplications solutions using VS code and all you will see that most of the\nall you will see that most of the\nall you will see that most of the libraries that we are importing either\nlibraries that we are importing either\nlibraries that we are importing either it's let's say building the LLM\nit's let's say building the LLM\nit's let's say building the LLM connection writing prompts building\nconnection writing prompts building\nconnection writing prompts building chains we will be using lang chain even\nchains we will be using lang chain even\nchains we will be using lang chain even for rags langraph is just for the\nfor rags langraph is just for the\nfor rags langraph is just for the orchestration and building nodes. Wow\norchestration and building nodes. Wow\norchestration and building nodes. Wow lamba you have used two very very heavy\nlamba you have used two very very heavy\nlamba you have used two very very heavy words orchestration and nodes and we do\nwords orchestration and nodes and we do\nwords orchestration and nodes and we do not even know know anything don't worry\nnot even know know anything don't worry\nnot even know know anything don't worry that's why I used it and is fully inter\nthat's why I used it and is fully inter\nthat's why I used it and is fully inter interoperable with\ninteroperable with\ninteroperable with lang chain okay so I use two words okay\nlang chain okay so I use two words okay\nlang chain okay so I use two words okay um orchestration nodes let's talk about\num orchestration nodes let's talk about\num orchestration nodes let's talk about it basically\nit basically\nit basically the\nthe\nthe you can say pillars\nyou can say pillars\nyou can say pillars this is by the way my explanation my\nthis is by the way my explanation my\nthis is by the way my explanation my understanding Okay. So the pillars of\nunderstanding Okay. So the pillars of\nunderstanding Okay. So the pillars of langraph\nlangraph\nlangraph are or you can say the two major\nare or you can say the two major\nare or you can say the two major pillars.\npillars.\npillars. The two major pillars of langraph are\nThe two major pillars of langraph are\nThe two major pillars of langraph are the first one is nodes\nthe first one is nodes\nthe first one is nodes and edges\nand edges\nand edges and then second is orchestration\nand then second is orchestration\nand then second is orchestration or I would say stateful orchestration.\nor I would say stateful orchestration.\nor I would say stateful orchestration. These are the two major pillars that I\nThese are the two major pillars that I\nThese are the two major pillars that I personally feel because I have worked\npersonally feel because I have worked\npersonally feel because I have worked with Langraph. So this is like my\nwith Langraph. So this is like my\nwith Langraph. So this is like my observation. These are the two major\nobservation. These are the two major\nobservation. These are the two major pillars. Simple\npillars. Simple\npillars. Simple two major let's say pillars. Simple\ntwo major let's say pillars. Simple\ntwo major let's say pillars. Simple nodes and edges and stateful\nnodes and edges and stateful\nnodes and edges and stateful orchestration. That means you can build\norchestration. That means you can build\norchestration. That means you can build your solution and you can create\nyour solution and you can create\nyour solution and you can create independent nodes. Nodes. Let me show\nindependent nodes. Nodes. Let me show\nindependent nodes. Nodes. Let me show you. When you see these things, these\nyou. When you see these things, these\nyou. When you see these things, these are nodes. You can say node number one\nare nodes. You can say node number one\nare nodes. You can say node number one simple\nsimple\nsimple then node number two\nthen\nthen let's say node number two and node\nlet's say node number two and node\nlet's say node number two and node number three perfect okay these are the\nnumber three perfect okay these are the\nnumber three perfect okay these are the nodes node one node two node three this\nnodes node one node two node three this\nnodes node one node two node three this is edge\nis edge\nis edge edge or you can say branch same thing\nedge or you can say branch same thing\nedge or you can say branch same thing okay edge one edge\nokay edge one edge\nokay edge one edge So this decides the flow. What is the\nSo this decides the flow. What is the\nSo this decides the flow. What is the dependency? Node dep node defines the\ndependency? Node dep node defines the\ndependency? Node dep node defines the execution what you need to execute.\nexecution what you need to execute.\nexecution what you need to execute. Make sense? And you travel the data.\nMake sense? And you travel the data.\nMake sense? And you travel the data. Whatever the you can say result of this\nWhatever the you can say result of this\nWhatever the you can say result of this particular node will travel to the node\nparticular node will travel to the node\nparticular node will travel to the node two. The result of node two will travel\ntwo. The result of node two will travel\ntwo. The result of node two will travel to the node three.\nMake sense?\nMake sense? Make sense? Okay. Good. So that's how\nMake sense? Okay. Good. So that's how\nMake sense? Okay. Good. So that's how you just travel your data. How you can\nyou just travel your data. How you can\nyou just travel your data. How you can just travel your data? We will talk\njust travel your data? We will talk\njust travel your data? We will talk about it. Don't worry at all. So this is\nabout it. Don't worry at all. So this is\nabout it. Don't worry at all. So this is all about the langraph and stateful\nall about the langraph and stateful\nall about the langraph and stateful orchestration because data travels from\norchestration because data travels from\norchestration because data travels from one node to another node. Simple\none node to another node. Simple\none node to another node. Simple very very very well done. This is the\nvery very very well done. This is the\nvery very very well done. This is the backbone of it. Nodes and edges. And why\nbackbone of it. Nodes and edges. And why\nbackbone of it. Nodes and edges. And why why this is like such a big deal?\nwhy this is like such a big deal?\nwhy this is like such a big deal? Because when you create nodes and when\nBecause when you create nodes and when\nBecause when you create nodes and when you create your own edges, you have full\nyou create your own edges, you have full\nyou create your own edges, you have full control. You can define the condition\ncontrol. You can define the condition\ncontrol. You can define the condition like how it should just flow to the next\nlike how it should just flow to the next\nlike how it should just flow to the next node, how it should just go to the next\nnode, how it should just go to the next\nnode, how it should just go to the next node in lang chain. It's not very much\nnode in lang chain. It's not very much\nnode in lang chain. It's not very much easy. Plus, it does not manage all of\neasy. Plus, it does not manage all of\neasy. Plus, it does not manage all of the things that you will be managing in\nthe things that you will be managing in\nthe things that you will be managing in agent.\nagent.\nagent. Makes sense. Does it make sense? Very\nMakes sense. Does it make sense? Very\nMakes sense. Does it make sense? Very good. So, now you know the problems. Now\ngood. So, now you know the problems. Now\ngood. So, now you know the problems. Now you know the solutions. Now you know why\nyou know the solutions. Now you know why\nyou know the solutions. Now you know why Lang graph. And now you obviously know\nLang graph. And now you obviously know\nLang graph. And now you obviously know what is langraph. It is just a framework\nwhat is langraph.

Very good. Now I\ncontrol with control. Very good. Now I\ncontrol with control. Very good. Now I have also explained a very important\nhave also explained a very important\nhave also explained a very important concept called\nconcept called\nconcept called lang chain and lang graph are not\nlang chain and lang graph are not\nlang chain and lang graph are not separate. They are well integrated. It's\nseparate. They are well integrated. It's\nseparate. They are well integrated. It's a kind of adding more features on top of\na kind of adding more features on top of\na kind of adding more features on top of lang. Simple. So let me try.\nlang. Simple. So let me try.\nlang. Simple. So let me try. It's like adding\nIt's like adding\nIt's like adding more features\nmore features\nmore features on top of language.\non top of language.\non top of language. Simple.\nSimple.\nSimple. Good. Very good. Now let's talk about a\nGood. Very good. Now let's talk about a\nGood. Very good. Now let's talk about a very important one of the most\nvery important one of the most\nvery important one of the most important concept. one of the most\nimportant concept. one of the most\nimportant concept. one of the most important. It is called\nReact agents.\nReact agents. Wow, this is very important. Now let's\nWow, this is very important. Now let's\nWow, this is very important. Now let's talk about the React agents. If you\ntalk about the React agents. If you\ntalk about the React agents. If you already know about this concept called\nalready know about this concept called\nalready know about this concept called React agent, very good. If you do not\nReact agent, very good.

Let me just draw the entire infrastructure infrastructure not\nentire infrastructure infrastructure not\nentire infrastructure infrastructure not infrastructure architecture okay of the\ninfrastructure architecture okay of the\ninfrastructure architecture okay of the react. So let's say you have this agent\nreact. So let's say you have this agent\nreact. So let's say you have this agent okay do I have the better um yeah let's\nokay do I have the better um yeah let's\nokay do I have the better um yeah let's use this one. So let's say this is the\nuse this one. So let's say this is the\nuse this one. So let's say this is the agent.\nagent.\nagent. Simple and agent is nothing but you can\nSimple and agent is nothing but you can\nSimple and agent is nothing but you can say just a kind of node a kind of node.\nsay just a kind of node a kind of node.\nsay just a kind of node a kind of node. one of these nodes. Okay, just node for\none of these nodes. Okay, just node for\none of these nodes. Okay, just node for now. You do not need to go much more\nnow. You do not need to go much more\nnow. You do not need to go much more technical for now. So let's say this is\ntechnical for now. So let's say this is\ntechnical for now. So let's say this is the agent. Now you are this developer.\nthe agent. Now you are this developer.\nthe agent. Now you are this developer. Okay, let's say this one.\nOkay, let's say this one.\nOkay, let's say this one. So you are this developer.\nSo you are this developer.\nSo you are this developer. Okay, and you have asked one question\nOkay, and you have asked one question\nOkay, and you have asked one question from this particular agent.\nfrom this particular agent.\nfrom this particular agent. Simple. This is your input query.\nSimple. This is your input query.\nSimple. This is your input query. Okay, simple.\nOkay, simple.\nOkay, simple. So you have said let's say\nSo you have said let's say\nSo you have said let's say input input query whatever simple. So\ninput input query whatever simple. So\ninput input query whatever simple. So this is the very first step. Now what\nthis is the very first step. Now what\nthis is the very first step. Now what this react agent will do. So now this is\nthis react agent will do. So now this is\nthis react agent will do. So now this is an agent.\nan agent.\nan agent.

Now in langraph\nI have full control. Now in langraph\nI have full control. Now in langraph this is the thing. So in lang chain we\nthis is the thing. So in lang chain we\nthis is the thing. So in lang chain we do not have control over this. But in\ndo not have control over this. But in\ndo not have control over this. But in lang graph we have control. We have full\nlang graph we have control. We have full\nlang graph we have control. We have full control. Why? Because this is a kind of\ncontrol. Why? Because this is a kind of\ncontrol. Why?

That's what I feel because when I\nhood. That's what I feel because when I\nhood.

So that's why I used it because I\nlang. So that's why I used it because I\nlang. So that's why I used it because I use simply langraph to build my agents.\nuse simply langraph to build my agents.\nuse simply langraph to build my agents. I love langraph but yeah when I was just\nI love langraph but yeah when I was just\nI love langraph but yeah when I was just using lang chain for the video I saw\nusing lang chain for the video I saw\nusing lang chain for the video I saw that it is just actually using the same\nthat it is just actually using the same\nthat it is just actually using the same framework under the hood make sense but\nframework under the hood make sense but\nframework under the hood make sense but don't worry we are simply using the\ndon't worry we are simply using the\ndon't worry we are simply using the langraph in this video pure lang graph\nlangraph in this video pure lang graph\nlangraph in this video pure lang graph so this is your react agent now in\nso this is your react agent now in\nso this is your react agent now in langraph it's not just like only\nlangraph it's not just like only\nlangraph it's not just like only building this framework in langraph I\nbuilding this framework in langraph I\nbuilding this framework in langraph I even have human in the loop so I can add\neven have human in the loop so I can add\neven have human in the loop so I can add myself within this loop let's say like\nmyself within this loop let's say like\nmyself within this loop let's say like this wow Oh,\nthis wow Oh,\nthis wow Oh, this is amazing.

So even if you let's say deny that you want\neven if you let's say deny that you want\neven if you let's say deny that you want to make tool calls, let's say tool calls\nto make tool calls, let's say tool calls\nto make tool calls, let's say tool calls are expensive, you want to deny it, you\nare expensive, you want to deny it, you\nare expensive, you want to deny it, you can deny it. It will simply break here.\ncan deny it. It will simply break here.\ncan deny it. It will simply break here. Simple. Break means like it will end the\nSimple. Break means like it will end the\nSimple. Break means like it will end the loop. It will not break it. So that's\nloop. It will not break it. So that's\nloop. It will not break it.

So in\nSo in\nSo in if you if you want to just work with\nif you if you want to just work with\nif you if you want to just work with langraph\nlangraph\nlangraph you need some tools you need some um\nyou need some tools you need some um\nyou need some tools you need some um softwares you need some idees because\nsoftwares you need some idees because\nsoftwares you need some idees because obviously I will not be writing my code\nobviously I will not be writing my code\nobviously I will not be writing my code in notepad okay I'm not that kind of a\nin notepad okay I'm not that kind of a\nin notepad okay I'm not that kind of a guy\nguy\nguy I am a genz so I started working with\nI am a genz so I started working with\nI am a genz so I started working with code and all directly in ids if you know\ncode and all directly in ids if you know\ncode and all directly in ids if you know how to write the code in notepad\nhow to write the code in notepad\nhow to write the code in notepad directly very good keep it up so I will\ndirectly very good keep it up so I will\ndirectly very good keep it up so I will be just using any IDE let's say VS code\nbe just using any IDE let's say VS code\nbe just using any IDE let's say VS code so you need VS code if you want to use\nso you need VS code if you want to use\nso you need VS code if you want to use any other ID let's say PyCharm you can\nany other ID let's say PyCharm you can\nany other ID let's say PyCharm you can use PyCharm if you want to use cursor\nuse PyCharm if you want to use cursor\nuse PyCharm if you want to use cursor you want you can use cursor if you want\nyou want you can use cursor if you want\nyou want you can use cursor if you want to use anti-gravity which is a new one\nto use anti-gravity which is a new one\nto use anti-gravity which is a new one and is actually good because you get the\nand is actually good because you get the\nand is actually good because you get the agentic capabilities you get agentic\nagentic capabilities you get agentic\nagentic capabilities you get agentic capabilities with VS code as well but it\ncapabilities with VS code as well but it\ncapabilities with VS code as well but it is for like just for few tokens per day\nis for like just for few tokens per day\nis for like just for few tokens per day but if you just upgrade it you can just\nbut if you just upgrade it you can just\nbut if you just upgrade it you can just if it's like um you can use any\nif it's like um you can use any\nif it's like um you can use any coderator I don't need to promote\ncoderator I don't need to promote\ncoderator I don't need to promote anything and I do not like promoting any\nanything and I do not like promoting any\nanything and I do not like promoting any codator is every code editor is good and\ncodator is every code editor is good and\ncodator is every code editor is good and I personally love VS code so you can use\nI personally love VS code so you can use\nI personally love VS code so you can use any code editor so this is the first\nany code editor so this is the first\nany code editor so this is the first thing that you need then you would need\nthing that you need then you would need\nthing that you need then you would need git why because we'll be just pushing\ngit why because we'll be just pushing\ngit why because we'll be just pushing our all the code in the GitHub so that\nour all the code in the GitHub so that\nour all the code in the GitHub so that you can also highlight your learnings in\nyou can also highlight your learnings in\nyou can also highlight your learnings in your resume and you can just attach any\nyour resume and you can just attach any\nyour resume and you can just attach any kind of thing plus it's very easy simple\nkind of thing plus it's very easy simple\nkind of thing plus it's very easy simple okay then you will need um oh yeah API\nokay then you will need um oh yeah API\nokay then you will need um oh yeah API so you would need one API\nso you would need one API\nso you would need one API It can be from openi. It can be from um\nIt can be from openi. It can be from um\nIt can be from openi. It can be from um let's say let's remove git. Let's not\nlet's say let's remove git.

In today's era, I\nanthropic or Gemini. In today's era, I\nanthropic or Gemini. In today's era, I would expect that you would have some\nwould expect that you would have some\nwould expect that you would have some API keys available to use the closed\nAPI keys available to use the closed\nAPI keys available to use the closed source uh models. I can use open source\nsource uh models. I can use open source\nsource uh models. I can use open source models as well. I have Ola installed. I\nmodels as well. I have Ola installed. I\nmodels as well. I have Ola installed. I have Docker model runner. I can install\nhave Docker model runner. I can install\nhave Docker model runner. I can install those things. But do you know what? If\nthose things. But do you know what? If\nthose things. But do you know what? If you want to create agents which can\nyou want to create agents which can\nyou want to create agents which can efficiently make tool calls, you need\nefficiently make tool calls, you need\nefficiently make tool calls, you need some highlevel models. I'm not saying\nsome highlevel models. I'm not saying\nsome highlevel models. I'm not saying that um open source models cannot\nthat um open source models cannot\nthat um open source models cannot perform this thing. But if you want to\nperform this thing. But if you want to\nperform this thing. But if you want to use those highle models with open source\nuse those highle models with open source\nuse those highle models with open source models, you need that system which can\nmodels, you need that system which can\nmodels, you need that system which can handle that particular load. And then\nhandle that particular load. And then\nhandle that particular load. And then you will say bro I do not have a an\nyou will say bro I do not have a an\nyou will say bro I do not have a an expensive laptop which can handle this\nexpensive laptop which can handle this\nexpensive laptop which can handle this thing. Obviously not everyone can have\nthing. Obviously not everyone can have\nthing. Obviously not everyone can have like expensive laptop. I'd also like\nlike expensive laptop. I'd also like\nlike expensive laptop. I'd also like have a like decent laptop. So that's why\nhave a like decent laptop. So that's why\nhave a like decent laptop. So that's why I'll be using a closed source opener\nI'll be using a closed source opener\nI'll be using a closed source opener model. Okay, I think Mac users can\nmodel. Okay, I think Mac users can\nmodel. Okay, I think Mac users can easily just um run um local models\neasily just um run um local models\neasily just um run um local models easily because they have a kind of um I\neasily because they have a kind of um I\neasily because they have a kind of um I don't need to explain that kernel thing\ndon't need to explain that kernel thing\ndon't need to explain that kernel thing now. So they can just run the models\nnow. So they can just run the models\nnow. So they can just run the models efficiently. But yeah, if you are on\nefficiently. But yeah, if you are on\nefficiently. But yeah, if you are on Windows and I'm also on Windows, you can\nWindows and I'm also on Windows, you can\nWindows and I'm also on Windows, you can just use closed source models for this\njust use closed source models for this\njust use closed source models for this particular purpose. And now let's see\nparticular purpose. And now let's see\nparticular purpose. And now let's see how you can just get started with it. So\nhow you can just get started with it. So\nhow you can just get started with it. So first of all, let's try to install VS\nfirst of all, let's try to install VS\nfirst of all, let's try to install VS code. So you can simply go to any\ncode. So you can simply go to any\ncode. So you can simply go to any browser and search VS code download. And\nbrowser and search VS code download. And\nbrowser and search VS code download. And you will get this link VS code download.\nyou will get this link VS code download.\nyou will get this link VS code download. If you are on Windows, download it. If\nIf you are on Windows, download it. If\nIf you are on Windows, download it. If you are on Debian, Ubuntu or Amazon\nyou are on Debian, Ubuntu or Amazon\nyou are on Debian, Ubuntu or Amazon Linux, you can just download it. And if\nLinux, you can just download it. And if\nLinux, you can just download it. And if you are on Mac, you can just download it\nyou are on Mac, you can just download it\nyou are on Mac, you can just download it like this. Simple. First thing is done.\nlike this. Simple. First thing is done.\nlike this. Simple. First thing is done. Then download Git.\nThen download Git.\nThen download Git. Okay? And just forget about G. Just\nOkay? And just forget about G. Just\nOkay? And just forget about G. Just forget about G. Okay? Because it will\nforget about G. Okay? Because it will\nforget about G. Okay? Because it will take extra 5 to 10 minutes. Okay? So now\ntake extra 5 to 10 minutes. Okay? So now\ntake extra 5 to 10 minutes. Okay? So now you can just go to Open AI. Simply go to\nyou can just go to Open AI. Simply go to\nyou can just go to Open AI. Simply go to OpenAI API. Simply search Open AI API\nOpenAI API. Simply search Open AI API\nOpenAI API. Simply search Open AI API search. And then you can click on API\nsearch. And then you can click on API\nsearch. And then you can click on API platform openi\nplatform openi\nplatform openi and perfect here you will land on the\nand perfect here you will land on the\nand perfect here you will land on the platform like this and I'm not talking\nplatform like this and I'm not talking\nplatform like this and I'm not talking about chat GPD okay this chat GPD is\nabout chat GPD okay this chat GPD is\nabout chat GPD okay this chat GPD is different openi is different chat GPD is\ndifferent openi is different chat GPD is\ndifferent openi is different chat GPD is just one of the products that open has\njust one of the products that open has\njust one of the products that open has built okay so you can simply go to login\nbuilt okay so you can simply go to login\nbuilt okay so you can simply go to login and click on API platform not chat GPD\nand click on API platform not chat GPD\nand click on API platform not chat GPD or cordex or sora go to API platform\nor cordex or sora go to API platform\nor cordex or sora go to API platform simple the the moment you will click\nsimple the the moment you will click\nsimple the the moment you will click here you can simply put your email\nhere you can simply put your email\nhere you can simply put your email address and you will land on your email\naddress and you will land on your email\naddress and you will land on your email or basically\nor basically\nor basically OpenAI portal. So then you will land on\nOpenAI portal. So then you will land on\nOpenAI portal. So then you will land on this kind of project page or you can say\nthis kind of project page or you can say\nthis kind of project page or you can say default page where you will see\ndefault page where you will see\ndefault page where you will see something like this. Even if you do not\nsomething like this. Even if you do not\nsomething like this. Even if you do not see anything, it will be like something\nsee anything, it will be like something\nsee anything, it will be like something else but you do not need to worry at\nelse but you do not need to worry at\nelse but you do not need to worry at all. You can simply go to this button\nall. You can simply go to this button\nall. You can simply go to this button called settings and when you click here\ncalled settings and when you click here\ncalled settings and when you click here you will land on the settings page and\nyou will land on the settings page and\nyou will land on the settings page and after clicking on the settings page you\nafter clicking on the settings page you\nafter clicking on the settings page you just need to go to this left bar and\njust need to go to this left bar and\njust need to go to this left bar and click on API keys. Simple. The moment\nclick on API keys. Simple. The moment\nclick on API keys. Simple. The moment you will click on API keys then you can\nyou will click on API keys then you can\nyou will click on API keys then you can create your new API key. Simple. So I\ncreate your new API key. Simple. So I\ncreate your new API key. Simple. So I can also create my API key. Create new\ncan also create my API key. Create new\ncan also create my API key. Create new secret API key. I can simply say\nsecret API key. I can simply say\nsecret API key. I can simply say langraph tutorial.\nlangraph tutorial.\nlangraph tutorial. I think I created one for lang chain but\nI think I created one for lang chain but\nI think I created one for lang chain but yeah let's say lang graph tutorial. This\nyeah let's say lang graph tutorial. This\nyeah let's say lang graph tutorial. This is my API key name. Project I can keep\nis my API key name. Project I can keep\nis my API key name. Project I can keep it as default project and I can click on\nit as default project and I can click on\nit as default project and I can click on create secret key. Simple and obviously\ncreate secret key. Simple and obviously\ncreate secret key. Simple and obviously I can show you because I can delete this\nI can show you because I can delete this\nI can show you because I can delete this API key as well but simply I will just\nAPI key as well but simply I will just\nAPI key as well but simply I will just keep it you can say hidden. So I have\nkeep it you can say hidden. So I have\nkeep it you can say hidden. So I have created my API key as you can see it is\ncreated my API key as you can see it is\ncreated my API key as you can see it is here and you just need to copy the API\nhere and you just need to copy the API\nhere and you just need to copy the API key immediately because after that you\nkey immediately because after that you\nkey immediately because after that you cannot copy it. Okay. So you can create\ncannot copy it. Okay. So you can create\ncannot copy it. Okay. So you can create one and then save it in your notepad or\none and then save it in your notepad or\none and then save it in your notepad or whatever because we'll be just pasting\nwhatever because we'll be just pasting\nwhatever because we'll be just pasting it in our VS code. Don't worry. So just\nit in our VS code. Don't worry. So just\nit in our VS code. Don't worry. So just for the 5 10 minutes you can simply copy\nfor the 5 10 minutes you can simply copy\nfor the 5 10 minutes you can simply copy it somewhere. Perfect. Now you'll be\nit somewhere. Perfect. Now you'll be\nit somewhere. Perfect. Now you'll be very happy. Wow we created the API key\nvery happy. Wow we created the API key\nvery happy. Wow we created the API key for free. Now we are good. Not actually\nfor free. Now we are good. Not actually\nfor free. Now we are good. Not actually now you need to go to billing. Okay. Or\nnow you need to go to billing. Okay. Or\nnow you need to go to billing. Okay. Or you can say not billing exactly. Uh I\nyou can say not billing exactly. Uh I\nyou can say not billing exactly. Uh I think yeah billing. So here you will see\nthink yeah billing. So here you will see\nthink yeah billing. So here you will see after go to billing you will see\nafter go to billing you will see\nafter go to billing you will see something pay as you go and here you can\nsomething pay as you go and here you can\nsomething pay as you go and here you can simply go to add to credit balance. You\nsimply go to add to credit balance. You\nsimply go to add to credit balance. You can add some credit. I think the default\ncan add some credit. I think the default\ncan add some credit. I think the default or minimum amount is five bucks. You can\nor minimum amount is five bucks. You can\nor minimum amount is five bucks. You can just add five bucks and then you can\njust add five bucks and then you can\njust add five bucks and then you can just use it as pay as you go model. So\njust use it as pay as you go model. So\njust use it as pay as you go model. So basically what will happen whenever you\nbasically what will happen whenever you\nbasically what will happen whenever you will make an API call it will use this\nwill make an API call it will use this\nwill make an API call it will use this amount to deduct and fulfill the task\namount to deduct and fulfill the task\namount to deduct and fulfill the task that you're doing. Um I think um if you\nthat you're doing. Um I think um if you\nthat you're doing. Um I think um if you will ask me that will $5 will be enough\nwill ask me that will $5 will be enough\nwill ask me that will $5 will be enough for this entire video. I will say more\nfor this entire video. I will say more\nfor this entire video. I will say more than enough because it's not very very\nthan enough because it's not very very\nthan enough because it's not very very you can say what what exactly you are\nyou can say what what exactly you are\nyou can say what what exactly you are thinking. So you will say $5 that means\nthinking. So you will say $5 that means\nthinking. So you will say $5 that means you will hardly make 5 10 15 20 API\nyou will hardly make 5 10 15 20 API\nyou will hardly make 5 10 15 20 API calls. Not exactly when you use OpenAI\ncalls. Not exactly when you use OpenAI\ncalls. Not exactly when you use OpenAI API for LLM for text bas based\nAPI for LLM for text bas based\nAPI for LLM for text bas based generation that you'll be just using and\ngeneration that you'll be just using and\ngeneration that you'll be just using and obviously you'll be just using normal\nobviously you'll be just using normal\nobviously you'll be just using normal models not like very very expensive\nmodels not like very very expensive\nmodels not like very very expensive models so you hardly spend I will just\nmodels so you hardly spend I will just\nmodels so you hardly spend I will just show you the chart as well and you will\nshow you the chart as well and you will\nshow you the chart as well and you will see like how much you spend when you\nsee like how much you spend when you\nsee like how much you spend when you just make an API call. So you do not\njust make an API call. So you do not\njust make an API call. So you do not need to worry about that thing because\nneed to worry about that thing because\nneed to worry about that thing because five bucks will be like more more like\nfive bucks will be like more more like\nfive bucks will be like more more like more than enough. You can just watch\nmore than enough. You can just watch\nmore than enough. You can just watch hundreds of videos like this with this\nhundreds of videos like this with this\nhundreds of videos like this with this amount and I'm not kidding. Okay. So you\namount and I'm not kidding. Okay. So you\namount and I'm not kidding. Okay. So you can simply add some amount okay in your\ncan simply add some amount okay in your\ncan simply add some amount okay in your account and you can just go with pay as\naccount and you can just go with pay as\naccount and you can just go with pay as you go. This is one way of doing it with\nyou go. This is one way of doing it with\nyou go. This is one way of doing it with openi. If you want to go with enthropic\nopeni. If you want to go with enthropic\nopeni. If you want to go with enthropic you can simply go to enthropic um API\nyou can simply go to enthropic um API\nyou can simply go to enthropic um API and then sign in and do the same stuff.\nand then sign in and do the same stuff.\nand then sign in and do the same stuff. It will be having its own particular you\nIt will be having its own particular you\nIt will be having its own particular you can say dashboard and then you can\ncan say dashboard and then you can\ncan say dashboard and then you can simply create an API key using the same\nsimply create an API key using the same\nsimply create an API key using the same thing there as well. You will need to\nthing there as well. You will need to\nthing there as well. You will need to add some mount. Same thing you can just\nadd some mount. Same thing you can just\nadd some mount. Same thing you can just go to Gemini, create the API key. And I\ngo to Gemini, create the API key. And I\ngo to Gemini, create the API key. And I think Gemini provides some free access\nthink Gemini provides some free access\nthink Gemini provides some free access to student account. If you have student\nto student account. If you have student\nto student account. If you have student account, you can just um use that\naccount, you can just um use that\naccount, you can just um use that particular thing. Okay? And you can just\nparticular thing. Okay? And you can just\nparticular thing. Okay? And you can just create the API key. In short, you can\ncreate the API key. In short, you can\ncreate the API key. In short, you can use Enthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, whatever\nuse Enthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, whatever\nuse Enthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, whatever model you want to create um or whatever\nmodel you want to create um or whatever\nmodel you want to create um or whatever provider you want to use for this\nprovider you want to use for this\nprovider you want to use for this particular tutorial because we'll be\nparticular tutorial because we'll be\nparticular tutorial because we'll be just using API calls or making API\njust using API calls or making API\njust using API calls or making API calls. Simple, simple, simple, simple.\ncalls. Simple, simple, simple, simple.\ncalls. Simple, simple, simple, simple. That's it. Once you have the key, once\nThat's it. Once you have the key, once\nThat's it. Once you have the key, once you have the amount, then you can just\nyou have the amount, then you can just\nyou have the amount, then you can just make some API calls. Make sure you have\nmake some API calls. Make sure you have\nmake some API calls. Make sure you have some amount, okay? Otherwise it will\nsome amount, okay? Otherwise it will\nsome amount, okay? Otherwise it will throw the error that hey you do not have\nthrow the error that hey you do not have\nthrow the error that hey you do not have the amount in your account and you are\nthe amount in your account and you are\nthe amount in your account and you are just trying to make the API calls trying\njust trying to make the API calls trying\njust trying to make the API calls trying to be smart right so if you do not want\nto be smart right so if you do not want\nto be smart right so if you do not want to see those errors simply have some\nto see those errors simply have some\nto see those errors simply have some amount here simple that's all and now I\namount here simple that's all and now I\namount here simple that's all and now I will quickly open my VS code editor and\nwill quickly open my VS code editor and\nwill quickly open my VS code editor and let me show you how you can just get\nlet me show you how you can just get\nlet me show you how you can just get started with it simple so this is my VS\nstarted with it simple so this is my VS\nstarted with it simple so this is my VS code editor\ncode editor\ncode editor first of all this will not be exactly\nfirst of all this will not be exactly\nfirst of all this will not be exactly like yours because I have used some\nlike yours because I have used some\nlike yours because I have used some themes themes some changes on the left\nthemes themes some changes on the left\nthemes themes some changes on the left hand side but it is fine simple you do\nhand side but it is fine simple you do\nhand side but it is fine simple you do not need to worry about that one thing\nnot need to worry about that one thing\nnot need to worry about that one thing now you need to go to file and you just\nnow you need to go to file and you just\nnow you need to go to file and you just need to click on open folder simple now\nneed to click on open folder simple now\nneed to click on open folder simple now open any empty folder it can be in C\nopen any empty folder it can be in C\nopen any empty folder it can be in C drive it can be in D drive okay make\ndrive it can be in D drive okay make\ndrive it can be in D drive okay make sure it is not in your one drive it\nsure it is not in your one drive it\nsure it is not in your one drive it doesn't make any sense to create the\ndoesn't make any sense to create the\ndoesn't make any sense to create the folder in one drive um not a big deal\nfolder in one drive um not a big deal\nfolder in one drive um not a big deal but maybe you will be having some access\nbut maybe you will be having some access\nbut maybe you will be having some access issue when you'll be just pushing that\nissue when you'll be just pushing that\nissue when you'll be just pushing that code to GitHub or whatever make a new\ncode to GitHub or whatever make a new\ncode to GitHub or whatever make a new empty folder in local disk C and then\nempty folder in local disk C and then\nempty folder in local disk C and then open that folder like this. So I have\nopen that folder like this. So I have\nopen that folder like this. So I have created a folder called lang chain\ncreated a folder called lang chain\ncreated a folder called lang chain tutorial and it is empty as you can see\ntutorial and it is empty as you can see\ntutorial and it is empty as you can see there's nothing here okay so I am\nthere's nothing here okay so I am\nthere's nothing here okay so I am working with this particular folder very\nworking with this particular folder very\nworking with this particular folder very very good now I will open the terminal\nvery good now I will open the terminal\nvery good now I will open the terminal control shift and back um not backlash\ncontrol shift and back um not backlash\ncontrol shift and back um not backlash it is called I think tick back tick so\nit is called I think tick back tick so\nit is called I think tick back tick so control shift and back tick an lamba\ncontrol shift and back tick an lamba\ncontrol shift and back tick an lamba show us the normal way okay click on\nshow us the normal way okay click on\nshow us the normal way okay click on three dots go to terminal click on new\nthree dots go to terminal click on new\nthree dots go to terminal click on new terminal and you will see the shortcut\nterminal and you will see the shortcut\nterminal and you will see the shortcut in windows you will see this in Mac you\nin windows you will see this in Mac you\nin windows you will see this in Mac you will see something else. By the way, how\nwill see something else. By the way, how\nwill see something else. By the way, how to use Mac? I have never used Mac and I\nto use Mac? I have never used Mac and I\nto use Mac? I have never used Mac and I always think like if I like how exactly\nalways think like if I like how exactly\nalways think like if I like how exactly we need to use Mac, I need a guide,\nwe need to use Mac, I need a guide,\nwe need to use Mac, I need a guide, someone who can teach me, hey, you need\nsomeone who can teach me, hey, you need\nsomeone who can teach me, hey, you need to use Mac like this. I would need a\nto use Mac like this. I would need a\nto use Mac like this. I would need a buddy. So, let's say this is my uh you\nbuddy. So, let's say this is my uh you\nbuddy. So, let's say this is my uh you can say lang lang graph tutorial and C\ncan say lang lang graph tutorial and C\ncan say lang lang graph tutorial and C drive. So, first thing first, I need to\ndrive. So, first thing first, I need to\ndrive. So, first thing first, I need to download a very special thing. It's\ndownload a very special thing. It's\ndownload a very special thing. It's called UVA. What is this? It is it like\ncalled UVA. What is this? It is it like\ncalled UVA. What is this? It is it like related to langraph? No, it is related\nrelated to langraph? No, it is related\nrelated to langraph? No, it is related to Python. So remember whenever we want\nto Python. So remember whenever we want\nto Python. So remember whenever we want to create the virtual environments.\nto create the virtual environments.\nto create the virtual environments. Yeah. So what we used to write? We used\nYeah. So what we used to write? We used\nYeah. So what we used to write? We used to write Python minus M VNV and dot VNV.\nto write Python minus M VNV and dot VNV.\nto write Python minus M VNV and dot VNV. And wait a second my ultra legendary\nAnd wait a second my ultra legendary\nAnd wait a second my ultra legendary people I forgot to mention one important\npeople I forgot to mention one important\npeople I forgot to mention one important thing. So you would need\nthing. So you would need\nthing. So you would need Python as well. Okay. We are learning\nPython as well. Okay. We are learning\nPython as well. Okay. We are learning langraph and anala where is python? Yes,\nlangraph and anala where is python? Yes,\nlangraph and anala where is python? Yes, we need python. See I thought like you\nwe need python. See I thought like you\nwe need python. See I thought like you would have some common sense. I thought\nwould have some common sense. I thought\nwould have some common sense. I thought then I\nthen I\nthen I got to know wait common sense is not\ngot to know wait common sense is not\ngot to know wait common sense is not very common nowadays. So you need python\nvery common nowadays. So you need python\nvery common nowadays. So you need python as well. Okay. So once you have\nas well. Okay. So once you have\nas well. Okay. So once you have downloaded the VS code editor you would\ndownloaded the VS code editor you would\ndownloaded the VS code editor you would also need to download the Python as\nalso need to download the Python as\nalso need to download the Python as well. So if you want to download Python\nwell. So if you want to download Python\nwell. So if you want to download Python simply go to your favorite browser click\nsimply go to your favorite browser click\nsimply go to your favorite browser click or search Python download. Simple. Go to\nor search Python download. Simple. Go to\nor search Python download. Simple. Go to download Python and here do not download\ndownload Python and here do not download\ndownload Python and here do not download directly from here. It will download the\ndirectly from here. It will download the\ndirectly from here. It will download the 3.14 which is like full of bugs. Okay.\n3.14 which is like full of bugs. Okay.\n3.14 which is like full of bugs. Okay. So now it is like bug fix\nSo now it is like bug fix\nSo now it is like bug fix error. Right now you can download 3.13.\nerror. Right now you can download 3.13.\nerror. Right now you can download 3.13. It is fine. But I personally like 3.12.\nIt is fine. But I personally like 3.12.\nIt is fine. But I personally like 3.12. It is very stable and very very good.\nIt is very stable and very very good.\nIt is very stable and very very good. Very good. And 3.13 is also in the bug\nVery good. And 3.13 is also in the bug\nVery good. And 3.13 is also in the bug fix zone. But I think 3.13 works fine\nfix zone. But I think 3.13 works fine\nfix zone. But I think 3.13 works fine for me. But 3.12 is better. So you can\nfor me. But 3.12 is better. So you can\nfor me. But 3.12 is better. So you can simply go here and download 3.12 from\nsimply go here and download 3.12 from\nsimply go here and download 3.12 from here. Download. Simple. Click on\nhere. Download. Simple. Click on\nhere. Download. Simple. Click on download and it will ask you to install\ndownload and it will ask you to install\ndownload and it will ask you to install it. Make sure that you tick the box\nit. Make sure that you tick the box\nit. Make sure that you tick the box called add dot something to path. So\ncalled add dot something to path. So\ncalled add dot something to path. So basically it will add that particular\nbasically it will add that particular\nbasically it will add that particular path to your environment variable.\npath to your environment variable.\npath to your environment variable. Simple. So you need to check that box\nSimple. So you need to check that box\nSimple. So you need to check that box and then click on install. Install\nand then click on install. Install\nand then click on install. Install install and then your Python will work\ninstall and then your Python will work\ninstall and then your Python will work fine. Okay. If you do not check that\nfine. Okay. If you do not check that\nfine. Okay. If you do not check that box, it will just throw some errors when\nbox, it will just throw some errors when\nbox, it will just throw some errors when you'll be just building virtual\nyou'll be just building virtual\nyou'll be just building virtual environments. It will just throw errors\nenvironments. It will just throw errors\nenvironments. It will just throw errors while just let's say switching the\nwhile just let's say switching the\nwhile just let's say switching the virtual environment. So, it will not\nvirtual environment. So, it will not\nvirtual environment. So, it will not actually run that interpreter. Simple,\nactually run that interpreter. Simple,\nactually run that interpreter. Simple, makes sense. Okay. Now, let's get back\nmakes sense. Okay. Now, let's get back\nmakes sense. Okay. Now, let's get back to our VS code. Simple. So, first of\nto our VS code. Simple. So, first of\nto our VS code. Simple. So, first of all, let's check our Python version. So,\nall, let's check our Python version. So,\nall, let's check our Python version. So, I will simply write Python and I am\nI will simply write Python and I am\nI will simply write Python and I am using Python 3.11.9.\nusing Python 3.11.9.\nusing Python 3.11.9. I have 3.11, I have 3.12, I have 3.13.\nI have 3.11, I have 3.12, I have 3.13.\nI have 3.11, I have 3.12, I have 3.13. Yes, but I personally currently use 3.11\nYes, but I personally currently use 3.11\nYes, but I personally currently use 3.11 because that was the Python version I\nbecause that was the Python version I\nbecause that was the Python version I used last time. So I can even change it.\nused last time. So I can even change it.\nused last time. So I can even change it. Not a big deal for me. Okay, so now I\nNot a big deal for me. Okay, so now I\nNot a big deal for me. Okay, so now I will simply say\nwill simply say\nwill simply say clear. Clear is not defined. Let's say\nclear. Clear is not defined. Let's say\nclear. Clear is not defined. Let's say exit. Ctrl C. Oh man, let me open a new\nexit. Ctrl C. Oh man, let me open a new\nexit. Ctrl C. Oh man, let me open a new terminal. So now what I was saying I was\nterminal. So now what I was saying I was\nterminal. So now what I was saying I was saying like if you want to create a new\nsaying like if you want to create a new\nsaying like if you want to create a new virtual environment you will simply say\nvirtual environment you will simply say\nvirtual environment you will simply say python minus m vnv and then dot vnv\npython minus m vnv and then dot vnv\npython minus m vnv and then dot vnv right that's the way we use with or you\nright that's the way we use with or you\nright that's the way we use with or you can say we work with virtual\ncan say we work with virtual\ncan say we work with virtual environments but we do not need to do\nenvironments but we do not need to do\nenvironments but we do not need to do this thing this is like older way to do\nthis thing this is like older way to do\nthis thing this is like older way to do it now we have UV uv manages our python\nit now we have UV uv manages our python\nit now we have UV uv manages our python packages our virtual environments our\npackages our virtual environments our\npackages our virtual environments our get everything so you simply need to\nget everything so you simply need to\nget everything so you simply need to download pip install uv and hit enter\ndownload pip install uv and hit enter\ndownload pip install uv and hit enter and which can cause conflicts\nand which can cause conflicts\nand which can cause conflicts okay we don't worry at all so it will\nokay we don't worry at all so it will\nokay we don't worry at all so it will simply say a new release of paper is\nsimply say a new release of paper is\nsimply say a new release of paper is available requirement already satisfied\navailable requirement already satisfied\navailable requirement already satisfied that means I already have UV in your\nthat means I already have UV in your\nthat means I already have UV in your case it will download UV okay and now if\ncase it will download UV okay and now if\ncase it will download UV okay and now if I write UV I will see this thing\nI write UV I will see this thing\nI write UV I will see this thing all of the information right make sense\nall of the information right make sense\nall of the information right make sense and it is saying an extremely fast\nand it is saying an extremely fast\nand it is saying an extremely fast Python packager packager Python package\nPython packager packager Python package\nPython packager packager Python package manager very good so I love UV You will\nmanager very good so I love UV You will\nmanager very good so I love UV You will also love UV after this tutorial. I'm so\nalso love UV after this tutorial. I'm so\nalso love UV after this tutorial. I'm so sure about it. And do not worry, I'm not\nsure about it. And do not worry, I'm not\nsure about it. And do not worry, I'm not the creator of UV. I am simply using UV.\nthe creator of UV. I am simply using UV.\nthe creator of UV. I am simply using UV. I'm simply educating you about UV. So\nI'm simply educating you about UV. So\nI'm simply educating you about UV. So now I'll be just using UV for\nnow I'll be just using UV for\nnow I'll be just using UV for everything. So now if I want to\neverything. So now if I want to\neverything. So now if I want to initialize my virtual environment and\ninitialize my virtual environment and\ninitialize my virtual environment and everything. I simply need to run this\neverything. I simply need to run this\neverything. I simply need to run this command. UV init. And that's it. UV\ncommand. UV init. And that's it. UV\ncommand. UV init. And that's it. UV init. And that's it. Hit enter.\ninit. And that's it. Hit enter.\ninit. And that's it. Hit enter. And you will see some files\nAnd you will see some files\nAnd you will see some files automatically created for you. dot get\nautomatically created for you. dot get\nautomatically created for you. dot get ignore python version main.py PY toml\nignore python version main.py PY toml\nignore python version main.py PY toml file readme UV created all the all of\nfile readme UV created all the all of\nfile readme UV created all the all of these files simple and I can go to my\nthese files simple and I can go to my\nthese files simple and I can go to my Python version in your case it will get\nPython version in your case it will get\nPython version in your case it will get by default Python version that it has\nby default Python version that it has\nby default Python version that it has right and in my case it has picked 3.12\nright and in my case it has picked 3.12\nright and in my case it has picked 3.12 I can even change to 3 3.1 3.13 whatever\nI can even change to 3 3.1 3.13 whatever\nI can even change to 3 3.1 3.13 whatever but 3.12 is fine so now you need to run\nbut 3.12 is fine so now you need to run\nbut 3.12 is fine so now you need to run one more command u sync because it will\none more command u sync because it will\none more command u sync because it will create the virtual moment for you with\ncreate the virtual moment for you with\ncreate the virtual moment for you with this\nthis\nthis perfect now you can see virtual moment\nperfect now you can see virtual moment\nperfect now you can see virtual moment is created simple if you do not see\nis created simple if you do not see\nis created simple if you do not see do.get folder do not worry at all\ndo.get folder do not worry at all\ndo.get folder do not worry at all because you either do not have the git\nbecause you either do not have the git\nbecause you either do not have the git installed or you have made this folder\ninstalled or you have made this folder\ninstalled or you have made this folder as hidden and if it is hidden it is good\nas hidden and if it is hidden it is good\nas hidden and if it is hidden it is good for you so that you can just you cannot\nfor you so that you can just you cannot\nfor you so that you can just you cannot change anything in this thing because\nchange anything in this thing because\nchange anything in this thing because get folder is very very critical you\nget folder is very very critical you\nget folder is very very critical you should not touch it so just ignore so\nshould not touch it so just ignore so\nshould not touch it so just ignore so now what I will do I will simply say\nnow what I will do I will simply say\nnow what I will do I will simply say dovn\nscripts and then activate basically I\nscripts and then activate basically I want to activate the virtual environment\nwant to activate the virtual environment\nwant to activate the virtual environment make sense in uh I think Mac it is also\nmake sense in uh I think Mac it is also\nmake sense in uh I think Mac it is also similar I think VNV you can simply go to\nsimilar I think VNV you can simply go to\nsimilar I think VNV you can simply go to this folder and you will see VNV and\nthis folder and you will see VNV and\nthis folder and you will see VNV and because I hardly use Mac so I can simply\nbecause I hardly use Mac so I can simply\nbecause I hardly use Mac so I can simply search it for you if you want to\nsearch it for you if you want to\nsearch it for you if you want to activate virtual environment in Mac and\nactivate virtual environment in Mac and\nactivate virtual environment in Mac and there's nothing to judge in this I don't\nthere's nothing to judge in this I don't\nthere's nothing to judge in this I don't use Mac I do not use Mac I don't like\nuse Mac I do not use Mac I don't like\nuse Mac I do not use Mac I don't like Mac why do I need to learn the commands\nMac why do I need to learn the commands\nMac why do I need to learn the commands for it so yeah it is yeah in Mac is\nfor it so yeah it is yeah in Mac is\nfor it so yeah it is yeah in Mac is source virtual name which is dot VNV\nsource virtual name which is dot VNV\nsource virtual name which is dot VNV then bin then activate. In our case in\nthen bin then activate. In our case in\nthen bin then activate. In our case in Windows users it is VNV then sources not\nWindows users it is VNV then sources not\nWindows users it is VNV then sources not sources scripts scripts and then\nsources scripts scripts and then\nsources scripts scripts and then activate. Simple. Okay. Perfect. So this\nactivate. Simple. Okay. Perfect. So this\nactivate. Simple. Okay. Perfect. So this is the command that we have to run and\nis the command that we have to run and\nis the command that we have to run and let me just hit enter and you will see\nlet me just hit enter and you will see\nlet me just hit enter and you will see this virtual environment created. See.\nthis virtual environment created. See.\nthis virtual environment created. See. Wow. Now if I write Python\nWow. Now if I write Python\nWow. Now if I write Python you will see 3.12 not 3.11 because 3.11\nyou will see 3.12 not 3.11 because 3.11\nyou will see 3.12 not 3.11 because 3.11 is running in my global environment. But\nis running in my global environment. But\nis running in my global environment. But for this virtual environment, I'm using\nfor this virtual environment, I'm using\nfor this virtual environment, I'm using my 3.12 interpreter because I have both\nmy 3.12 interpreter because I have both\nmy 3.12 interpreter because I have both installed. If you have just one\ninstalled. If you have just one\ninstalled. If you have just one interpreter installed, it will just show\ninterpreter installed, it will just show\ninterpreter installed, it will just show you one. If you have multiple, it can\nyou one. If you have multiple, it can\nyou one. If you have multiple, it can just you can just change it from here as\njust you can just change it from here as\njust you can just change it from here as well. But to be honest, it's fine\nwell. But to be honest, it's fine\nwell. But to be honest, it's fine because Python version after 3.9 or 10,\nbecause Python version after 3.9 or 10,\nbecause Python version after 3.9 or 10, it's the same. But before that, it can\nit's the same. But before that, it can\nit's the same. But before that, it can cause some problem. So just make sure\ncause some problem. So just make sure\ncause some problem. So just make sure that you have the 3.10 or 11 above\nthat you have the 3.10 or 11 above\nthat you have the 3.10 or 11 above version. It's better. Simple. Okay. Very\nversion. It's better. Simple. Okay. Very\nversion. It's better. Simple. Okay. Very good. That's all that we need to do with\ngood. That's all that we need to do with\ngood. That's all that we need to do with UV and we are good. Now we will be just\nUV and we are good. Now we will be just\nUV and we are good. Now we will be just creating some folders. Simple. Okay. Now\ncreating some folders. Simple. Okay. Now\ncreating some folders. Simple. Okay. Now here you will see that I will be using\nhere you will see that I will be using\nhere you will see that I will be using some lang chain libraries as well. But\nsome lang chain libraries as well. But\nsome lang chain libraries as well. But those lang chain libraries are just the\nthose lang chain libraries are just the\nthose lang chain libraries are just the packages that we use to work with\npackages that we use to work with\npackages that we use to work with langraph.\nlangraph.\nlangraph. Do not feel like I am writing lang chain\nDo not feel like I am writing lang chain\nDo not feel like I am writing lang chain so I need to know everything in lang.\nso I need to know everything in lang.\nso I need to know everything in lang. No. If you already know about lang chain\nNo. If you already know about lang chain\nNo. If you already know about lang chain it is good. If not I will try my best to\nit is good. If not I will try my best to\nit is good. If not I will try my best to cover all of the things that are\ncover all of the things that are\ncover all of the things that are required for you to know in the field of\nrequired for you to know in the field of\nrequired for you to know in the field of langraph. Simple because the things that\nlangraph. Simple because the things that\nlangraph. Simple because the things that we need in langraph from langchain are\nwe need in langraph from langchain are\nwe need in langraph from langchain are very simple are like something that when\nvery simple are like something that when\nvery simple are like something that when you see it at once you understand it\nyou see it at once you understand it\nyou see it at once you understand it immediately. It's not something like out\nimmediately. It's not something like out\nimmediately. It's not something like out of this world. It's not something a kind\nof this world. It's not something a kind\nof this world. It's not something a kind of new concept. If it would be a new\nof new concept. If it would be a new\nof new concept. If it would be a new concept or a different concept I will\nconcept or a different concept I will\nconcept or a different concept I will explain it to you. Otherwise I will\nexplain it to you. Otherwise I will\nexplain it to you. Otherwise I will simply say write this code this is for\nsimply say write this code this is for\nsimply say write this code this is for this purpose and that's it simple I hope\nthis purpose and that's it simple I hope\nthis purpose and that's it simple I hope the expect expectations are set because\nthe expect expectations are set because\nthe expect expectations are set because see if you are new you can feel confused\nsee if you are new you can feel confused\nsee if you are new you can feel confused hey like we are learning lang graph and\nhey like we are learning lang graph and\nhey like we are learning lang graph and this is writing lang chain so do not\nthis is writing lang chain so do not\nthis is writing lang chain so do not worry at all those are simply the\nworry at all those are simply the\nworry at all those are simply the packages simple very good so now I will\npackages simple very good so now I will\npackages simple very good so now I will simply install some of the things and\nsimply install some of the things and\nsimply install some of the things and before installing it I will create one\nbefore installing it I will create one\nbefore installing it I will create one very important file just click on this\nvery important file just click on this\nvery important file just click on this plus new file and create env.\nplus new file and create env.\nplus new file and create env. Okay. So here you need to create the\nOkay. So here you need to create the\nOkay. So here you need to create the environment file and here I need to\nenvironment file and here I need to\nenvironment file and here I need to create one environment variable. It's\ncreate one environment variable. It's\ncreate one environment variable. It's called open AI API key. Simple.\ncalled open AI API key. Simple.\ncalled open AI API key. Simple. And here I will paste my open AI API key\nAnd here I will paste my open AI API key\nAnd here I will paste my open AI API key in double quotes. Simple. You can also\nin double quotes. Simple. You can also\nin double quotes. Simple. You can also um create this variable and save it.\num create this variable and save it.\num create this variable and save it. Control S. Simple. Obviously I will not\nControl S. Simple. Obviously I will not\nControl S. Simple. Obviously I will not show you this thing. So I will create\nshow you this thing. So I will create\nshow you this thing. So I will create one more file for you so that you can\none more file for you so that you can\none more file for you so that you can see all of the variables.\nsee all of the variables.\nsee all of the variables. Env.ample\nand I will simply say\nand I will simply say open AI\nopen AI\nopen AI API key equals to.\nSo this is basically the best practice\nSo this is basically the best practice that we do when we need to just push our\nthat we do when we need to just push our\nthat we do when we need to just push our code to GitHub and obviously I will push\ncode to GitHub and obviously I will push\ncode to GitHub and obviously I will push our push my code to GitHub. You can see\nour push my code to GitHub. You can see\nour push my code to GitHub. You can see this file just for the reference and you\nthis file just for the reference and you\nthis file just for the reference and you can create your own env file using the\ncan create your own env file using the\ncan create your own env file using the same thing using same variables. So now\nsame thing using same variables. So now\nsame thing using same variables. So now if you are using let's say anthropic\nif you are using let's say anthropic\nif you are using let's say anthropic then you can just write entropic API\nthen you can just write entropic API\nthen you can just write entropic API key.\nkey.\nkey. Okay. If you are using Gemini I think it\nOkay. If you are using Gemini I think it\nOkay. If you are using Gemini I think it is called Gemini API key.\nis called Gemini API key.\nis called Gemini API key. I can just confirm. Don't worry at all.\nI can just confirm. Don't worry at all.\nI can just confirm. Don't worry at all. But for OpenAI an entropic it's\nBut for OpenAI an entropic it's\nBut for OpenAI an entropic it's confirmed. For Gemini I can I can just\nconfirmed. For Gemini I can I can just\nconfirmed. For Gemini I can I can just confirm right now. So let's say\nconfirm right now. So let's say\nconfirm right now. So let's say Gemini\nGemini\nGemini lang chain chat Google API integration.\nlang chain chat Google API integration.\nlang chain chat Google API integration. Yes, this is the one. So what is the key\nYes, this is the one. So what is the key\nYes, this is the one. So what is the key name? Let me just check.\nname? Let me just check.\nname? Let me just check. Oh, it's called Google API call key, not\nOh, it's called Google API call key, not\nOh, it's called Google API call key, not Geminina API key. Okay, so let me just\nGeminina API key. Okay, so let me just\nGeminina API key. Okay, so let me just write it for you. So you can just go\nwrite it for you. So you can just go\nwrite it for you. So you can just go here and it is called Google API key.\nhere and it is called Google API key.\nhere and it is called Google API key. Simple. Okay, make sense? Google API key\nSimple. Okay, make sense? Google API key\nSimple. Okay, make sense? Google API key and okay okay chat Gemini yeah Gemini is\nand okay okay chat Gemini yeah Gemini is\nand okay okay chat Gemini yeah Gemini is the model Google is the API key perfect\nthe model Google is the API key perfect\nthe model Google is the API key perfect and I can similarly look at the entropic\nand I can similarly look at the entropic\nand I can similarly look at the entropic quickly just to confirm\nquickly just to confirm\nquickly just to confirm so for entropic\nso for entropic\nso for entropic this is the one yeah entropic is like\nthis is the one yeah entropic is like\nthis is the one yeah entropic is like entropic API key simple very good so now\nentropic API key simple very good so now\nentropic API key simple very good so now your environment is created now you are\nyour environment is created now you are\nyour environment is created now you are just good to go with the next steps\njust good to go with the next steps\njust good to go with the next steps simple very good so here I have just\nsimple very good so here I have just\nsimple very good so here I have just pasted my API key as well I will just\npasted my API key as well I will just\npasted my API key as well I will just simply remove it. Do not worry. Do not\nsimply remove it. Do not worry. Do not\nsimply remove it. Do not worry. Do not feel happy. And by the way, this is not\nfeel happy. And by the way, this is not\nfeel happy. And by the way, this is not a complete API. It's like very big.\na complete API. It's like very big.\na complete API. It's like very big. Okay. So this is my API key. Open API\nOkay. So this is my API key. Open API\nOkay. So this is my API key. Open API key. In your case, you can just paste it\nkey. In your case, you can just paste it\nkey. In your case, you can just paste it here. In case of Google, you can just\nhere. In case of Google, you can just\nhere. In case of Google, you can just paste it here. Simple. So now let me\npaste it here. Simple. So now let me\npaste it here. Simple. So now let me just create a quick folder or just you\njust create a quick folder or just you\njust create a quick folder or just you can say a Python file is enough. Y I\ncan say a Python file is enough. Y I\ncan say a Python file is enough. Y I would say yeah. So here. Perfect. So I\nwould say yeah. So here. Perfect. So I\nwould say yeah. So here. Perfect. So I will create one and then I can say\nwill create one and then I can say\nwill create one and then I can say basics. py because obviously this master\nbasics. py because obviously this master\nbasics. py because obviously this master class is structured in the form of\nclass is structured in the form of\nclass is structured in the form of chapters so that you can just learn step\nchapters so that you can just learn step\nchapters so that you can just learn step by step so that's why I'll be just using\nby step so that's why I'll be just using\nby step so that's why I'll be just using the naming convention called like 1 2 3\nthe naming convention called like 1 2 3\nthe naming convention called like 1 2 3 4 5 so on simple okay very good so now\n4 5 so on simple okay very good so now\n4 5 so on simple okay very good so now you can even remove main py this is a\nyou can even remove main py this is a\nyou can even remove main py this is a default Python notebook that your UV\ndefault Python notebook that your UV\ndefault Python notebook that your UV creates okay so now I simply need to\ncreates okay so now I simply need to\ncreates okay so now I simply need to just show you some of the packages that\njust show you some of the packages that\njust show you some of the packages that you would need to install with your\nyou would need to install with your\nyou would need to install with your langraph. Simple. So first of all, let\nlangraph. Simple. So first of all, let\nlangraph. Simple. So first of all, let me just tell you whenever you want to\nme just tell you whenever you want to\nme just tell you whenever you want to install any package, you can install\ninstall any package, you can install\ninstall any package, you can install directly with your requirements.xt\ndirectly with your requirements.xt\ndirectly with your requirements.xt because in my case or you can say in\nbecause in my case or you can say in\nbecause in my case or you can say in your case, you will use my GitHub repo,\nyour case, you will use my GitHub repo,\nyour case, you will use my GitHub repo, right? So you will also see one file\nright? So you will also see one file\nright? So you will also see one file called requirements.txt.\ncalled requirements.txt.\ncalled requirements.txt. Simple. I will also show you how you can\nSimple. I will also show you how you can\nSimple. I will also show you how you can just create it. So when you create like\njust create it. So when you create like\njust create it. So when you create like requirements.txt, you can download that\nrequirements.txt, you can download that\nrequirements.txt, you can download that particular all the packages step by\nparticular all the packages step by\nparticular all the packages step by step. It's not a big deal. Simple. And\nstep. It's not a big deal. Simple. And\nstep. It's not a big deal. Simple. And if you just want to download all of the\nif you just want to download all of the\nif you just want to download all of the packages that you would need here for\npackages that you would need here for\npackages that you would need here for your this particular course, you can\nyour this particular course, you can\nyour this particular course, you can just create one requirements.txt. And\njust create one requirements.txt. And\njust create one requirements.txt. And let me just paste that requirements.txt\nlet me just paste that requirements.txt\nlet me just paste that requirements.txt here. And let's say I will simply add\nrequirements.txt. And here I can just\nrequirements.txt. And here I can just paste all of the packages. Currently it\npaste all of the packages. Currently it\npaste all of the packages. Currently it is empty. Not a big deal. But yes, if\nis empty. Not a big deal. But yes, if\nis empty. Not a big deal. But yes, if you want to install anything, you can\nyou want to install anything, you can\nyou want to install anything, you can simply go to the terminal uh and simply\nsimply go to the terminal uh and simply\nsimply go to the terminal uh and simply search UV, not search, simply type UV,\nsearch UV, not search, simply type UV,\nsearch UV, not search, simply type UV, then add UV add and then minus R\nthen add UV add and then minus R\nthen add UV add and then minus R requirements dot txt. In Python, we\nrequirements dot txt. In Python, we\nrequirements dot txt. In Python, we simply say pip install or you can say\nsimply say pip install or you can say\nsimply say pip install or you can say pip install minus r requirements.txt.\npip install minus r requirements.txt.\npip install minus r requirements.txt. Right? So here we simply say UV add\nRight? So here we simply say UV add\nRight? So here we simply say UV add minus r requirements dot txt. Hit enter.\nminus r requirements dot txt. Hit enter.\nminus r requirements dot txt. Hit enter. And obviously it is empty so it will not\nAnd obviously it is empty so it will not\nAnd obviously it is empty so it will not install anything. When you will download\ninstall anything. When you will download\ninstall anything. When you will download my requirements.txt from GitHub then you\nmy requirements.txt from GitHub then you\nmy requirements.txt from GitHub then you can obviously run this command and it\ncan obviously run this command and it\ncan obviously run this command and it will automatically download all of the\nwill automatically download all of the\nwill automatically download all of the packages in your case. So you just need\npackages in your case. So you just need\npackages in your case. So you just need to chill simple but obviously I do not\nto chill simple but obviously I do not\nto chill simple but obviously I do not have any package right now. So let me\nhave any package right now. So let me\nhave any package right now. So let me just install some of the packages. So\njust install some of the packages. So\njust install some of the packages. So first package that I want to install is\nfirst package that I want to install is\nfirst package that I want to install is lang chain openi. So I will write uv. So\nlang chain openi. So I will write uv. So\nlang chain openi. So I will write uv. So whenever I want to add any package\nwhenever I want to add any package\nwhenever I want to add any package instead of writing pip install that\ninstead of writing pip install that\ninstead of writing pip install that package name name I just simply need to\npackage name name I just simply need to\npackage name name I just simply need to type uv add and that's it and it will\ntype uv add and that's it and it will\ntype uv add and that's it and it will automatically add that particular\nautomatically add that particular\nautomatically add that particular package for me. That is a kind of um\npackage for me. That is a kind of um\npackage for me. That is a kind of um thing that we add or you can say do in\nthing that we add or you can say do in\nthing that we add or you can say do in uv simple okay so let me just add two to\nuv simple okay so let me just add two to\nuv simple okay so let me just add two to three basic packages. So it will be like\nthree basic packages. So it will be like\nthree basic packages. So it will be like lang chain\num core.\num core. So, Langchain core is downloaded along\nSo, Langchain core is downloaded along\nSo, Langchain core is downloaded along with some amazing other dependencies as\nwith some amazing other dependencies as\nwith some amazing other dependencies as well. And as you can see, my lang\nwell. And as you can see, my lang\nwell. And as you can see, my lang package is 1.1 1.0 plus I think. Yeah.\npackage is 1.1 1.0 plus I think. Yeah.\npackage is 1.1 1.0 plus I think. Yeah. So, it is 1.2 because this is the latest\nSo, it is 1.2 because this is the latest\nSo, it is 1.2 because this is the latest one and it has like some amazing changes\none and it has like some amazing changes\none and it has like some amazing changes in langraph as well. So, yeah. Okay. And\nin langraph as well. So, yeah. Okay. And\nin langraph as well. So, yeah. Okay. And after that I can simply um add UV add\nafter that I can simply um add UV add\nafter that I can simply um add UV add lang chain then open. If you're using\nlang chain then open. If you're using\nlang chain then open. If you're using entropic, you have to download lang\nentropic, you have to download lang\nentropic, you have to download lang chain, entropic. Let me just show you.\nchain, entropic. Let me just show you.\nchain, entropic. Let me just show you. Let's say lang chain\nLet's say lang chain\nLet's say lang chain and entropic.\nand entropic.\nand entropic. Simple. So it will download all of these\nSimple. So it will download all of these\nSimple. So it will download all of these things. If you are using um you can say\nthings. If you are using um you can say\nthings. If you are using um you can say um Gemini then you can simply get that\num Gemini then you can simply get that\num Gemini then you can simply get that specific package. So you can get the\nspecific package. So you can get the\nspecific package. So you can get the package from let's say\npackage from let's say\npackage from let's say where is that model? uh Google Google\nwhere is that model? uh Google Google\nwhere is that model? uh Google Google LLM. Okay.\nLLM. Okay.\nLLM. Okay. So I think it is lang Google but still I\nSo I think it is lang Google but still I\nSo I think it is lang Google but still I can just simply confirm before telling\ncan just simply confirm before telling\ncan just simply confirm before telling you. Yeah. So you can simply download\nyou. Yeah. So you can simply download\nyou. Yeah. So you can simply download this package. Langchain Google Chenai.\nthis package. Langchain Google Chenai.\nthis package. Langchain Google Chenai. Simple. So our package is completed.\nSimple. So our package is completed.\nSimple. So our package is completed. Very good. Now I need to create a\nVery good. Now I need to create a\nVery good. Now I need to create a connection with the um LLM. So that is\nconnection with the um LLM. So that is\nconnection with the um LLM. So that is why I have just considered this basics\nwhy I have just considered this basics\nwhy I have just considered this basics file where you can simply create a basic\nfile where you can simply create a basic\nfile where you can simply create a basic connection and then you can just get\nconnection and then you can just get\nconnection and then you can just get started with it. Now you can get started\nstarted with it. Now you can get started\nstarted with it. Now you can get started with your tutorial Python with Python\nwith your tutorial Python with Python\nwith your tutorial Python with Python scripts but personally I like writing my\nscripts but personally I like writing my\nscripts but personally I like writing my code in the form of cells basically the\ncode in the form of cells basically the\ncode in the form of cells basically the notebooks the same way we write our code\nnotebooks the same way we write our code\nnotebooks the same way we write our code in the Jupyter notebook. Okay so this is\nin the Jupyter notebook. Okay so this is\nin the Jupyter notebook. Okay so this is very similar to that. So if you want to\nvery similar to that. So if you want to\nvery similar to that. So if you want to get started with the master class with\nget started with the master class with\nget started with the master class with notebook, you can simply change the\nnotebook, you can simply change the\nnotebook, you can simply change the file format to dot ipi kernel. Okay, I\nfile format to dot ipi kernel. Okay, I\nfile format to dot ipi kernel. Okay, I python notebook IP YB. Simply save it\npython notebook IP YB. Simply save it\npython notebook IP YB. Simply save it and then it will become your Jupyter\nand then it will become your Jupyter\nand then it will become your Jupyter notebook. Simple, very good. Now when\nnotebook. Simple, very good. Now when\nnotebook. Simple, very good. Now when you'll be selecting the kernel, let's\nyou'll be selecting the kernel, let's\nyou'll be selecting the kernel, let's say select kernel, just make sure you\nsay select kernel, just make sure you\nsay select kernel, just make sure you have Python environments. In your case,\nhave Python environments. In your case,\nhave Python environments. In your case, you will not see collab. This is\nyou will not see collab. This is\nyou will not see collab. This is basically a kind of extension that I\nbasically a kind of extension that I\nbasically a kind of extension that I have downloaded. If I want to connect to\nhave downloaded. If I want to connect to\nhave downloaded. If I want to connect to collab notebook but this is like out of\ncollab notebook but this is like out of\ncollab notebook but this is like out of scope for you like you can use Google\nscope for you like you can use Google\nscope for you like you can use Google collab as well because you get the free\ncollab as well because you get the free\ncollab as well because you get the free GPUs but that is not required for this\nGPUs but that is not required for this\nGPUs but that is not required for this course because we are using closed\ncourse because we are using closed\ncourse because we are using closed source um LLMs simple. So let me just\nsource um LLMs simple. So let me just\nsource um LLMs simple. So let me just select select kernel Python environments\nselect select kernel Python environments\nselect select kernel Python environments and here you can just pick this\nand here you can just pick this\nand here you can just pick this particular environment. Simple do not\nparticular environment. Simple do not\nparticular environment. Simple do not pick global environment. No, you simply\npick global environment. No, you simply\npick global environment. No, you simply need to pick Langra. Simple. Okay, let\nneed to pick Langra. Simple. Okay, let\nneed to pick Langra. Simple. Okay, let me just pick it. And this time you can\nme just pick it. And this time you can\nme just pick it. And this time you can see this thing. Perfect. Let me just\nsee this thing. Perfect. Let me just\nsee this thing. Perfect. Let me just save it. Very good. So here I will just\nsave it. Very good. So here I will just\nsave it. Very good. So here I will just show you one code and this code will be\nshow you one code and this code will be\nshow you one code and this code will be there in every notebook because in every\nthere in every notebook because in every\nthere in every notebook because in every notebook we will be using LLM right to\nnotebook we will be using LLM right to\nnotebook we will be using LLM right to make AI agents agent whatever. So there\nmake AI agents agent whatever. So there\nmake AI agents agent whatever. So there is one boilerplate code kind of\nis one boilerplate code kind of\nis one boilerplate code kind of boilerplate code that we will write in\nboilerplate code that we will write in\nboilerplate code that we will write in every notebook but you need to\nevery notebook but you need to\nevery notebook but you need to understand that as well. First of all,\nunderstand that as well. First of all,\nunderstand that as well. First of all, you need to create one code cell simple\nyou need to create one code cell simple\nyou need to create one code cell simple and then I will write from let's say\nand then I will write from let's say\nand then I will write from let's say langchain dot core and then let's say\nlangchain dot core and then let's say\nlangchain dot core and then let's say you want to import chat models. Now\nyou want to import chat models. Now\nyou want to import chat models. Now there are two options to import the chat\nthere are two options to import the chat\nthere are two options to import the chat models. There was like initial way okay\nmodels. There was like initial way okay\nmodels. There was like initial way okay which is still used. It's not like it is\nwhich is still used. It's not like it is\nwhich is still used. It's not like it is not used now. But if you just want to\nnot used now. But if you just want to\nnot used now. But if you just want to use the new method, you can still use\nuse the new method, you can still use\nuse the new method, you can still use the new method if you want to. So let me\nthe new method if you want to. So let me\nthe new method if you want to. So let me show you how you can just do that. So if\nshow you how you can just do that. So if\nshow you how you can just do that. So if I will personally refer this course to\nI will personally refer this course to\nI will personally refer this course to open AI and it is exactly the same in\nopen AI and it is exactly the same in\nopen AI and it is exactly the same in every other thing as well. So let's say\nevery other thing as well. So let's say\nevery other thing as well. So let's say open\nopen\nopen and here if you go to chat open perfect.\nand here if you go to chat open perfect.\nand here if you go to chat open perfect. So here you will see where is that new\nSo here you will see where is that new\nSo here you will see where is that new meth method. Yeah. So this is the older\nmeth method. Yeah. So this is the older\nmeth method. Yeah. So this is the older method that I personally like from\nmethod that I personally like from\nmethod that I personally like from langchain openi. You can simply say\nlangchain openi. You can simply say\nlangchain openi. You can simply say import chat openi simple but right now\nimport chat openi simple but right now\nimport chat openi simple but right now they have just simply created one more\nthey have just simply created one more\nthey have just simply created one more generic class where you do not need to\ngeneric class where you do not need to\ngeneric class where you do not need to connect specifically to openai. You can\nconnect specifically to openai. You can\nconnect specifically to openai. You can connect to any other you can say model\nconnect to any other you can say model\nconnect to any other you can say model gemini model entropic model and you do\ngemini model entropic model and you do\ngemini model entropic model and you do not need to worry about any kind of\nnot need to worry about any kind of\nnot need to worry about any kind of dedicated connector but I personally\ndedicated connector but I personally\ndedicated connector but I personally like this particular method. Okay. So I\nlike this particular method. Okay. So I\nlike this particular method. Okay. So I will prefer you using this one. It's\nwill prefer you using this one. It's\nwill prefer you using this one. It's pretty much straightforward and more\npretty much straightforward and more\npretty much straightforward and more readable. So let me just go to my VS\nreadable. So let me just go to my VS\nreadable. So let me just go to my VS code. So I will simply write it here.\ncode. So I will simply write it here.\ncode. So I will simply write it here. This thing from lang openi import chat\nThis thing from lang openi import chat\nThis thing from lang openi import chat openai. Simple\nopenai. Simple\nopenai. Simple makes sense. So here I want to now\nmakes sense. So here I want to now\nmakes sense. So here I want to now create an LLM object. Simple. Now I know\ncreate an LLM object. Simple. Now I know\ncreate an LLM object. Simple. Now I know that in chat open or basically open I\nthat in chat open or basically open I\nthat in chat open or basically open I have so many models basically chat\nhave so many models basically chat\nhave so many models basically chat models. I have GPD 4.1 mini. I have I\nmodels. I have GPD 4.1 mini. I have I\nmodels. I have GPD 4.1 mini. I have I think 4 5.1 as well this as well and 4.1\nthink 4 5.1 as well this as well and 4.1\nthink 4 5.1 as well this as well and 4.1 mini as well 40 mini as well there are\nmini as well 40 mini as well there are\nmini as well 40 mini as well there are so many models and if I just go to the\nso many models and if I just go to the\nso many models and if I just go to the list you can literally see that we have\nlist you can literally see that we have\nlist you can literally see that we have a long list so openai\nmodels simple so here you will see a\nmodels simple so here you will see a long list of it and you can pick any\nlong list of it and you can pick any\nlong list of it and you can pick any model I will just tell you which is the\nmodel I will just tell you which is the\nmodel I will just tell you which is the best one for this particular course um I\nbest one for this particular course um I\nbest one for this particular course um I think you can the GPD5 mini. Okay,\nthink you can the GPD5 mini. Okay,\nthink you can the GPD5 mini. Okay, simple.\nsimple.\nsimple. This is a good model by the way, but\nThis is a good model by the way, but\nThis is a good model by the way, but this is a little bit costly because you\nthis is a little bit costly because you\nthis is a little bit costly because you can see $0.25 for input per 1 million\ncan see $0.25 for input per 1 million\ncan see $0.25 for input per 1 million token and $2 for output. Still, it is\ntoken and $2 for output. Still, it is\ntoken and $2 for output. Still, it is like more than enough. But we will just\nlike more than enough. But we will just\nlike more than enough. But we will just simply pick the cheap options. So, I\nsimply pick the cheap options. So, I\nsimply pick the cheap options. So, I will simply go to let's say GPT5 Nano\nwill simply go to let's say GPT5 Nano\nwill simply go to let's say GPT5 Nano and you will see this is very good.\nand you will see this is very good.\nand you will see this is very good. $0.05 for input and $0.4 $4 for output\n$0.05 for input and $0.4 $4 for output\n$0.05 for input and $0.4 $4 for output and this will perform almost all the\nand this will perform almost all the\nand this will perform almost all the stuff that we want to perform here.\nstuff that we want to perform here.\nstuff that we want to perform here. Simple. There are some more other\nSimple. There are some more other\nSimple. There are some more other options as well, but I would say this is\noptions as well, but I would say this is\noptions as well, but I would say this is the best one. GBT5 nano. So I can just\nthe best one. GBT5 nano. So I can just\nthe best one. GBT5 nano. So I can just copy the name here and I can just go to\ncopy the name here and I can just go to\ncopy the name here and I can just go to my VS code and I can just paste it here.\nmy VS code and I can just paste it here.\nmy VS code and I can just paste it here. So I will remove it and I will paste it\nSo I will remove it and I will paste it\nSo I will remove it and I will paste it here. I can remove the date because date\nhere. I can remove the date because date\nhere. I can remove the date because date is just for the last updated date at it\nis just for the last updated date at it\nis just for the last updated date at it was updated. So GBD5 nano you can create\nwas updated. So GBD5 nano you can create\nwas updated. So GBD5 nano you can create this instance or basically object of\nthis instance or basically object of\nthis instance or basically object of LLM. Now after this step, after this\nLLM. Now after this step, after this\nLLM. Now after this step, after this step everything is same. If you are\nstep everything is same. If you are\nstep everything is same. If you are using Google, Gemini, Anthropic, any\nusing Google, Gemini, Anthropic, any\nusing Google, Gemini, Anthropic, any model, everything is same. Only these\nmodel, everything is same. Only these\nmodel, everything is same. Only these two lines are different.\ntwo lines are different.\ntwo lines are different. Simple. Only these two lines are\nSimple. Only these two lines are\nSimple. Only these two lines are different. In case of chat, OpenAI, you\ndifferent. In case of chat, OpenAI, you\ndifferent. In case of chat, OpenAI, you have to just use OpenAI and then chat\nhave to just use OpenAI and then chat\nhave to just use OpenAI and then chat OpenAI.\nOpenAI.\nOpenAI. In case of Google Gemini, I have already\nIn case of Google Gemini, I have already\nIn case of Google Gemini, I have already showed you. Still I can just show you\nshowed you. Still I can just show you\nshowed you. Still I can just show you again. Let's say you are using entropic.\nagain. Let's say you are using entropic.\nagain. Let's say you are using entropic. So here you can simply use this code um\nSo here you can simply use this code um\nSo here you can simply use this code um let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say from lang chain entropic import chat\nfrom lang chain entropic import chat\nfrom lang chain entropic import chat entropic and obviously you can just pick\nentropic and obviously you can just pick\nentropic and obviously you can just pick any model you can pick claude haiku 45\nany model you can pick claude haiku 45\nany model you can pick claude haiku 45 or you can pick sonnet 45 because opus\nor you can pick sonnet 45 because opus\nor you can pick sonnet 45 because opus is expensive so haiku or sonnet is fine\nis expensive so haiku or sonnet is fine\nis expensive so haiku or sonnet is fine simple and if you're using Google the\nsimple and if you're using Google the\nsimple and if you're using Google the same way click here on the google and\nsame way click here on the google and\nsame way click here on the google and here you will see the google code as\nhere you will see the google code as\nhere you will see the google code as well\nwell\nwell and let's See where is that? Okay,\nand let's See where is that? Okay,\nand let's See where is that? Okay, perfect. So here you can simply define\nperfect. So here you can simply define\nperfect. So here you can simply define Gemini 3 Pro preview or Gemini 3 Pro.\nGemini 3 Pro preview or Gemini 3 Pro.\nGemini 3 Pro preview or Gemini 3 Pro. That's it. Make sense? So only this\nThat's it. Make sense? So only this\nThat's it. Make sense? So only this thing is these two lines are different.\nthing is these two lines are different.\nthing is these two lines are different. Everything else is exactly the same.\nEverything else is exactly the same.\nEverything else is exactly the same. Simple. So now I want to run this model,\nSimple. So now I want to run this model,\nSimple. So now I want to run this model, right? I want to just use this LLM to\nright? I want to just use this LLM to\nright? I want to just use this LLM to build my langraph application. But I\nbuild my langraph application. But I\nbuild my langraph application. But I cannot use it directly. Why? Because I\ncannot use it directly. Why? Because I\ncannot use it directly. Why? Because I would need the API key to make the API\nwould need the API key to make the API\nwould need the API key to make the API calls. Now you will say Anlamba you have\ncalls. Now you will say Anlamba you have\ncalls. Now you will say Anlamba you have this here right? Yes but I didn't load\nthis here right? Yes but I didn't load\nthis here right? Yes but I didn't load this thing right. So I first need to\nthis thing right. So I first need to\nthis thing right. So I first need to load this API key. There are multiple\nload this API key. There are multiple\nload this API key. There are multiple methods. The best method is using a load\nmethods. The best method is using a load\nmethods. The best method is using a load env method\nenv method\nenv method simple load env method. So in load env\nsimple load env method. So in load env\nsimple load env method. So in load env method you simply need to load the you\nmethod you simply need to load the you\nmethod you simply need to load the you can say your env file. So what it will\ncan say your env file. So what it will\ncan say your env file. So what it will do under the hood, it will create the\ndo under the hood, it will create the\ndo under the hood, it will create the environment variable\nenvironment variable\nenvironment variable on the top of all the variables that you\non the top of all the variables that you\non the top of all the variables that you have defined in your DNV file.\nhave defined in your DNV file.\nhave defined in your DNV file. Simple, simple, simple, simple. Let me\nSimple, simple, simple, simple. Let me\nSimple, simple, simple, simple. Let me just show you how you can just do that.\njust show you how you can just do that.\njust show you how you can just do that. So simply go to terminal and download or\nSo simply go to terminal and download or\nSo simply go to terminal and download or add uvad.\nadd uvad.\nadd uvad. I guess uh I think it was already added\nI guess uh I think it was already added\nI guess uh I think it was already added when we just loaded that thing. So here\nwhen we just loaded that thing. So here\nwhen we just loaded that thing. So here I can write\nI can write\nI can write from\nfrom\nfrom um env import load env. So this is the\num env import load env. So this is the\num env import load env. So this is the package name and then I need to run the\npackage name and then I need to run the\npackage name and then I need to run the function called load env. Simple and let\nfunction called load env. Simple and let\nfunction called load env. Simple and let me just run this code in the new cell\nme just run this code in the new cell\nme just run this code in the new cell because I want to show you a very small\nbecause I want to show you a very small\nbecause I want to show you a very small step. So I will run it here\nstep. So I will run it here\nstep. So I will run it here and it will just prompt you to install\nand it will just prompt you to install\nand it will just prompt you to install this thing. Simply click on install. It\nthis thing. Simply click on install. It\nthis thing. Simply click on install. It will install the IPI kernel. So now this\nwill install the IPI kernel. So now this\nwill install the IPI kernel. So now this code will be running. Now what will\ncode will be running. Now what will\ncode will be running. Now what will happen? Whatever variables I have\nhappen? Whatever variables I have\nhappen? Whatever variables I have written in my env file will be\nwritten in my env file will be\nwritten in my env file will be automatically loaded in my environment.\nautomatically loaded in my environment.\nautomatically loaded in my environment. You want to confirm. Let me just show\nYou want to confirm. Let me just show\nYou want to confirm. Let me just show you. If I write import OS simple and I\nyou. If I write import OS simple and I\nyou. If I write import OS simple and I want to confirm that if OS.inviron\nwant to confirm that if OS.inviron\nwant to confirm that if OS.inviron environ\nenviron\nenviron and environ name is open API key. Okay,\nand environ name is open API key. Okay,\nand environ name is open API key. Okay, if this exists simply say\nif this exists simply say\nif this exists simply say open AI key is set otherwise\nyou can raise the error as well. Raise\nyou can raise the error as well. Raise exception error value error whatever\nexception error value error whatever\nexception error value error whatever let's try to run it. What did I get?\nlet's try to run it. What did I get?\nlet's try to run it. What did I get? Open AI key is set. Simple. If you get\nOpen AI key is set. Simple. If you get\nOpen AI key is set. Simple. If you get this only then you need to proceed\nthis only then you need to proceed\nthis only then you need to proceed otherwise you should not proceed. Why?\notherwise you should not proceed. Why?\notherwise you should not proceed. Why? because um you first need to have your\nbecause um you first need to have your\nbecause um you first need to have your open API key set. If you do not see this\nopen API key set. If you do not see this\nopen API key set. If you do not see this error then maybe you have not created\nerror then maybe you have not created\nerror then maybe you have not created this file or maybe you have not saved it\nthis file or maybe you have not saved it\nthis file or maybe you have not saved it with the right name or you have not\nwith the right name or you have not\nwith the right name or you have not saved this file. Maybe it is there but\nsaved this file. Maybe it is there but\nsaved this file. Maybe it is there but you forgot to save it. So just make sure\nyou forgot to save it. So just make sure\nyou forgot to save it. So just make sure that it is saved as well. Simple. Now\nthat it is saved as well. Simple. Now\nthat it is saved as well. Simple. Now you're good to go. Let me now just\nyou're good to go. Let me now just\nyou're good to go. Let me now just transfer this code here.\ntransfer this code here.\ntransfer this code here. And perfect.\nSo these are the sections for our\nSo these are the sections for our libraries. So we will be just reusing\nlibraries. So we will be just reusing\nlibraries. So we will be just reusing this particular area to import the\nthis particular area to import the\nthis particular area to import the packages. Simple. So I'll just reusing\npackages. Simple. So I'll just reusing\npackages. Simple. So I'll just reusing this thing. Okay, makes sense. So this\nthis thing. Okay, makes sense. So this\nthis thing. Okay, makes sense. So this is my libraries that I'm just importing.\nis my libraries that I'm just importing.\nis my libraries that I'm just importing. And now I will create the llm here in\nAnd now I will create the llm here in\nAnd now I will create the llm here in this cell. So I will write llm\nthis cell. So I will write llm\nthis cell. So I will write llm equals to chad openi. Let me just write\nequals to chad openi. Let me just write\nequals to chad openi. Let me just write it here.\nit here.\nit here. Good.\nSo this is my object. It is saying chat\nSo this is my object. It is saying chat open is not defined obviously because we\nopen is not defined obviously because we\nopen is not defined obviously because we didn't run this cell. So let me just run\ndidn't run this cell. So let me just run\ndidn't run this cell. So let me just run this cell one more time. So now it will\nthis cell one more time. So now it will\nthis cell one more time. So now it will simply import everything. Now let's run\nsimply import everything. Now let's run\nsimply import everything. Now let's run this.\nthis.\nthis. So this is my LLM object that I have\nSo this is my LLM object that I have\nSo this is my LLM object that I have created. Now this LLM object is created.\ncreated. Now this LLM object is created.\ncreated. Now this LLM object is created. That means now I can use this LLM to\nThat means now I can use this LLM to\nThat means now I can use this LLM to make the API calls to the model called\nmake the API calls to the model called\nmake the API calls to the model called GPT5 nano. The same way I ask the\nGPT5 nano. The same way I ask the\nGPT5 nano. The same way I ask the questions from chat GPD. Now I can do do\nquestions from chat GPD. Now I can do do\nquestions from chat GPD. Now I can do do the same stuff with the LLM object as\nthe same stuff with the LLM object as\nthe same stuff with the LLM object as well. Let me just show you. Let's say I\nwell. Let me just show you. Let's say I\nwell. Let me just show you. Let's say I want to ask one questions question. So\nwant to ask one questions question. So\nwant to ask one questions question. So let's say I will say LLM and there's a\nlet's say I will say LLM and there's a\nlet's say I will say LLM and there's a dot invoke method in the lang chain.\ndot invoke method in the lang chain.\ndot invoke method in the lang chain. Langchain langraph both. So whenever I'm\nLangchain langraph both. So whenever I'm\nLangchain langraph both. So whenever I'm saying lang chain I'm referring to lang\nsaying lang chain I'm referring to lang\nsaying lang chain I'm referring to lang graph. When I whenever I'm just saying\ngraph. When I whenever I'm just saying\ngraph. When I whenever I'm just saying lang graph I'm just referring to lang\nlang graph I'm just referring to lang\nlang graph I'm just referring to lang graph simple\ngraph simple\ngraph simple because both are connected. So I will\nbecause both are connected. So I will\nbecause both are connected. So I will say\nsay\nsay I want to know the meaning of this would\nI want to know the meaning of this would\nI want to know the meaning of this would be a very high level question. So let's\nbe a very high level question. So let's\nbe a very high level question. So let's say meaning of water.\nsay meaning of water.\nsay meaning of water. Water. Okay. So let's say I want to know\nWater. Okay. So let's say I want to know\nWater. Okay. So let's say I want to know the meaning of water. Simple. And I want\nthe meaning of water. Simple. And I want\nthe meaning of water. Simple. And I want to ask this question. So I will wrap my\nto ask this question. So I will wrap my\nto ask this question.

So now let's wait and let's see what\nSo now let's wait and let's see what\nSo now let's wait and let's see what answer do we get. It will take some time\nanswer do we get. It will take some time\nanswer do we get. It will take some time obviously to throw some answer because\nobviously to throw some answer because\nobviously to throw some answer because it will fetch the answer then it will\nit will fetch the answer then it will\nit will fetch the answer then it will just show you. So I have just got\njust show you. So I have just got\njust show you. So I have just got something AI message content equals to\nsomething AI message content equals to\nsomething AI message content equals to here are a few ways to understand water.\nhere are a few ways to understand water.\nhere are a few ways to understand water. I think this was a difficult question\nI think this was a difficult question\nI think this was a difficult question for LM as well. Scientific meaning. Wow.\nfor LM as well. Scientific meaning. Wow.\nfor LM as well. Scientific meaning. Wow. Water is a chemical substance with the\nWater is a chemical substance with the\nWater is a chemical substance with the formula H2O. Two hydrogen atoms bounded\nformula H2O. Two hydrogen atoms bounded\nformula H2O. Two hydrogen atoms bounded to one oxygen atom. Wow. It exists in\nto one oxygen atom. Wow. It exists in\nto one oxygen atom. Wow. It exists in three forms, solid, liquid, gas and\nthree forms, solid, liquid, gas and\nthree forms, solid, liquid, gas and whatever. So this is the answer that I\nwhatever. So this is the answer that I\nwhatever. So this is the answer that I have got from LLM from AI kind of AI\nhave got from LLM from AI kind of AI\nhave got from LLM from AI kind of AI right? LM is also a kind of AI\nright? LM is also a kind of AI\nright? LM is also a kind of AI um deep learning model transformer\num deep learning model transformer\num deep learning model transformer model. Okay. So that's how I can just\nmodel. Okay. So that's how I can just\nmodel. Okay. So that's how I can just ask the question. But you know what? I\nask the question. But you know what? I\nask the question. But you know what? I can only get the answer for the question\ncan only get the answer for the question\ncan only get the answer for the question that it can answer. So if I will ask the\nthat it can answer. So if I will ask the\nthat it can answer. So if I will ask the same question that I asked to charge GPD\nsame question that I asked to charge GPD\nsame question that I asked to charge GPD few minutes back,\nfew minutes back,\nfew minutes back, what's the temperature in let's say LA?\nwhat's the temperature in let's say LA?\nwhat's the temperature in let's say LA? Okay, let me just run this. It will not\nOkay, let me just run this. It will not\nOkay, let me just run this. It will not tell me. Why? Because it doesn't have\ntell me. Why? Because it doesn't have\ntell me. Why? Because it doesn't have access to network APIs. Nothing. It is\naccess to network APIs. Nothing. It is\naccess to network APIs. Nothing. It is just an LLM. Pure LLM. Do you mean Los\njust an LLM. Pure LLM. Do you mean Los\njust an LLM. Pure LLM. Do you mean Los Angeles? Yeah, I meant Los Angeles.\nAngeles? Yeah, I meant Los Angeles.\nAngeles? Yeah, I meant Los Angeles. Oh, so it is saying finally I don't have\nOh, so it is saying finally I don't have\nOh, so it is saying finally I don't have realtime weather metadata here unless\nrealtime weather metadata here unless\nrealtime weather metadata here unless your platform support\nyour platform support\nyour platform support this thing. So it is specifically\nthis thing. So it is specifically\nthis thing. So it is specifically mentioning that first of all it is\nmentioning that first of all it is\nmentioning that first of all it is confirming like LA means what? Okay. And\nconfirming like LA means what? Okay. And\nconfirming like LA means what? Okay. And second it is asking like me to provide\nsecond it is asking like me to provide\nsecond it is asking like me to provide some kind of clarity about the platform\nsome kind of clarity about the platform\nsome kind of clarity about the platform because my platform doesn't have the\nbecause my platform doesn't have the\nbecause my platform doesn't have the support with current APIs for weather.\nsupport with current APIs for weather.\nsupport with current APIs for weather. Simple. So when that thing happens then\nSimple. So when that thing happens then\nSimple. So when that thing happens then you need to make sure that your LLM is\nyou need to make sure that your LLM is\nyou need to make sure that your LLM is equipped with tools and you'll be just\nequipped with tools and you'll be just\nequipped with tools and you'll be just working with that thing. Don't worry at\nworking with that thing. Don't worry at\nworking with that thing. Don't worry at all. But for now we do not have any\nall. But for now we do not have any\nall. But for now we do not have any tools and all. Okay. But we can just use\ntools and all. Okay. But we can just use\ntools and all. Okay. But we can just use LLM to make the um question calls that\nLLM to make the um question calls that\nLLM to make the um question calls that it can answer simple because LLM can\nit can answer simple because LLM can\nit can answer simple because LLM can perform so many things other than just\nperform so many things other than just\nperform so many things other than just making the API calls. So it can actually\nmaking the API calls. So it can actually\nmaking the API calls. So it can actually answer so many things and it can work on\nanswer so many things and it can work on\nanswer so many things and it can work on the responses as well. So we are good\nthe responses as well. So we are good\nthe responses as well. So we are good with that. So let's say our this\nwith that. So let's say our this\nwith that. So let's say our this question is good and I can just make the\nquestion is good and I can just make the\nquestion is good and I can just make the API calls and as you can see we are just\nAPI calls and as you can see we are just\nAPI calls and as you can see we are just simply making API calls. Obviously it is\nsimply making API calls. Obviously it is\nsimply making API calls. Obviously it is using my amount which is stored in the\nusing my amount which is stored in the\nusing my amount which is stored in the open AI account. Simple. Okay. So this\nopen AI account. Simple. Okay. So this\nopen AI account. Simple. Okay. So this is a very basic node that we have\nis a very basic node that we have\nis a very basic node that we have created. Simple. So now what I will do I\ncreated. Simple. So now what I will do I\ncreated. Simple. So now what I will do I will just show you and just remember\nwill just show you and just remember\nwill just show you and just remember this thing. Okay. So this is basically a\nthis thing. Okay. So this is basically a\nthis thing. Okay. So this is basically a kind of boilerplate code that we will be\nkind of boilerplate code that we will be\nkind of boilerplate code that we will be just reusing in every notebook like\njust reusing in every notebook like\njust reusing in every notebook like first of all importing the libraries and\nfirst of all importing the libraries and\nfirst of all importing the libraries and then making the API call. Simple. So now\nthen making the API call. Simple. So now\nthen making the API call. Simple. So now I want to show you how you can just\nI want to show you how you can just\nI want to show you how you can just create your basic and very first lang\ncreate your basic and very first lang\ncreate your basic and very first lang graph. Lang graph means graph. It is a\ngraph. Lang graph means graph. It is a\ngraph. Lang graph means graph. It is a kind of graph. Graph means nodes and\nkind of graph. Graph means nodes and\nkind of graph. Graph means nodes and edges. Same like here if I go here. So\nedges. Same like here if I go here. So\nedges. Same like here if I go here. So this is a graph right this is a graph\nthis is a graph right this is a graph\nthis is a graph right this is a graph where you have nodes edges everything.\nwhere you have nodes edges everything.\nwhere you have nodes edges everything. So I will just show you how you can just\nSo I will just show you how you can just\nSo I will just show you how you can just create your very first graph. Simple and\ncreate your very first graph. Simple and\ncreate your very first graph. Simple and let me just show you how your first\nlet me just show you how your first\nlet me just show you how your first graph will look like.\nSo let's say first\nSo let's say first graph simple first graph. So here the\ngraph simple first graph. So here the\ngraph simple first graph. So here the requirement is very simple. Let me first\nrequirement is very simple. Let me first\nrequirement is very simple. Let me first of all explain you will create your very\nof all explain you will create your very\nof all explain you will create your very first graph and the requirement is you\nfirst graph and the requirement is you\nfirst graph and the requirement is you are a developer. Okay developer of the\nare a developer. Okay developer of the\nare a developer. Okay developer of the graph and obviously user as well both.\ngraph and obviously user as well both.\ngraph and obviously user as well both. So you need to create your very first\nSo you need to create your very first\nSo you need to create your very first graph. So it will it should be like very\ngraph. So it will it should be like very\ngraph. So it will it should be like very very simple a kind of greeting message.\nvery simple a kind of greeting message.\nvery simple a kind of greeting message. That's it. That's how you learn and\nThat's it. That's how you learn and\nThat's it. That's how you learn and grow. Okay. So now greeting yeah very\ngrow. Okay. So now greeting yeah very\ngrow. Okay. So now greeting yeah very first is like greeting simply like just\nfirst is like greeting simply like just\nfirst is like greeting simply like just one node and that's it simple very first\none node and that's it simple very first\none node and that's it simple very first node so because that's how you will\nnode so because that's how you will\nnode so because that's how you will learn like okay how we can just create\nlearn like okay how we can just create\nlearn like okay how we can just create these nodes simple so how you will just\nthese nodes simple so how you will just\nthese nodes simple so how you will just create this graph let me just show you\ncreate this graph let me just show you\ncreate this graph let me just show you so let me just grab that particular code\nso let me just grab that particular code\nso let me just grab that particular code for it and it will look like this so let\nfor it and it will look like this so let\nfor it and it will look like this so let me just go to mermaid to excal yeah so\nme just go to mermaid to excal yeah so\nme just go to mermaid to excal yeah so here let me just write the code for it.\nhere let me just write the code for it.\nhere let me just write the code for it. Insert. So this is your tag or basically\nInsert. So this is your tag or basically\nInsert. So this is your tag or basically graph. Simple. You can just draw it\ngraph. Simple. You can just draw it\ngraph. Simple. You can just draw it here as well or you can just use the\nhere as well or you can just use the\nhere as well or you can just use the mermaid\nmermaid\nmermaid website as well. Let me just show you\nwebsite as well. Let me just show you\nwebsite as well. Let me just show you that as well. Mermaid\nthat as well. Mermaid\nthat as well. Mermaid live editor. So here I will just write\nlive editor. So here I will just write\nlive editor. So here I will just write the code from where that code um\nthe code from where that code um\nthe code from where that code um appeared. Do not worry at I will just\nappeared. Do not worry at I will just\nappeared. Do not worry at I will just show you that is just just just a way to\nshow you that is just just just a way to\nshow you that is just just just a way to just create or display the graph. Okay,\njust create or display the graph. Okay,\njust create or display the graph. Okay, for now you do not need to worry at all.\nfor now you do not need to worry at all.\nfor now you do not need to worry at all. This is just a kind of visual way and\nThis is just a kind of visual way and\nThis is just a kind of visual way and I'll be just using this particular\nI'll be just using this particular\nI'll be just using this particular website to create or visualize that\nwebsite to create or visualize that\nwebsite to create or visualize that thing. Simple. But for this example, I'm\nthing. Simple. But for this example, I'm\nthing. Simple. But for this example, I'm just using my native um library.\njust using my native um library.\njust using my native um library. Perfect. So you need to create this\nPerfect. So you need to create this\nPerfect. So you need to create this graph where you will start the graph,\ngraph where you will start the graph,\ngraph where you will start the graph, you will greet it and you will end it.\nyou will greet it and you will end it.\nyou will greet it and you will end it. Simple. This is your task. You need to\nSimple. This is your task. You need to\nSimple. This is your task. You need to create this graph. Simple. Let's draw\ncreate this graph. Simple. Let's draw\ncreate this graph. Simple. Let's draw it. Let's draw it together. And not just\nit. Let's draw it together. And not just\nit. Let's draw it together. And not just draw, let's craft it together. So, first\ndraw, let's craft it together. So, first\ndraw, let's craft it together. So, first thing first,\nthing first,\nthing first, you need to get started with it using a\nyou need to get started with it using a\nyou need to get started with it using a kind of schema.\nkind of schema.\nkind of schema. The first thing in graph that you should\nThe first thing in graph that you should\nThe first thing in graph that you should have in your mind should be schema\nhave in your mind should be schema\nhave in your mind should be schema like what exactly you need to travel\nlike what exactly you need to travel\nlike what exactly you need to travel from one node to another.\nfrom one node to another.\nfrom one node to another. Okay. The step one should be define the\nOkay. The step one should be define the\nOkay. The step one should be define the schema. Now in langraph\nwe have a very good name or you can say\nwe have a very good name or you can say in the AI era we have a very good name\nin the AI era we have a very good name\nin the AI era we have a very good name uh of schema or second name of schema is\nuh of schema or second name of schema is\nuh of schema or second name of schema is called state. It's called state. State\ncalled state. It's called state. State\ncalled state. It's called state. State of your graph simple. So let me just\nof your graph simple. So let me just\nof your graph simple. So let me just write the heading\nuh first\nuh first graph simple first graph and let me just\ngraph simple first graph and let me just\ngraph simple first graph and let me just write it here\nwrite it here\nwrite it here markdown let's say step one\nstep one is\nstep one is define the\ndefine the\ndefine the schema. Simple. This is the very first\nschema. Simple. This is the very first\nschema. Simple. This is the very first step. Define the schema. You need to\nstep. Define the schema. You need to\nstep. Define the schema. You need to define the schema of your node. And do\ndefine the schema of your node. And do\ndefine the schema of your node. And do you know what? Schema should not be\nyou know what? Schema should not be\nyou know what? Schema should not be changed. And schema\nchanged. And schema\nchanged. And schema can be changed but should not be\ncan be changed but should not be\ncan be changed but should not be changed. This is your something that you\nchanged. This is your something that you\nchanged. This is your something that you should have in your mind.\nshould have in your mind.\nshould have in your mind. Simple. You define the schema first and\nSimple. You define the schema first and\nSimple. You define the schema first and then you build your graph.\nthen you build your graph.\nthen you build your graph. Simple. Let's say in my case I want to\nSimple. Let's say in my case I want to\nSimple. Let's say in my case I want to define a schema where I want columns or\ndefine a schema where I want columns or\ndefine a schema where I want columns or keys such as name and message. These two\nkeys such as name and message. These two\nkeys such as name and message. These two things name and message simple.\nthings name and message simple.\nthings name and message simple. And\nAnd\nAnd you can define a schema using two\nyou can define a schema using two\nyou can define a schema using two things. The first is lightweight schema.\nthings. The first is lightweight schema.\nthings. The first is lightweight schema. The second is heavyweight schema.\nThe second is heavyweight schema.\nThe second is heavyweight schema. Heavyweight schema is like with strict\nHeavyweight schema is like with strict\nHeavyweight schema is like with strict rules. The lightweight schema is like\nrules. The lightweight schema is like\nrules. The lightweight schema is like without strict rules. So we will just\nwithout strict rules. So we will just\nwithout strict rules. So we will just continue with lightweight schema. And we\ncontinue with lightweight schema. And we\ncontinue with lightweight schema. And we always work with lightweight schema. We\nalways work with lightweight schema. We\nalways work with lightweight schema. We use heavyweight schema when we want to\nuse heavyweight schema when we want to\nuse heavyweight schema when we want to build very strict rules. But it's fine.\nbuild very strict rules. But it's fine.\nbuild very strict rules. But it's fine. I will just show you that as well later\nI will just show you that as well later\nI will just show you that as well later on. But currently we are simply building\non. But currently we are simply building\non. But currently we are simply building lightweight schema. So if you want to\nlightweight schema. So if you want to\nlightweight schema. So if you want to build a lightweight schema, we will use\nbuild a lightweight schema, we will use\nbuild a lightweight schema, we will use a package called typing. And I will\na package called typing. And I will\na package called typing. And I will import typed dect.\nimport typed dect.\nimport typed dect. simple I can import list as well. So\nsimple I can import list as well. So\nsimple I can import list as well. So this is a kind of library in Python that\nthis is a kind of library in Python that\nthis is a kind of library in Python that we use. So here I will create a class\nwe use. So here I will create a class\nwe use. So here I will create a class which class I will call it as let's say\nwhich class I will call it as let's say\nwhich class I will call it as let's say schema or you can say graph schema\nschema or you can say graph schema\nschema or you can say graph schema simple graph schema and while defining\nsimple graph schema and while defining\nsimple graph schema and while defining this class I need to inherit\nthis class I need to inherit\nthis class I need to inherit type deck simple so that I can just\ntype deck simple so that I can just\ntype deck simple so that I can just create all of the columns with ease. So\ncreate all of the columns with ease. So\ncreate all of the columns with ease. So I want just two two keys. First of all,\nI want just two two keys. First of all,\nI want just two two keys. First of all, name\nname\nname and this will be of string type simple.\nand this will be of string type simple.\nand this will be of string type simple. I want greet or let's say not greet.\nI want greet or let's say not greet.\nI want greet or let's say not greet. Let's say welcome.\nLet's say welcome.\nLet's say welcome. Let's say welcome. Anything okay? Or\nLet's say welcome. Anything okay? Or\nLet's say welcome. Anything okay? Or let's say message.\nlet's say message.\nlet's say message. Okay. Message. And this will be of\nOkay. Message. And this will be of\nOkay. Message. And this will be of string type as well. Simple. This is my\nstring type as well. Simple. This is my\nstring type as well. Simple. This is my schema.\nschema.\nschema. This is my schema. Perfect. My schema is\nThis is my schema. Perfect. My schema is\nThis is my schema. Perfect. My schema is ready. Now I know that my graph will be\nready. Now I know that my graph will be\nready. Now I know that my graph will be just carrying this particular thing.\njust carrying this particular thing.\njust carrying this particular thing. Right? Now the step two is very easy.\nRight? Now the step two is very easy.\nRight? Now the step two is very easy. Now you need to build the node\nNow you need to build the node\nNow you need to build the node node. But when I say you need to build\nnode. But when I say you need to build\nnode. But when I say you need to build the node, you need to build the\nthe node, you need to build the\nthe node, you need to build the functions of nodes like what exactly you\nfunctions of nodes like what exactly you\nfunctions of nodes like what exactly you need to execute within the node. So I\nneed to execute within the node. So I\nneed to execute within the node. So I will say\nOkay node functions. So in my case I\nOkay node functions. So in my case I just have single node. So very simple\njust have single node. So very simple\njust have single node. So very simple question. How many functions will I\nquestion. How many functions will I\nquestion. How many functions will I have? Only one obviously only one right.\nhave? Only one obviously only one right.\nhave? Only one obviously only one right. So I will simply say\nSo I will simply say\nSo I will simply say def very simple Python function and I\ndef very simple Python function and I\ndef very simple Python function and I will say welcome this node name is\nwill say welcome this node name is\nwill say welcome this node name is welcome simple now it's very important\nwelcome simple now it's very important\nwelcome simple now it's very important and by the way let me just nose it is\nand by the way let me just nose it is\nand by the way let me just nose it is just keep on writing my code and\njust keep on writing my code and\njust keep on writing my code and is not letting me write any code bro\nis not letting me write any code bro\nis not letting me write any code bro you're making me lazy\nyou're making me lazy\nyou're making me lazy so it's actually very good when you're\nso it's actually very good when you're\nso it's actually very good when you're just developing something I want to\njust developing something I want to\njust developing something I want to explain you and I do not want you to be\nexplain you and I do not want you to be\nexplain you and I do not want you to be like um distracted by looking at the\nlike um distracted by looking at the\nlike um distracted by looking at the code. So that is why I have just turned\ncode. So that is why I have just turned\ncode. So that is why I have just turned it off. By the way, it's very good. You\nit off. By the way, it's very good. You\nit off. By the way, it's very good. You should use it. And yeah, let's talk\nshould use it. And yeah, let's talk\nshould use it. And yeah, let's talk about this function. So basically now\nabout this function. So basically now\nabout this function. So basically now this is the you can say very important\nthis is the you can say very important\nthis is the you can say very important concept of the entire graph thing. Now\nconcept of the entire graph thing. Now\nconcept of the entire graph thing. Now you will be creating nodes. Yes. Now in\nyou will be creating nodes. Yes. Now in\nyou will be creating nodes. Yes. Now in every node function basically node\nevery node function basically node\nevery node function basically node function you have to use something\nfunction you have to use something\nfunction you have to use something called as schema\ncalled as schema\ncalled as schema and this is the backbone of stateful\nand this is the backbone of stateful\nand this is the backbone of stateful orchestration. Now what will I do? I\norchestration. Now what will I do? I\norchestration. Now what will I do? I will create this function and I will use\nwill create this function and I will use\nwill create this function and I will use a and you can say a variable let's say\na and you can say a variable let's say\na and you can say a variable let's say schema.\nschema.\nschema. Let's say schema. Okay. Because I am a\nLet's say schema. Okay. Because I am a\nLet's say schema. Okay. Because I am a data engineer. I am an AI data engineer.\ndata engineer. I am an AI data engineer.\ndata engineer. I am an AI data engineer. So I like to use schema word but you can\nSo I like to use schema word but you can\nSo I like to use schema word but you can also use state. Okay. So let's try to\nalso use state. Okay. So let's try to\nalso use state. Okay. So let's try to use state. Simple. Now this is state\nuse state. Simple. Now this is state\nuse state. Simple. Now this is state variable which will be available to each\nvariable which will be available to each\nvariable which will be available to each function automatically by default by\nfunction automatically by default by\nfunction automatically by default by default because that is the langraph\ndefault because that is the langraph\ndefault because that is the langraph framework designed. That's how like\nframework designed. That's how like\nframework designed. That's how like langraph framework is designed. And this\nlangraph framework is designed. And this\nlangraph framework is designed. And this state variable will have the data type\nstate variable will have the data type\nstate variable will have the data type that you have defined here. Graph\nthat you have defined here. Graph\nthat you have defined here. Graph schema. That means it will have name and\nschema. That means it will have name and\nschema. That means it will have name and message. Wow. Yes. So you can say this\nmessage. Wow. Yes. So you can say this\nmessage. Wow. Yes. So you can say this data type of this particular variable is\ndata type of this particular variable is\ndata type of this particular variable is graph schema. Simple. And what it\ngraph schema. Simple. And what it\ngraph schema. Simple. And what it returns? It returns the graph schema\nreturns? It returns the graph schema\nreturns? It returns the graph schema data type because that what we should\ndata type because that what we should\ndata type because that what we should return every time. Simple makes sense.\nreturn every time. Simple makes sense.\nreturn every time. Simple makes sense. So this is the very first step. So I\nSo this is the very first step. So I\nSo this is the very first step. So I have defined my function df. Simple.\nhave defined my function df. Simple.\nhave defined my function df. Simple. Okay. Now I will let me start. Now I\nOkay. Now I will let me start. Now I\nOkay. Now I will let me start. Now I will use this particular variable state.\nwill use this particular variable state.\nwill use this particular variable state. Now we know that the state is a kind of\nNow we know that the state is a kind of\nNow we know that the state is a kind of dictionary, right? Typic is a\ndictionary, right? Typic is a\ndictionary, right? Typic is a dictionary. It will convert this\ndictionary. It will convert this\ndictionary. It will convert this particular object into a dictionary.\nparticular object into a dictionary.\nparticular object into a dictionary. Simple. So now I want to fetch name and\nSimple. So now I want to fetch name and\nSimple. So now I want to fetch name and message from the state from the current\nmessage from the state from the current\nmessage from the state from the current state. Right? So I can write let's say\nstate. Right? So I can write let's say\nstate. Right? So I can write let's say current name equals state of name\ncurrent name equals state of name\ncurrent name equals state of name current message\ncurrent message\ncurrent message equals to state of message. Simple\nequals to state of message. Simple\nequals to state of message. Simple current name current message. Simple. So\ncurrent name current message. Simple. So\ncurrent name current message. Simple. So I have simply fetched the information.\nI have simply fetched the information.\nI have simply fetched the information. Now do you know what will I do? I will\nNow do you know what will I do? I will\nNow do you know what will I do? I will simply make an API call.\nsimply make an API call.\nsimply make an API call. How?\nHow?\nHow? By using llm I will simply say\nBy using llm I will simply say\nBy using llm I will simply say response\nresponse\nresponse equals llm dot\nequals llm dot\nequals llm dot invoke right now I need to just pass the\ninvoke right now I need to just pass the\ninvoke right now I need to just pass the message so I will write like this using\nmessage so I will write like this using\nmessage so I will write like this using f string my name is and what is my name\nf string my name is and what is my name\nf string my name is and what is my name current name\ncurrent name\ncurrent name simple\nsimple\nsimple simple and then I will pass the message\nsimple and then I will pass the message\nsimple and then I will pass the message exactly as it\ncurrent message. Now response in the\ncurrent message. Now response in the response I get everything as you know\nresponse I get everything as you know\nresponse I get everything as you know see chat openai profile and whatever if\nsee chat openai profile and whatever if\nsee chat openai profile and whatever if I let's say run this again just to show\nI let's say run this again just to show\nI let's say run this again just to show you\nyou\nyou so I get everything like AI message then\nso I get everything like AI message then\nso I get everything like AI message then content and everything if I want to just\ncontent and everything if I want to just\ncontent and everything if I want to just fetch the response or basically the\nfetch the response or basically the\nfetch the response or basically the content this this content only because\ncontent this this content only because\ncontent this this content only because in the response I have so many things\nin the response I have so many things\nin the response I have so many things regarding tokens and all so many things\nregarding tokens and all so many things\nregarding tokens and all so many things like metadata I don't want this thing I\nlike metadata I don't want this thing I\nlike metadata I don't want this thing I just want the content I can\njust want the content I can\njust want the content I can dot content then I will only see the\ndot content then I will only see the\ndot content then I will only see the text message right that's how we fetch\ntext message right that's how we fetch\ntext message right that's how we fetch the information fundamentals of Python\nthe information fundamentals of Python\nthe information fundamentals of Python that's why we say fundamentals are\nthat's why we say fundamentals are\nthat's why we say fundamentals are important but nowadays no one wants to\nimportant but nowadays no one wants to\nimportant but nowadays no one wants to learn the fundamentals everyone wants to\nlearn the fundamentals everyone wants to\nlearn the fundamentals everyone wants to directly jump onto the langraph lang\ndirectly jump onto the langraph lang\ndirectly jump onto the langraph lang chain cover your fundamentals first of\nchain cover your fundamentals first of\nchain cover your fundamentals first of all broke so I will simply say dot\nall broke so I will simply say dot\nall broke so I will simply say dot content\nsimple this is my response now what will\nsimple this is my response now what will I do you know But I will change the\nI do you know But I will change the\nI do you know But I will change the message. Wow. This message was initially\nmessage. Wow. This message was initially\nmessage. Wow. This message was initially something else. That was my message,\nsomething else. That was my message,\nsomething else. That was my message, user's message. But I will change it to\nuser's message. But I will change it to\nuser's message. But I will change it to AI message. I can do that. I can do\nAI message. I can do that. I can do\nAI message. I can do that. I can do that. How? I will simply say\nthat. How? I will simply say\nthat. How? I will simply say state of message\nstate of message\nstate of message equals\nequals\nequals response. Simple. Simple.\nresponse. Simple. Simple.\nresponse. Simple. Simple. And I can simply return state.\nAnd I can simply return state.\nAnd I can simply return state. Simple.\nSimple.\nSimple. Wow.\nWow.\nWow. Wow.\nWow.\nWow. This is amazing. And just to like make\nThis is amazing. And just to like make\nThis is amazing. And just to like make it more beautiful, I can simply say so\nit more beautiful, I can simply say so\nit more beautiful, I can simply say so that you will also see the change in the\nthat you will also see the change in the\nthat you will also see the change in the real time. I will say um\nreal time. I will say um\nreal time. I will say um you let's say I can also use plus. Yeah.\nyou let's say I can also use plus. Yeah.\nyou let's say I can also use plus. Yeah. Yeah. Let's use plus. So I will say your\nYeah. Let's use plus. So I will say your\nYeah. Let's use plus. So I will say your message was\nmessage was\nmessage was okay your message was current message\nokay your message was current message\nokay your message was current message let's use f\nlet's use f\nlet's use f your message was current message\nhere is my\nhere is my response and then I will just write the\nresponse and then I will just write the\nresponse and then I will just write the response simple so this is a current\nresponse simple so this is a current\nresponse simple so this is a current state that means I have changed the\nstate that means I have changed the\nstate that means I have changed the state of this message to this updated\nstate of this message to this updated\nstate of this message to this updated message. Wow. And now I'm returning this\nmessage. Wow. And now I'm returning this\nmessage. Wow. And now I'm returning this state that means the entire dictionary.\nstate that means the entire dictionary.\nstate that means the entire dictionary. Did I change name? No. So name will be\nDid I change name? No. So name will be\nDid I change name? No. So name will be as it is.\nas it is.\nas it is. Name will be as it is. And now very\nName will be as it is. And now very\nName will be as it is. And now very important concept. Whenever you write\nimportant concept. Whenever you write\nimportant concept. Whenever you write something here state message equals to\nsomething here state message equals to\nsomething here state message equals to this thing, it will automatically update\nthis thing, it will automatically update\nthis thing, it will automatically update the value with this latest message.\nthe value with this latest message.\nthe value with this latest message. That is again the fundamental. That\nThat is again the fundamental. That\nThat is again the fundamental. That means you can make the in place changes\nmeans you can make the in place changes\nmeans you can make the in place changes in the dictionary. Right? Have you\nin the dictionary. Right? Have you\nin the dictionary. Right? Have you studied about pointers in Python or in\nstudied about pointers in Python or in\nstudied about pointers in Python or in any programming language? No. Fine. So\nany programming language? No. Fine. So\nany programming language? No. Fine. So what will happen if you have a\nwhat will happen if you have a\nwhat will happen if you have a dictionary, right? Let me show you. If\ndictionary, right? Let me show you. If\ndictionary, right? Let me show you. If you have a dictionary like this, let's\nyou have a dictionary like this, let's\nyou have a dictionary like this, let's say dictionary equals to a 10. Let's say\nsay dictionary equals to a 10. Let's say\nsay dictionary equals to a 10. Let's say the value of a is 10. Simple. And if I\nthe value of a is 10. Simple. And if I\nthe value of a is 10. Simple. And if I just print the dictionary,\njust print the dictionary,\njust print the dictionary, I will get a 10. But now if I say\nI will get a 10. But now if I say\nI will get a 10. But now if I say dict of a is equals to 100. And if I\ndict of a is equals to 100. And if I\ndict of a is equals to 100. And if I just print dictionary, it will make in\njust print dictionary, it will make in\njust print dictionary, it will make in place changes. See a equals to 100. Now\nplace changes. See a equals to 100. Now\nplace changes. See a equals to 100. Now that is called pointers like pointers\nthat is called pointers like pointers\nthat is called pointers like pointers lesson. Okay. So I just made the changes\nlesson. Okay. So I just made the changes\nlesson. Okay. So I just made the changes in the message dictionary message um key\nin the message dictionary message um key\nin the message dictionary message um key of my dictionary and I'm returning this.\nof my dictionary and I'm returning this.\nof my dictionary and I'm returning this. Perfect. This is my step two because I\nPerfect. This is my step two because I\nPerfect. This is my step two because I just have single node. Think simple. I\njust have single node. Think simple. I\njust have single node. Think simple. I just have single node that's it.\njust have single node that's it.\njust have single node that's it. Now, now if I have like just single\nNow, now if I have like just single\nNow, now if I have like just single node, so what I will do now I will\nnode, so what I will do now I will\nnode, so what I will do now I will create my state graph. Yes, we just call\ncreate my state graph. Yes, we just call\ncreate my state graph. Yes, we just call it as state graph. So I will simply say\nstep three create the state graph that\nstep three create the state graph that is a better name and that is a you can\nis a better name and that is a you can\nis a better name and that is a you can say name given in the lang graph as\nsay name given in the lang graph as\nsay name given in the lang graph as well. So create the state graph\nwell. So create the state graph\nwell. So create the state graph simple. So in order to create a state\nsimple. So in order to create a state\nsimple. So in order to create a state graph, you need to import something from\ngraph, you need to import something from\ngraph, you need to import something from langraph. You need to import from\nlangraph. You need to import from\nlangraph. You need to import from langraph. import state graph. Let me\nlangraph. import state graph. Let me\nlangraph. import state graph. Let me just check the exact dictionary package\njust check the exact dictionary package\njust check the exact dictionary package name. Um yeah, it's langraph.graph.\nname. Um yeah, it's langraph.graph.\nname. Um yeah, it's langraph.graph. Okay, import state graph.\nOkay, import state graph.\nOkay, import state graph. Simple. So you need to import\nSimple. So you need to import\nSimple. So you need to import langraph.graph\nlangraph.graph\nlangraph.graph and then you need to import state graph.\nand then you need to import state graph.\nand then you need to import state graph. Simple. Very good. Let me just run this\nSimple. Very good. Let me just run this\nSimple. Very good. Let me just run this and you will see error obviously because\nand you will see error obviously because\nand you will see error obviously because we have not imported langraph module.\nwe have not imported langraph module.\nwe have not imported langraph module. Let me just add that as well. So I will\nLet me just add that as well. So I will\nLet me just add that as well. So I will simply say UV add lang graph.\nPerfect.\nPerfect. Let me just run this. Perfect. Now you\nLet me just run this. Perfect. Now you\nLet me just run this. Perfect. Now you just also need to add start and end.\njust also need to add start and end.\njust also need to add start and end. This is very important in the graph. So\nThis is very important in the graph. So\nThis is very important in the graph. So this is my package that I need to\nthis is my package that I need to\nthis is my package that I need to import. Now I will create an instance of\nimport. Now I will create an instance of\nimport. Now I will create an instance of the graph. So I will simply say graph\nthe graph. So I will simply say graph\nthe graph. So I will simply say graph equals state graph and then I need to\nequals state graph and then I need to\nequals state graph and then I need to pass the argument as my own graph. That\npass the argument as my own graph. That\npass the argument as my own graph. That means my schema of the graph which is\nmeans my schema of the graph which is\nmeans my schema of the graph which is graph\ngraph\ngraph schema. Simple. This is my graph object.\nschema. Simple. This is my graph object.\nschema. Simple. This is my graph object. Simple. And now once I have the graph\nSimple. And now once I have the graph\nSimple. And now once I have the graph now I will add the nodes to this graph\nnow I will add the nodes to this graph\nnow I will add the nodes to this graph because currently this is empty graph.\nbecause currently this is empty graph.\nbecause currently this is empty graph. So I will say graph dot add node very\nSo I will say graph dot add node very\nSo I will say graph dot add node very first node which node\nfirst node which node\nfirst node which node welcome\nwelcome\nwelcome and this is my graph name or sorry node\nand this is my graph name or sorry node\nand this is my graph name or sorry node name in the graph. Now which function is\nname in the graph. Now which function is\nname in the graph. Now which function is associated to this particular node? The\nassociated to this particular node? The\nassociated to this particular node? The function name is welcome\nfunction name is welcome\nfunction name is welcome right here as you can see welcome. Oh\nright here as you can see welcome. Oh\nright here as you can see welcome. Oh okay. So we are simply creating the\nokay. So we are simply creating the\nokay. So we are simply creating the node. Now my node is created.\nnode. Now my node is created.\nnode. Now my node is created. Now I need edges, branches and lamb we\nNow I need edges, branches and lamb we\nNow I need edges, branches and lamb we just have single node. So what a branch?\njust have single node. So what a branch?\njust have single node. So what a branch? What is that? So even if you have single\nWhat is that? So even if you have single\nWhat is that? So even if you have single node, you always create two branches\nnode, you always create two branches\nnode, you always create two branches start and end. That tells lang graph\nstart and end. That tells lang graph\nstart and end. That tells lang graph that this is the starting point of the\nthat this is the starting point of the\nthat this is the starting point of the node and this is the ending point of the\nnode and this is the ending point of the\nnode and this is the ending point of the node or basically starting point of the\nnode or basically starting point of the\nnode or basically starting point of the graph and ending point of the graph. So\ngraph and ending point of the graph. So\ngraph and ending point of the graph. So I will say let me just add the comments\ngraph dot add node and I want to add\ngraph dot add node and I want to add basically edge from start to welcome\nbasically edge from start to welcome\nbasically edge from start to welcome basically we create edges between nodes\nbasically we create edges between nodes\nbasically we create edges between nodes so we get two nodes by default start and\nso we get two nodes by default start and\nso we get two nodes by default start and end these are basically the nodes by\nend these are basically the nodes by\nend these are basically the nodes by default nodes. So I'm saying hey create\ndefault nodes. So I'm saying hey create\ndefault nodes. So I'm saying hey create my one edge from edge create my one edge\nmy one edge from edge create my one edge\nmy one edge from edge create my one edge from start node till welcome and then\nfrom start node till welcome and then\nfrom start node till welcome and then second node from welcome to end make\nsecond node from welcome to end make\nsecond node from welcome to end make sense very common sense bro you just\nsense very common sense bro you just\nsense very common sense bro you just need to create a graph start to end\nneed to create a graph start to end\nneed to create a graph start to end simple so you will first of all say\nsimple so you will first of all say\nsimple so you will first of all say start welcome and then welcome to end\nstart welcome and then welcome to end\nstart welcome and then welcome to end graph dot add edge welcome to end so\ngraph dot add edge welcome to end so\ngraph dot add edge welcome to end so this is it my graph is ready graph is\nthis is it my graph is ready graph is\nthis is it my graph is ready graph is ready yeah kind I just need to now\nready yeah kind I just need to now\nready yeah kind I just need to now compile it. That's it. Okay. So now in\ncompile it. That's it. Okay. So now in\ncompile it. That's it. Okay. So now in order to compile your graph, okay, in\norder to compile your graph, okay, in\norder to compile your graph, okay, in order to compile your graph, you would\norder to compile your graph, you would\norder to compile your graph, you would need to first of all run this cell.\nneed to first of all run this cell.\nneed to first of all run this cell. Welcome is not defined. Very good. Very\nWelcome is not defined. Very good. Very\nWelcome is not defined. Very good. Very good. Very good. Do not run this\ngood. Very good. Do not run this\ngood. Very good. Do not run this function. F your function invalid\nfunction. F your function invalid\nfunction. F your function invalid syntax. What is Oh, okay. I forgot to\nsyntax. What is Oh, okay. I forgot to\nsyntax. What is Oh, okay. I forgot to add plus sign. By the way, I'm using\nadd plus sign. By the way, I'm using\nadd plus sign. By the way, I'm using fring. So why do I need to use plus\nfring. So why do I need to use plus\nfring. So why do I need to use plus sign? I will use my variable directly.\nsign? I will use my variable directly.\nsign? I will use my variable directly. That's the best thing about fstrings.\nThat's the best thing about fstrings.\nThat's the best thing about fstrings. Okay. Now I can just run this simple. So\nOkay. Now I can just run this simple. So\nOkay. Now I can just run this simple. So this langraph object is created. Now let\nthis langraph object is created. Now let\nthis langraph object is created. Now let me just say markdown.\nme just say markdown.\nme just say markdown. And let's say\nAnd let's say\nAnd let's say step three or four. Step four. Step four\nstep three or four. Step four. Step four\nstep three or four. Step four. Step four is compile the graph. Simple. So if I\nis compile the graph. Simple. So if I\nis compile the graph. Simple. So if I want to compile my graph, I again need\nwant to compile my graph, I again need\nwant to compile my graph, I again need to import something. So I will simply\nto import something. So I will simply\nto import something. So I will simply say from lang graph\nsay from lang graph\nsay from lang graph dot graph not graph this time. I think\ndot graph not graph this time. I think\ndot graph not graph this time. I think for compile I can simply compile it\nfor compile I can simply compile it\nfor compile I can simply compile it directly. I think so. Yeah, I think I\ndirectly. I think so. Yeah, I think I\ndirectly. I think so. Yeah, I think I can compile it directly. I can simply\ncan compile it directly. I can simply\ncan compile it directly. I can simply say um first graph\nsay um first graph\nsay um first graph equals\nequals\nequals my graph object which is graph here. See\nmy graph object which is graph here. See\nmy graph object which is graph here. See graph do compile\nsimple let me just run it. So this is\nsimple let me just run it. So this is completed. Wow this ran successfully.\ncompleted. Wow this ran successfully.\ncompleted. Wow this ran successfully. But do you know what? Whenever we run\nBut do you know what? Whenever we run\nBut do you know what? Whenever we run anything. Yeah. Whenever we run or\nanything. Yeah. Whenever we run or\nanything. Yeah. Whenever we run or basically create our first graph. We do\nbasically create our first graph. We do\nbasically create our first graph. We do not just want to compile it. We actually\nnot just want to compile it. We actually\nnot just want to compile it. We actually want to see it as well. So that we we\nwant to see it as well. So that we we\nwant to see it as well. So that we we can just make sure okay our graph is\ncan just make sure okay our graph is\ncan just make sure okay our graph is actually running fine. Make sense? So\nactually running fine. Make sense? So\nactually running fine. Make sense? So for that we have a very special library\nfor that we have a very special library\nfor that we have a very special library that we just use. It's called from I\nthat we just use. It's called from I\nthat we just use. It's called from I think they just keep on changing it but\nthink they just keep on changing it but\nthink they just keep on changing it but do not worry at all. IPython dot\ndo not worry at all. IPython dot\ndo not worry at all. IPython dot display. Yeah. Import image and then you\ndisplay. Yeah. Import image and then you\ndisplay. Yeah. Import image and then you can just import display. Simple. So this\ncan just import display. Simple. So this\ncan just import display. Simple. So this way you can actually import these\nway you can actually import these\nway you can actually import these things. So what will happen now? I will\nthings. So what will happen now? I will\nthings. So what will happen now? I will write one line of code and it will draw\nwrite one line of code and it will draw\nwrite one line of code and it will draw the mermaid diagram for you by default.\nthe mermaid diagram for you by default.\nthe mermaid diagram for you by default. Okay. And you have to write this code\nOkay. And you have to write this code\nOkay. And you have to write this code after. Let me just write that code. It\nafter. Let me just write that code. It\nafter. Let me just write that code. It goes like I think image. Okay. And then\ngoes like I think image. Okay. And then\ngoes like I think image. Okay. And then image\nimage\nimage graph or you can say your first graph\ngraph or you can say your first graph\ngraph or you can say your first graph whatever you have compiled. So in my\nwhatever you have compiled. So in my\nwhatever you have compiled. So in my case it is first graph and then you can\ncase it is first graph and then you can\ncase it is first graph and then you can use render but I will use dot get graph\nuse render but I will use dot get graph\nuse render but I will use dot get graph dot get graph and then you can use dot\ndot get graph and then you can use dot\ndot get graph and then you can use dot draw mermaid png.\ndraw mermaid png.\ndraw mermaid png. Simple and you need to make sure that\nSimple and you need to make sure that\nSimple and you need to make sure that you use exact same code otherwise you\nyou use exact same code otherwise you\nyou use exact same code otherwise you can see some errors. Let me just say\ncan see some errors. Let me just say\ncan see some errors. Let me just say display as well. Oh, it worked because\ndisplay as well. Oh, it worked because\ndisplay as well. Oh, it worked because I'm just using notebooks. So this is my\nI'm just using notebooks. So this is my\nI'm just using notebooks. So this is my graph. Wow.\ngraph. Wow.\ngraph. Wow. Start welcome node and then end.\nStart welcome node and then end.\nStart welcome node and then end. This is actually nice. Yes. So do you\nThis is actually nice. Yes. So do you\nThis is actually nice. Yes. So do you know what sometimes it works, sometime\nknow what sometimes it works, sometime\nknow what sometimes it works, sometime it doesn't work. It can throw you some\nit doesn't work. It can throw you some\nit doesn't work. It can throw you some errors related to some networking and\nerrors related to some networking and\nerrors related to some networking and some you will say like you are not in\nsome you will say like you are not in\nsome you will say like you are not in the um network or whatever. it can throw\nthe um network or whatever. it can throw\nthe um network or whatever. it can throw you some fishy errors. So if you see\nyou some fishy errors. So if you see\nyou some fishy errors. So if you see that error, okay, because I also like\nthat error, okay, because I also like\nthat error, okay, because I also like see that error usually. If you see that\nsee that error usually. If you see that\nsee that error usually. If you see that error, let me just write it.\nerror, let me just write it.\nerror, let me just write it. You could see the\nYou could see the\nYou could see the errors with the below command.\nYou can use\nYou can use the below command to see graph without\nthe below command to see graph without\nthe below command to see graph without errors.\nerrors.\nerrors. And I'm simply using this command print.\nAnd I'm simply using this command print.\nAnd I'm simply using this command print. Okay. And then I think first graph\nOkay. And then I think first graph\nOkay. And then I think first graph obviously then dot get graph dot draw\nobviously then dot get graph dot draw\nobviously then dot get graph dot draw mermaid. Let's try this thing. I think\nmermaid. Let's try this thing. I think\nmermaid. Let's try this thing. I think it should work. If I run this thing, do\nit should work. If I run this thing, do\nit should work. If I run this thing, do you know what will what will I see? I\nyou know what will what will I see? I\nyou know what will what will I see? I will see a code. Remember the same code\nwill see a code. Remember the same code\nwill see a code. Remember the same code that I just pasted in my whiteboard. So\nthat I just pasted in my whiteboard. So\nthat I just pasted in my whiteboard. So what you can do if this particular code\nwhat you can do if this particular code\nwhat you can do if this particular code doesn't work. Okay. You can use this\ndoesn't work. Okay. You can use this\ndoesn't work. Okay. You can use this code. What you will get? You will not\ncode. What you will get? You will not\ncode. What you will get? You will not get the graph obviously but you will get\nget the graph obviously but you will get\nget the graph obviously but you will get the code behind that graph. The code the\nthe code behind that graph. The code the\nthe code behind that graph. The code the running code behind that graph. See this\nrunning code behind that graph. See this\nrunning code behind that graph. See this graph is nothing but rendering this\ngraph is nothing but rendering this\ngraph is nothing but rendering this code. So what you can do then now\ncode. So what you can do then now\ncode. So what you can do then now because you just want to confirm like\nbecause you just want to confirm like\nbecause you just want to confirm like your DAG is running fine and you just\nyour DAG is running fine and you just\nyour DAG is running fine and you just want to visualize it, right? You can\nwant to visualize it, right? You can\nwant to visualize it, right? You can just copy everything. Okay. And then you\njust copy everything. Okay. And then you\njust copy everything. Okay. And then you can just paste it in the mermaid\ncan just paste it in the mermaid\ncan just paste it in the mermaid website. So simply go to any favorite\nwebsite. So simply go to any favorite\nwebsite. So simply go to any favorite browser and simply search let's say\nbrowser and simply search let's say\nbrowser and simply search let's say mermaid.live live\nmermaid.live live\nmermaid.live live and perfect it will maybe asking you to\nand perfect it will maybe asking you to\nand perfect it will maybe asking you to um you can say\num you can say\num you can say login so you can just login and see\nlogin so you can just login and see\nlogin so you can just login and see that's how you can just see this\nthat's how you can just see this\nthat's how you can just see this particular um your graph so this is\nparticular um your graph so this is\nparticular um your graph so this is another way I usually use this thing as\nanother way I usually use this thing as\nanother way I usually use this thing as well if I just want to let's say um\nwell if I just want to let's say um\nwell if I just want to let's say um render my\nrender my\nrender my graph and I'm seeing some errors due to\ngraph and I'm seeing some errors due to\ngraph and I'm seeing some errors due to any kind of networking thing because\nany kind of networking thing because\nany kind of networking thing because what that particular thing is trying to\nwhat that particular thing is trying to\nwhat that particular thing is trying to do it is trying to render your this code\ndo it is trying to render your this code\ndo it is trying to render your this code immediately within this server within\nimmediately within this server within\nimmediately within this server within your local server. Sometime it works,\nyour local server. Sometime it works,\nyour local server. Sometime it works, sometime it doesn't work. So you can\nsometime it doesn't work. So you can\nsometime it doesn't work. So you can just simply copy this code and for now\njust simply copy this code and for now\njust simply copy this code and for now I'm just simply commenting it out for\nI'm just simply commenting it out for\nI'm just simply commenting it out for you so that you can just use it if this\nyou so that you can just use it if this\nyou so that you can just use it if this code is not working. Simple. But for now\ncode is not working. Simple. But for now\ncode is not working. Simple. But for now my code is working fine. So I will just\nmy code is working fine. So I will just\nmy code is working fine. So I will just use this. This is my graph. This is my\nuse this. This is my graph. This is my\nuse this. This is my graph. This is my graph. Simple. Now finally our graph is\ngraph. Simple. Now finally our graph is\ngraph. Simple. Now finally our graph is fine as it is that we want. Now I will\nfine as it is that we want. Now I will\nfine as it is that we want. Now I will simply say that I want to invoke my\nsimply say that I want to invoke my\nsimply say that I want to invoke my graph. So now I will simply say step\ngraph. So now I will simply say step\ngraph. So now I will simply say step five\nfive\nfive run the graph. Now if I want to just run\nrun the graph. Now if I want to just run\nrun the graph. Now if I want to just run my graph I will simply say hey. Wow such\nmy graph I will simply say hey. Wow such\nmy graph I will simply say hey. Wow such a big cell. So here I will say I want to\na big cell. So here I will say I want to\na big cell. So here I will say I want to invoke the graph and I can just use the\ninvoke the graph and I can just use the\ninvoke the graph and I can just use the same dot invoke method. So I will say\nsame dot invoke method. So I will say\nsame dot invoke method. So I will say graph\ngraph\ngraph dot invoke. Okay. Why graph dot invoke?\ndot invoke. Okay. Why graph dot invoke?\ndot invoke. Okay. Why graph dot invoke? Because this is the graph that we\nBecause this is the graph that we\nBecause this is the graph that we compiled. Same keyword. Okay. Uh where\ncompiled. Same keyword. Okay. Uh where\ncompiled. Same keyword. Okay. Uh where is that? I think first graph. The one\nis that? I think first graph. The one\nis that? I think first graph. The one that we compiled. Okay. The one that we\nthat we compiled. Okay. The one that we\nthat we compiled. Okay. The one that we compiled. So I'll simply say first\ncompiled. So I'll simply say first\ncompiled. So I'll simply say first graph.\nFirst graph.voke. Now while invoking we\nFirst graph.voke. Now while invoking we have to make sure that we are following\nhave to make sure that we are following\nhave to make sure that we are following the schema. What is a schema? The schema\nthe schema. What is a schema? The schema\nthe schema. What is a schema? The schema is the first thing is name. Let's say my\nis the first thing is name. Let's say my\nis the first thing is name. Let's say my name is An.\nname is An.\nname is An. What is Let's say my name is An. And\nWhat is Let's say my name is An. And\nWhat is Let's say my name is An. And then message.\nMessage is um how are you?\nMessage is um how are you? Let's say I'm being nice. So I'm simply\nLet's say I'm being nice. So I'm simply\nLet's say I'm being nice. So I'm simply asking you how are you? This is my\nasking you how are you? This is my\nasking you how are you? This is my message. Now I want to invoke it. Now\nmessage. Now I want to invoke it. Now\nmessage. Now I want to invoke it. Now you will see\nyou will see\nyou will see the graph response. Now it will just\nthe graph response. Now it will just\nthe graph response. Now it will just simply executing a graph and perfect.\nsimply executing a graph and perfect.\nsimply executing a graph and perfect. What do I see now? Do I see a random\nWhat do I see now? Do I see a random\nWhat do I see now? Do I see a random message generated by AI? No. I see the\nmessage generated by AI? No. I see the\nmessage generated by AI? No. I see the response in the form of schema that I\nresponse in the form of schema that I\nresponse in the form of schema that I have defined. This is the power of\nhave defined.

Um if you just go to any search on any browser simply search\nany search on any browser simply search\nany search on any browser simply search let's say um advanced python and then\nlet's say um advanced python and then\nlet's say um advanced python and then just type an llama you will find a video\njust type an llama you will find a video\njust type an llama you will find a video for advanced python because I have two\nfor advanced python because I have two\nfor advanced python because I have two videos on python one is for like basics\nvideos on python one is for like basics\nvideos on python one is for like basics second one is for like python for AI\nsecond one is for like python for AI\nsecond one is for like python for AI engineering and senior level thing\nengineering and senior level thing\nengineering and senior level thing so this is the video this is like 4\nso this is the video this is like 4\nso this is the video this is like 4 hours course in this particular video\nhours course in this particular video\nhours course in this particular video just go to description or chapters you\njust go to description or chapters you\njust go to description or chapters you will find one dedicated chapter on\nwill find one dedicated chapter on\nwill find one dedicated chapter on pyantic so you can learn pyic in detail\npyantic so you can learn pyic in detail\npyantic so you can learn pyic in detail if you want to right so here you\nif you want to right so here you\nif you want to right so here you directly using pyantic and if you have\ndirectly using pyantic and if you have\ndirectly using pyantic and if you have some understanding about pyntic it's\nsome understanding about pyntic it's\nsome understanding about pyntic it's fine if you don't have um you can if you\nfine if you don't have um you can if you\nfine if you don't have um you can if you want to like you can learn it will be\nwant to like you can learn it will be\nwant to like you can learn it will be better for you if you do not want to\nbetter for you if you do not want to\nbetter for you if you do not want to learn in detail it's your choice because\nlearn in detail it's your choice because\nlearn in detail it's your choice because it's your life it's your career I cannot\nit's your life it's your career I cannot\nit's your life it's your career I cannot say anything but it's good for you it's\nsay anything but it's good for you it's\nsay anything but it's good for you it's my just a kind of suggestion now you are\nmy just a kind of suggestion now you are\nmy just a kind of suggestion now you are the owner who will take the suggestion\nthe owner who will take the suggestion\nthe owner who will take the suggestion or not right simple now and I'm not\nor not right simple now and I'm not\nor not right simple now and I'm not saying like you just need to follow my\nsaying like you just need to follow my\nsaying like you just need to follow my video not really you can just learn pyic\nvideo not really you can just learn pyic\nvideo not really you can just learn pyic from anywhere from the official\nfrom anywhere from the official\nfrom anywhere from the official documentation it will be beneficial for\ndocumentation it will be beneficial for\ndocumentation it will be beneficial for you especially in the AI data\nyou especially in the AI data\nyou especially in the AI data engineering AI engineering this kind of\nengineering AI engineering this kind of\nengineering AI engineering this kind of modern domains okay so now let's talk\nmodern domains okay so now let's talk\nmodern domains okay so now let's talk about pyic let's say I want to build the\nabout pyic let's say I want to build the\nabout pyic let's say I want to build the similar notebook like this right so do\nsimilar notebook like this right so do\nsimilar notebook like this right so do you know what will I do I will simply\nyou know what will I do I will simply\nyou know what will I do I will simply first of all copy this cell which is\nfirst of all copy this cell which is\nfirst of all copy this cell which is like boilerplate code so I will write it\nlike boilerplate code so I will write it\nlike boilerplate code so I will write it here and let me just close the terminal\nhere and let me just close the terminal\nhere and let me just close the terminal as well so this is my um you can say\nas well so this is my um you can say\nas well so this is my um you can say code code Okay, let me just run it. And\ncode code Okay, let me just run it. And\ncode code Okay, let me just run it. And this is the environment I want to pick.\nthis is the environment I want to pick.\nthis is the environment I want to pick. And after this, I will make sure that my\nAnd after this, I will make sure that my\nAnd after this, I will make sure that my model is up and running. So I will\nmodel is up and running. So I will\nmodel is up and running. So I will simply run this thing here.\nsimply run this thing here.\nsimply run this thing here. Okay, connecting to kernel blah blah\nOkay, connecting to kernel blah blah\nOkay, connecting to kernel blah blah blah.\nblah.\nblah. So let me just restart this VS code\nSo let me just restart this VS code\nSo let me just restart this VS code because I just um paused it in the\nbecause I just um paused it in the\nbecause I just um paused it in the middle. So maybe it is like stuck. So\nmiddle. So maybe it is like stuck. So\nmiddle. So maybe it is like stuck. So let me just restart it. So I have\nlet me just restart it. So I have\nlet me just restart it. So I have restarted it. Let me just rerun this\nrestarted it. Let me just rerun this\nrestarted it. Let me just rerun this cell.\ncell.\ncell. Um, perfect. It should now run fine.\nUm, perfect. It should now run fine.\nUm, perfect. It should now run fine. Perfect. So, if you just see these kinds\nPerfect. So, if you just see these kinds\nPerfect. So, if you just see these kinds of issues with your ID, simply restart\nof issues with your ID, simply restart\nof issues with your ID, simply restart the ID. Pro tip. So, let me just run\nthe ID. Pro tip. So, let me just run\nthe ID. Pro tip. So, let me just run this one. Perfect. So, now what we are\nthis one. Perfect. So, now what we are\nthis one. Perfect. So, now what we are just trying to build here, we will be\njust trying to build here, we will be\njust trying to build here, we will be working with pyic\nworking with pyic\nworking with pyic simple\nsimple\nsimple pyic graph. So now the graph will be a\npyic graph. So now the graph will be a\npyic graph. So now the graph will be a little bit you can say\nlittle bit you can say\nlittle bit you can say advanced kind of advanced or you can say\nadvanced kind of advanced or you can say\nadvanced kind of advanced or you can say a kind of extended. So what you will\na kind of extended. So what you will\na kind of extended. So what you will build right now you will the same\nbuild right now you will the same\nbuild right now you will the same developer will build a graph like this.\ndeveloper will build a graph like this.\ndeveloper will build a graph like this. So first of all you will build let's say\nSo first of all you will build let's say\nSo first of all you will build let's say start welcome and whatever but instead\nstart welcome and whatever but instead\nstart welcome and whatever but instead of just building this simple graph now\nof just building this simple graph now\nof just building this simple graph now let's actually level up because now your\nlet's actually level up because now your\nlet's actually level up because now your fundamentals are clear. So now you can\nfundamentals are clear. So now you can\nfundamentals are clear. So now you can just actually build some amazing things.\njust actually build some amazing things.\njust actually build some amazing things. So after starting you can say the graph\nSo after starting you can say the graph\nSo after starting you can say the graph I want to create here LLM right and here\nI want to create here LLM right and here\nI want to create here LLM right and here you can simply ask a question let's say\nyou can simply ask a question let's say\nyou can simply ask a question let's say lm query so you will query the llm\nlm query so you will query the llm\nlm query so you will query the llm simple then what you can do\nsimple then what you can do\nsimple then what you can do what is this arrow now what you can do\nwhat is this arrow now what you can do\nwhat is this arrow now what you can do you can simply add one more node and do\nyou can simply add one more node and do\nyou can simply add one more node and do you know what or let's say let's make it\nyou know what or let's say let's make it\nyou know what or let's say let's make it like a more real time thing so I will\nlike a more real time thing so I will\nlike a more real time thing so I will simply say generate create post. So this\nsimply say generate create post. So this\nsimply say generate create post. So this is a kind of node that I want to create\nis a kind of node that I want to create\nis a kind of node that I want to create to generate my post, my social media\nto generate my post, my social media\nto generate my post, my social media post, my LinkedIn post, anything simple\npost, my LinkedIn post, anything simple\npost, my LinkedIn post, anything simple on the basis of a topic. Simple. Now\non the basis of a topic. Simple. Now\non the basis of a topic. Simple. Now once it creates that this post content,\nonce it creates that this post content,\nonce it creates that this post content, okay, this content then I want to you\nokay, this content then I want to you\nokay, this content then I want to you can say tune it in what sense? in in in\ncan say tune it in what sense? in in in\ncan say tune it in what sense? in in in what sense like I want to let's say set\nwhat sense like I want to let's say set\nwhat sense like I want to let's say set a tone for this particular thing or you\na tone for this particular thing or you\na tone for this particular thing or you can say a kind of evaluator to make it\ncan say a kind of evaluator to make it\ncan say a kind of evaluator to make it more you can say human style readable\nmore you can say human style readable\nmore you can say human style readable and all of those things right now you\nand all of those things right now you\nand all of those things right now you will see on schlamba you can just pass\nwill see on schlamba you can just pass\nwill see on schlamba you can just pass on all the format things and all the\non all the format things and all the\non all the format things and all the details in this in this node why you\ndetails in this in this node why you\ndetails in this in this node why you want to create a different one first of\nwant to create a different one first of\nwant to create a different one first of all because you want to create\nall because you want to create\nall because you want to create multi-node architecture second usually\nmulti-node architecture second usually\nmulti-node architecture second usually we do not pass all the things to a\nwe do not pass all the things to a\nwe do not pass all the things to a single node it's not a good practice.\nsingle node it's not a good practice.\nsingle node it's not a good practice. You should always divide the work that\nYou should always divide the work that\nYou should always divide the work that you want to um get it done from the LLM\nyou want to um get it done from the LLM\nyou want to um get it done from the LLM in small small chunks because it\nin small small chunks because it\nin small small chunks because it performs the task better when you just\nperforms the task better when you just\nperforms the task better when you just provide only one task at a time very\nprovide only one task at a time very\nprovide only one task at a time very small small task. So this will be like\nsmall small task. So this will be like\nsmall small task. So this will be like generate post and this will be like um\ngenerate post and this will be like um\ngenerate post and this will be like um fine-tuning or let's say finetune post\nfine-tuning or let's say finetune post\nfine-tuning or let's say finetune post simple and then I want my response back\nsimple and then I want my response back\nsimple and then I want my response back simple a kind of more realtime graph and\nsimple a kind of more realtime graph and\nsimple a kind of more realtime graph and it will be like actually good and this\nit will be like actually good and this\nit will be like actually good and this will be powered by pantic because\nwill be powered by pantic because\nwill be powered by pantic because pyantic will take care of the schema\npyantic will take care of the schema\npyantic will take care of the schema instead of typed dictic\ninstead of typed dictic\ninstead of typed dictic is the hero here and pyantic will build\nis the hero here and pyantic will build\nis the hero here and pyantic will build the schema okay very good now let's try\nthe schema okay very good now let's try\nthe schema okay very good now let's try to build our schema So I will simply go\nto build our schema So I will simply go\nto build our schema So I will simply go to my pyic. So here I will say\nto my pyic. So here I will say\nto my pyic. So here I will say uh\npentic\npentic schema. Simple. So now in order to um\nschema. Simple. So now in order to um\nschema. Simple. So now in order to um you can say define the pyntic schema you\nyou can say define the pyntic schema you\nyou can say define the pyntic schema you need to import one package similar to\nneed to import one package similar to\nneed to import one package similar to typed dictect and we call it as base\ntyped dictect and we call it as base\ntyped dictect and we call it as base model. Base model is a basically a class\nmodel. Base model is a basically a class\nmodel. Base model is a basically a class available in the pyentric. So I will say\navailable in the pyentric. So I will say\navailable in the pyentric. So I will say from piantic\nfrom piantic\nfrom piantic import base model and I can also import\nimport base model and I can also import\nimport base model and I can also import field because when with piantic we can\nfield because when with piantic we can\nfield because when with piantic we can literally set some rules. Let's say I do\nliterally set some rules. Let's say I do\nliterally set some rules. Let's say I do not want any kind of null values. Um I\nnot want any kind of null values. Um I\nnot want any kind of null values. Um I want values within this range only. Um I\nwant values within this range only. Um I\nwant values within this range only. Um I want only these set of values. So we can\nwant only these set of values. So we can\nwant only these set of values. So we can actually perform so many things.\nactually perform so many things.\nactually perform so many things. Obviously we are not covering all of\nObviously we are not covering all of\nObviously we are not covering all of these things in detail because that will\nthese things in detail because that will\nthese things in detail because that will be a pyic master class. But yeah you\nbe a pyic master class. But yeah you\nbe a pyic master class. But yeah you should know about pyic. But for this\nshould know about pyic. But for this\nshould know about pyic. But for this lang graph we just need very basic\nlang graph we just need very basic\nlang graph we just need very basic understanding. So I will create a class\nunderstanding. So I will create a class\nunderstanding. So I will create a class similar to it. Let's say\nsimilar to it. Let's say\nsimilar to it. Let's say graph schema.\nOkay. And I will import base model.\nOkay. And I will import base model. Simple. Now similar to type dict I need\nSimple. Now similar to type dict I need\nSimple. Now similar to type dict I need to write my columns. Columns or you can\nto write my columns. Columns or you can\nto write my columns. Columns or you can say keys that I want. I want first of\nsay keys that I want. I want first of\nsay keys that I want. I want first of all\nall\nall topic like on which topic I want to\ntopic like on which topic I want to\ntopic like on which topic I want to generate the post right you can say\ngenerate the post right you can say\ngenerate the post right you can say equals like string. So in pyentic we\nequals like string. So in pyentic we\nequals like string. So in pyentic we also get amazing option called field in\nalso get amazing option called field in\nalso get amazing option called field in which we can just define some\nwhich we can just define some\nwhich we can just define some description and all simple\ndescription and all simple\ndescription and all simple and it is very handy when you are just\nand it is very handy when you are just\nand it is very handy when you are just passing on this information to LLM right\npassing on this information to LLM right\npassing on this information to LLM right because more information you pass to LLM\nbecause more information you pass to LLM\nbecause more information you pass to LLM better it will perform. So topic okay\nbetter it will perform. So topic okay\nbetter it will perform. So topic okay and here I will say um post\nand here I will say um post\nand here I will say um post okay post and this is obviously\nokay post and this is obviously\nokay post and this is obviously string and this will be field\nstring and this will be field\nstring and this will be field description let me just change it the\ndescription let me just change it the\ndescription let me just change it the LinkedIn post content and I will create\nLinkedIn post content and I will create\nLinkedIn post content and I will create one more key which is called curated\none more key which is called curated\none more key which is called curated post because I do not want to simply\npost because I do not want to simply\npost because I do not want to simply update the existing post that my LLM\nupdate the existing post that my LLM\nupdate the existing post that my LLM node one will Right. I want to store\nnode one will Right. I want to store\nnode one will Right. I want to store this updated information in the curated\nthis updated information in the curated\nthis updated information in the curated post. Simple. Okay. String equals to\npost. Simple. Okay. String equals to\npost. Simple. Okay. String equals to field and description curated link in\nfield and description curated link in\nfield and description curated link in post content. Perfect. Simple. And I\npost content. Perfect. Simple. And I\npost content. Perfect. Simple. And I don't want hashtag. So it's fine.\ndon't want hashtag. So it's fine.\ndon't want hashtag. So it's fine. Simple. So this is my class. Now this\nSimple. So this is my class. Now this\nSimple. So this is my class. Now this has become my pyantic model. Let me just\nhas become my pyantic model. Let me just\nhas become my pyantic model. Let me just show you how you can parse this object.\nshow you how you can parse this object.\nshow you how you can parse this object. Let's say I want to create an object for\nLet's say I want to create an object for\nLet's say I want to create an object for this particular class. So what I will do\nthis particular class. So what I will do\nthis particular class. So what I will do and this is just a demo. So I will\nand this is just a demo. So I will\nand this is just a demo. So I will simply say demo object equals graph\nsimply say demo object equals graph\nsimply say demo object equals graph schema and I can pass on some values for\nschema and I can pass on some values for\nschema and I can pass on some values for example topic and then I can say post\nexample topic and then I can say post\nexample topic and then I can say post and then I can say curated post like\nand then I can say curated post like\nand then I can say curated post like this simple. This is a very you can say\nthis simple. This is a very you can say\nthis simple. This is a very you can say hypothetical situation. So this is my\nhypothetical situation. So this is my\nhypothetical situation. So this is my thing. Now what is wrong? I think double\nthing. Now what is wrong? I think double\nthing. Now what is wrong? I think double quotes. Okay perfect. So this is my\nquotes. Okay perfect. So this is my\nquotes. Okay perfect. So this is my object. Now do you know what? Let me\nobject. Now do you know what? Let me\nobject. Now do you know what? Let me just parse this thing and you will see\njust parse this thing and you will see\njust parse this thing and you will see that it will work fine. Why? Because I\nthat it will work fine. Why? Because I\nthat it will work fine. Why? Because I am following all of the rules. Topic key\nam following all of the rules. Topic key\nam following all of the rules. Topic key is there, post is there, curated post is\nis there, post is there, curated post is\nis there, post is there, curated post is there. Perfect. Let me just run this and\nthere. Perfect. Let me just run this and\nthere. Perfect. Let me just run this and let me just show you. Print demo object.\nlet me just show you. Print demo object.\nlet me just show you. Print demo object. Okay. So you will see everything topic\nOkay. So you will see everything topic\nOkay. So you will see everything topic equals to this and created post equals\nequals to this and created post equals\nequals to this and created post equals to this. Everything is fine. Now if I\nto this. Everything is fine. Now if I\nto this. Everything is fine. Now if I make any mess here in this particular\nmake any mess here in this particular\nmake any mess here in this particular schema let's say I just by mistake\nschema let's say I just by mistake\nschema let's say I just by mistake you can say wrongly spell this let me\nyou can say wrongly spell this let me\nyou can say wrongly spell this let me just let's say write like this curated\njust let's say write like this curated\njust let's say write like this curated like this okay do you know what will\nlike this okay do you know what will\nlike this okay do you know what will happen it will fail it will say one\nhappen it will fail it will say one\nhappen it will fail it will say one validation error for graph schema so you\nvalidation error for graph schema so you\nvalidation error for graph schema so you cannot just simply pass this value and\ncannot just simply pass this value and\ncannot just simply pass this value and this is very important let's say you are\nthis is very important let's say you are\nthis is very important let's say you are invoking the schema through an external\ninvoking the schema through an external\ninvoking the schema through an external API and if that API does not follow all\nAPI and if that API does not follow all\nAPI and if that API does not follow all of these key pairs, it will not work.\nof these key pairs, it will not work.\nof these key pairs, it will not work. Okay, make sense? Make sense? Very good.\nOkay, make sense? Make sense? Very good.\nOkay, make sense? Make sense? Very good. So, we know that it works fine. So, now\nSo, we know that it works fine. So, now\nSo, we know that it works fine. So, now let's try to create the functions for\nlet's try to create the functions for\nlet's try to create the functions for nodes. So, I will quickly create the\nnodes. So, I will quickly create the\nnodes. So, I will quickly create the node functions. I will say def um and\nnode functions. I will say def um and\nnode functions. I will say def um and this will be like um create post. Okay,\nthis will be like um create post. Okay,\nthis will be like um create post. Okay, create post. And I want to get the\ncreate post. And I want to get the\ncreate post. And I want to get the state. State is this one. And what is\nstate. State is this one. And what is\nstate. State is this one. And what is the schema of state? Graph schema.\nthe schema of state? Graph schema.\nthe schema of state? Graph schema. Perfect. and it returns the graph\nPerfect. and it returns the graph\nPerfect. and it returns the graph schema.\nschema.\nschema. Perfect.\nPerfect.\nPerfect. Here I will first of all get the state\nHere I will first of all get the state\nHere I will first of all get the state of it like topic because I need topic to\nof it like topic because I need topic to\nof it like topic because I need topic to send it to LM. Right? So I will simply\nsend it to LM. Right? So I will simply\nsend it to LM. Right? So I will simply say topic equals to state dot topic. Now\nsay topic equals to state dot topic. Now\nsay topic equals to state dot topic. Now this is very interesting. Now you will\nthis is very interesting. Now you will\nthis is very interesting. Now you will say an Lamba in first example we treated\nsay an Lamba in first example we treated\nsay an Lamba in first example we treated our\nour\nour state as a dictionary. See, but here you\nstate as a dictionary. See, but here you\nstate as a dictionary. See, but here you are using dot notation because this is a\nare using dot notation because this is a\nare using dot notation because this is a pyantic object. Make sense? And pyantic\npyantic object. Make sense? And pyantic\npyantic object. Make sense? And pyantic object we use or we fetch the\nobject we use or we fetch the\nobject we use or we fetch the information with dot notation. If you\ninformation with dot notation. If you\ninformation with dot notation. If you want to treat it like a dictionary that\nwant to treat it like a dictionary that\nwant to treat it like a dictionary that I personally like as well because I\nI personally like as well because I\nI personally like as well because I don't like this dot notation. You can\ndon't like this dot notation. You can\ndon't like this dot notation. You can convert your pentic object into a\nconvert your pentic object into a\nconvert your pentic object into a dictionary into a JSON using this one.\ndictionary into a JSON using this one.\ndictionary into a JSON using this one. Let's say state\nLet's say state\nLet's say state equals\nequals\nequals state dot model dump. So this is a\nstate dot model dump. So this is a\nstate dot model dump. So this is a function that converts your pyantic\nfunction that converts your pyantic\nfunction that converts your pyantic object into a dictionary. Now you can\nobject into a dictionary. Now you can\nobject into a dictionary. Now you can just use this thing. Simple.\njust use this thing. Simple.\njust use this thing. Simple. I can say converting pyic model to a\nI can say converting pyic model to a\nI can say converting pyic model to a dictionary. Perfect. AI is here. So\ndictionary. Perfect. AI is here. So\ndictionary. Perfect. AI is here. So topic we have got the topic. So I can\ntopic we have got the topic. So I can\ntopic we have got the topic. So I can say extract the topic from the state.\nsay extract the topic from the state.\nsay extract the topic from the state. Now you already know. I will simply say\nNow you already know. I will simply say\nNow you already know. I will simply say passing the topic to lm to generate a\npassing the topic to lm to generate a\npassing the topic to lm to generate a LinkedIn post. Simple. So llm.invoke\nLinkedIn post. Simple. So llm.invoke\nLinkedIn post. Simple. So llm.invoke write a LinkedIn post about topic dot\nwrite a LinkedIn post about topic dot\nwrite a LinkedIn post about topic dot content. Very good. Very very very good.\ncontent. Very good. Very very very good.\ncontent. Very good. Very very very good. So that's how you can just make sure\nSo that's how you can just make sure\nSo that's how you can just make sure that you are just passing on these\nthat you are just passing on these\nthat you are just passing on these things. Simple. So this is my post.\nthings. Simple. So this is my post.\nthings. Simple. So this is my post. Okay. And now I can just update the\nOkay. And now I can just update the\nOkay. And now I can just update the post. So update the state with the\npost. So update the state with the\npost. So update the state with the generated post. State of post is equals\ngenerated post. State of post is equals\ngenerated post. State of post is equals post and return the state.\npost and return the state.\npost and return the state. return the state. Simple. So this node\nreturn the state. Simple. So this node\nreturn the state. Simple. So this node is done. Let me just create another\nis done. Let me just create another\nis done. Let me just create another function.\nfunction.\nfunction.

So here what I need to get I simply need\nSo here what I need to get I simply need\nSo here what I need to get I simply need to first of all convert the state into\nto first of all convert the state into\nto first of all convert the state into model term so that I can just convert it\nmodel term so that I can just convert it\nmodel term so that I can just convert it into a dictionary. simple and then I\ninto a dictionary. simple and then I\ninto a dictionary. simple and then I will extract the post from the state\nwill extract the post from the state\nwill extract the post from the state using post and then I will pass this\nusing post and then I will pass this\nusing post and then I will pass this thing to LM and I will simply say hey\nthing to LM and I will simply say hey\nthing to LM and I will simply say hey curate the following LinkedIn post and\ncurate the following LinkedIn post and\ncurate the following LinkedIn post and that's it or I can say curate the\nthat's it or I can say curate the\nthat's it or I can say curate the following LinkedIn post with\nfollowing LinkedIn post with\nfollowing LinkedIn post with genz tone something like this right\ngenz tone something like this right\ngenz tone something like this right so now simple I can simply update the\nso now simple I can simply update the\nso now simple I can simply update the state state and return state simple my\nstate state and return state simple my\nstate state and return state simple my two node functions functions are done\ntwo node functions functions are done\ntwo node functions functions are done simple I hope it was easy because we\nsimple I hope it was easy because we\nsimple I hope it was easy because we have already covered these fundament\nhave already covered these fundament\nhave already covered these fundament funamentals and this is very very easy.\nfunamentals and this is very very easy.\nfunamentals and this is very very easy. Perfect. So now what I need to do I\nPerfect. So now what I need to do I\nPerfect. So now what I need to do I simply need to create my graph and how I\nsimply need to create my graph and how I\nsimply need to create my graph and how I can just create the graph\ncan just create the graph\ncan just create the graph let's say graph\nequals uh here you will first of all\nequals uh here you will first of all import the state graph\nimport the state graph\nimport the state graph from lang graph\nfrom lang graph\nfrom lang graph dot graph\ndot graph\ndot graph import graph\nimport graph\nimport graph I think state graph perfect state graph\nI think state graph perfect state graph\nI think state graph perfect state graph start\nAnd perfect. So here I will say graph\nAnd perfect. So here I will say graph equals to state graph. Perfect. And here\nequals to state graph. Perfect. And here\nequals to state graph. Perfect. And here you can just pass your schema of the\nyou can just pass your schema of the\nyou can just pass your schema of the state graph. I will say graph schema.\nstate graph. I will say graph schema.\nstate graph. I will say graph schema. Perfect. And then you can say\nPerfect. And then you can say\nPerfect. And then you can say graph dot add node which is this one.\ngraph dot add node which is this one.\ngraph dot add node which is this one. And then I will not add edge by the way.\nAnd then I will not add edge by the way.\nAnd then I will not add edge by the way. I prefer creating first of all nodes and\nI prefer creating first of all nodes and\nI prefer creating first of all nodes and then I just create the edges. So I'll\nthen I just create the edges. So I'll\nthen I just create the edges. So I'll simply say add node. Let me just\nsimply say add node. Let me just\nsimply say add node. Let me just register the nodes. So this is my first\nregister the nodes. So this is my first\nregister the nodes. So this is my first node and this is my second node.\nnode and this is my second node.\nnode and this is my second node. Perfect. And my other two nodes are\nPerfect. And my other two nodes are\nPerfect. And my other two nodes are already created by the langraph.\nalready created by the langraph.\nalready created by the langraph. Perfect. So now\nPerfect. So now\nPerfect. So now let me just create the edges. So this is\nlet me just create the edges. So this is\nlet me just create the edges. So this is my first edge.\nmy first edge.\nmy first edge. This is my second edge from curate post\nThis is my second edge from curate post\nThis is my second edge from curate post node to like create post node to curate\nnode to like create post node to curate\nnode to like create post node to curate post. Simple, self-explanatory. Very\npost. Simple, self-explanatory. Very\npost. Simple, self-explanatory. Very good. Then my last edge is this one. Now\ngood. Then my last edge is this one. Now\ngood. Then my last edge is this one. Now let's try to compile it. Okay. So I will\nlet's try to compile it. Okay. So I will\nlet's try to compile it. Okay. So I will say graph or you can say pentic graph\nequals graph.compile\nequals graph.compile simple. And I also want to display that\nsimple. And I also want to display that\nsimple. And I also want to display that amazing\namazing\namazing graph. So let's do it.\nAnd let me just import it here.\nAnd let me just import it here. Yeah, let's write it here.\nOkay. So, are you ready to run this?\nOkay. So, are you ready to run this? Very good. Create post is not defined\nVery good. Create post is not defined\nVery good. Create post is not defined because we didn't run this. Perfect.\nbecause we didn't run this. Perfect.\nbecause we didn't run this. Perfect. Now, let's run this.\nNow, let's run this.\nNow, let's run this. So, let's see what do we get. Perfect.\nSo, let's see what do we get. Perfect.\nSo, let's see what do we get. Perfect. Start, create post, curate post, and\nStart, create post, curate post, and\nStart, create post, curate post, and end. This is your\nend. This is your\nend. This is your graph. Very good.\ngraph. Very good.\ngraph. Very good. Now\nNow\nNow we need to invoke the graph just to test\nwe need to invoke the graph just to test\nwe need to invoke the graph just to test it. So I will simply say\nit. So I will simply say\nit. So I will simply say graph or you can say identic graph dot\ngraph or you can say identic graph dot\ngraph or you can say identic graph dot invoke. Now this step is very important\ninvoke. Now this step is very important\ninvoke. Now this step is very important because now you need to pass the schema\nbecause now you need to pass the schema\nbecause now you need to pass the schema and what is the schema? First of all\nand what is the schema? First of all\nand what is the schema? First of all topic topic is let's say importance of\ntopic topic is let's say importance of\ntopic topic is let's say importance of digital age in this this this thing.\ndigital age in this this this thing.\ndigital age in this this this thing. Right now you know that you do not have\nRight now you know that you do not have\nRight now you know that you do not have any kind of other key. You do not have\nany kind of other key. You do not have\nany kind of other key. You do not have let's say post. Right? Obviously you do\nlet's say post. Right? Obviously you do\nlet's say post. Right? Obviously you do not have. So you will keep it empty.\nnot have. So you will keep it empty.\nnot have. So you will keep it empty. Simple. And you have let's say curated\nSimple. And you have let's say curated\nSimple. And you have let's say curated post\npost\npost and you will keep it empty. Simple.\nand you will keep it empty. Simple.\nand you will keep it empty. Simple. Simple. Now let's try to run this one\nSimple. Now let's try to run this one\nSimple. Now let's try to run this one validation error for graph schema. Why?\nvalidation error for graph schema. Why?\nvalidation error for graph schema. Why? Let me show you. So it is saying\nLet me show you. So it is saying\nLet me show you. So it is saying validation error for this curate post\nvalidation error for this curate post\nvalidation error for this curate post because I made a mistake.\nbecause I made a mistake.\nbecause I made a mistake. What is curate post? P identic does not\nWhat is curate post? P identic does not\nWhat is curate post? P identic does not understand anything that's why I just\nunderstand anything that's why I just\nunderstand anything that's why I just made this m mistake. It is not curate\nmade this m mistake. It is not curate\nmade this m mistake. It is not curate post it is curated post. Right? So that\npost it is curated post. Right? So that\npost it is curated post. Right? So that is the importance of pyic.\nis the importance of pyic.\nis the importance of pyic. Make sense? And you wouldn't see this\nMake sense? And you wouldn't see this\nMake sense? And you wouldn't see this error in typed dict\nerror in typed dict\nerror in typed dict really. Yeah, you wouldn't see this\nreally. Yeah, you wouldn't see this\nreally. Yeah, you wouldn't see this thing. So when you want to make your\nthing. So when you want to make your\nthing. So when you want to make your graph\ngraph\ngraph work with strict rules and in the real\nwork with strict rules and in the real\nwork with strict rules and in the real world we have to make strict rules then\nworld we have to make strict rules then\nworld we have to make strict rules then yes you have to have to have to use pyic\nyes you have to have to have to use pyic\nyes you have to have to have to use pyic so it will take some time okay let's\nso it will take some time okay let's\nso it will take some time okay let's wait\nwait\nwait okay see we have got the things topic\nokay see we have got the things topic\nokay see we have got the things topic post post post and curated post simple\npost post post and curated post simple\npost post post and curated post simple and this is the magic this is the magic\nand this is the magic this is the magic\nand this is the magic this is the magic now a quick question yeah I know what is\nnow a quick question yeah I know what is\nnow a quick question yeah I know what is your\nyour\nyour What if I just pass topic and I do not\nWhat if I just pass topic and I do not\nWhat if I just pass topic and I do not pass these things. What will happen?\npass these things. What will happen?\npass these things. What will happen? Because I do not have any kind of\nBecause I do not have any kind of\nBecause I do not have any kind of information. So just keeping it null or\ninformation. So just keeping it null or\ninformation. So just keeping it null or empty. What if I just pass this? What\nempty. What if I just pass this? What\nempty. What if I just pass this? What will happen? You know, you know, you\nwill happen? You know, you know, you\nwill happen? You know, you know, you already know it will not accept it. It\nalready know it will not accept it. It\nalready know it will not accept it. It will say I have to have to have to keep\nwill say I have to have to have to keep\nwill say I have to have to have to keep those\nthose\nthose you can say keys.\nyou can say keys.\nyou can say keys. Make sense? So it will simply say you\nMake sense? So it will simply say you\nMake sense? So it will simply say you need to pass those keys as well. So yes,\nneed to pass those keys as well. So yes,\nneed to pass those keys as well. So yes, you can just keep it empty which is a\nyou can just keep it empty which is a\nyou can just keep it empty which is a very normal practice but you have to\nvery normal practice but you have to\nvery normal practice but you have to pass the schema. It will only check the\npass the schema. It will only check the\npass the schema. It will only check the schema. Simple. So now let me just tell\nschema. Simple. So now let me just tell\nschema. Simple. So now let me just tell you very important topic which is which\nyou very important topic which is which\nyou very important topic which is which will like actually enhance your\nwill like actually enhance your\nwill like actually enhance your understanding about how graph is working\nunderstanding about how graph is working\nunderstanding about how graph is working under the hood. Okay. And this is very\nunder the hood. Okay. And this is very\nunder the hood. Okay. And this is very important. Let me just talk about it.\nimportant. Let me just talk about it.\nimportant. Let me just talk about it. Let's wait for this response. Let's see\nLet's wait for this response. Let's see\nLet's wait for this response. Let's see what it will write this time.\nwhat it will write this time.\nwhat it will write this time. Bro, you're taking so much of time. Let\nBro, you're taking so much of time. Let\nBro, you're taking so much of time. Let me just show you directly. So now if I\nme just show you directly. So now if I\nme just show you directly. So now if I go to let's say um my functions. See\ngo to let's say um my functions. See\ngo to let's say um my functions. See here. So these are my two functions\nhere. So these are my two functions\nhere. So these are my two functions here. Let's say this is node one. This\nhere. Let's say this is node one. This\nhere. Let's say this is node one. This is node two. Let me just draw it. So\nis node two. Let me just draw it. So\nis node two. Let me just draw it. So let's say generate post. Simple. This is\nlet's say generate post. Simple. This is\nlet's say generate post. Simple. This is my generate post.\nLet's say generate post and then I have\nLet's say generate post and then I have fine-tuned post or let's say curated\nfine-tuned post or let's say curated\nfine-tuned post or let's say curated post\nyeah let's keep it because we know like\nyeah let's keep it because we know like we have used the different names so it's\nwe have used the different names so it's\nwe have used the different names so it's fine.\nfine.\nfine. So let's say like this.\nSo let's say like this.\nSo let's say like this. Perfect. Do you know what?\nNever ever think that output of this\nNever ever think that output of this node will be treated as the input of\nnode will be treated as the input of\nnode will be treated as the input of this node.\nthis node.\nthis node. Never. Because this is a very common\nNever. Because this is a very common\nNever. Because this is a very common practice when we work with lang chain.\nIt's making so much of noise. Right now\nIt's making so much of noise. Right now it's good. So yeah, never ever think\nit's good. So yeah, never ever think\nit's good. So yeah, never ever think that the output of this node will be the\nthat the output of this node will be the\nthat the output of this node will be the input of this node. Never.\ninput of this node. Never.\ninput of this node. Never. Lang chain works on this particular\nLang chain works on this particular\nLang chain works on this particular principle when the output of one there\nprinciple when the output of one there\nprinciple when the output of one there we do not have nodes but let's say one\nwe do not have nodes but let's say one\nwe do not have nodes but let's say one function is the input of the second one.\nfunction is the input of the second one.\nfunction is the input of the second one. Why? Because we do not have the stateful\nWhy? Because we do not have the stateful\nWhy? Because we do not have the stateful orchestration.\norchestration.\norchestration. that is the biggest advantage. So I can\nthat is the biggest advantage. So I can\nthat is the biggest advantage. So I can say\nsay\nsay um in lang chain\nthe\nthe output of\noutput of\noutput of one node is the input of\none node is the input of\none node is the input of of the next node.\nof the next node.\nof the next node. But\nBut\nBut in\nin\nin lang graph\nthe\nthe input or you can say in lang graph it's\ninput or you can say in lang graph it's\ninput or you can say in lang graph it's not the case. So how our\nnot the case. So how our\nnot the case. So how our next node is using the content which is\nnext node is using the content which is\nnext node is using the content which is updated by the this node. Let me just\nupdated by the this node. Let me just\nupdated by the this node. Let me just tell you so what what will happen. Let's\ntell you so what what will happen. Let's\ntell you so what what will happen. Let's say I am executing this node. Okay. So\nsay I am executing this node. Okay. So\nsay I am executing this node. Okay. So there is a special area where we store\nthere is a special area where we store\nthere is a special area where we store the state right. So this area is called\nthe state right. So this area is called\nthe state right. So this area is called state schema that we create\nstate schema. So now when I will execute\nstate schema. So now when I will execute this node or not I like let's say lang\nthis node or not I like let's say lang\nthis node or not I like let's say lang graph is executing this node it will\ngraph is executing this node it will\ngraph is executing this node it will execute the node. It will make the\nexecute the node. It will make the\nexecute the node. It will make the changes in the schema dictionary and it\nchanges in the schema dictionary and it\nchanges in the schema dictionary and it will save that information here.\nwill save that information here.\nwill save that information here. Okay, here\nOkay, here\nOkay, here now when this node will be running the\nnow when this node will be running the\nnow when this node will be running the input of this node is the state schema\ninput of this node is the state schema\ninput of this node is the state schema not the output of this function. So this\nnot the output of this function. So this\nnot the output of this function. So this will utilize this schema automatically\nwill utilize this schema automatically\nwill utilize this schema automatically simple\nsimple. So output of this is not the\nsimple. So output of this is not the input of this node. This will just\ninput of this node. This will just\ninput of this node. This will just update the state schema and state schema\nupdate the state schema and state schema\nupdate the state schema and state schema will automatically go inside this\nwill automatically go inside this\nwill automatically go inside this particular node or I can say node one\nparticular node or I can say node one\nparticular node or I can say node one just for the understanding for generic\njust for the understanding for generic\njust for the understanding for generic understanding\nunderstanding\nunderstanding let's say node two make sense so this\nlet's say node two make sense so this\nlet's say node two make sense so this output will be not be the input of this\noutput will be not be the input of this\noutput will be not be the input of this thing so they are simply using the state\nthing so they are simply using the state\nthing so they are simply using the state schema wow and what if let's say I have\nschema wow and what if let's say I have\nschema wow and what if let's say I have another node same thing same thing so\nanother node same thing same thing so\nanother node same thing same thing so what will happen Here\nwhat will happen Here\nwhat will happen Here you will be having state schema like\nyou will be having state schema like\nyou will be having state schema like this. So now this will update the\nthis. So now this will update the\nthis. So now this will update the information in the state schema. Let's\ninformation in the state schema. Let's\ninformation in the state schema. Let's say let's say like this. Okay. And this\nsay let's say like this. Okay. And this\nsay let's say like this. Okay. And this is let's say node 3.\nis let's say node 3.\nis let's say node 3. And this will write it here.\nAnd this will write it here.\nAnd this will write it here. Oh\nOh\nOh yes. That's how it works.\nyes. That's how it works.\nyes. That's how it works. Simple.\nSimple.\nSimple. So node 3 will automatically pick the\nSo node 3 will automatically pick the\nSo node 3 will automatically pick the information from here.\ninformation from here.\ninformation from here. Okay. So they never share the output and\nOkay. So they never share the output and\nOkay. So they never share the output and input with each other. They always share\ninput with each other. They always share\ninput with each other. They always share the state schema. They always share the\nthe state schema. They always share the\nthe state schema. They always share the state schema.\nstate schema.\nstate schema. I hope it makes sense and I hope it is\nI hope it makes sense and I hope it is\nI hope it makes sense and I hope it is clear this specifically.\nclear this specifically.\nclear this specifically. Simple. Just make sure this is like the\nSimple. Just make sure this is like the\nSimple. Just make sure this is like the backbone of the understanding of the\nbackbone of the understanding of the\nbackbone of the understanding of the nodes and this is the biggest advantage\nnodes and this is the biggest advantage\nnodes and this is the biggest advantage over lang lang chain when we just work\nover lang lang chain when we just work\nover lang lang chain when we just work with lang graph make sense okay very\nwith lang graph make sense okay very\nwith lang graph make sense okay very well done so now let's talk about a\nwell done so now let's talk about a\nwell done so now let's talk about a concept called messages\nconcept called messages\nconcept called messages so whenever we just chat with the llm\nso whenever we just chat with the llm\nso whenever we just chat with the llm most of the time we deal in the messages\nmost of the time we deal in the messages\nmost of the time we deal in the messages and you have already seen one type of\nand you have already seen one type of\nand you have already seen one type of message which is called AI message when\nmessage which is called AI message when\nmessage which is called AI message when we just made the API call you saw that\nwe just made the API call you saw that\nwe just made the API call you saw that the messages.\nthe messages.\nthe messages. So now let me just share an important\nSo now let me just share an important\nSo now let me just share an important concept with you which is called\nconcept with you which is called\nconcept with you which is called messages. We do not have just like one\nmessages. We do not have just like one\nmessages. We do not have just like one type of messages. We do not have just\ntype of messages.

We have so many other types of messages as well. For example,\ntypes of messages as well. For example,\ntypes of messages as well. For example, first of all, we have let's say\nfirst of all, we have let's say\nfirst of all, we have let's say something called as\nsomething called as\nsomething called as AI message. Let's start with this one.\nAI message. Let's start with this one.\nAI message. Let's start with this one. AI message. We have this thing simple\nAI message. We have this thing simple\nAI message. We have this thing simple AI message. AI message means the\nAI message. AI message means the\nAI message. AI message means the response that we get from the AI.

So that means whenever I'm just ask\nthat means whenever I'm just ask\nthat means whenever I'm just ask whenever I am asking anything from LLM\nwhenever I am asking anything from LLM\nwhenever I am asking anything from LLM whenever I am saying that hey I want to\nwhenever I am saying that hey I want to\nwhenever I am saying that hey I want to know this thing that is my message\nknow this thing that is my message\nknow this thing that is my message because I am messaging right that is the\nbecause I am messaging right that is the\nbecause I am messaging right that is the human message. Perfect. There's one type\nhuman message. Perfect. There's one type\nhuman message. Perfect. There's one type of message which is very popular.\nof message which is very popular.\nof message which is very popular. System message. Now what is the system\nSystem message. Now what is the system\nSystem message. Now what is the system message? This is called\nmessage? This is called\nmessage? This is called very very very\nvery very very\nvery very very highlevel finetuning of LLM. Not really\nhighlevel finetuning of LLM. Not really\nhighlevel finetuning of LLM. Not really fine tuning but setting the tone of the\nfine tuning but setting the tone of the\nfine tuning but setting the tone of the LLM. So let's say I am talking to the\nLLM. So let's say I am talking to the\nLLM. So let's say I am talking to the LLM. By default LLM's tone is like by\nLLM. By default LLM's tone is like by\nLLM. By default LLM's tone is like by default like which is set in the\ndefault like which is set in the\ndefault like which is set in the background.\nbackground.\nbackground. Now you can set the tone, you can set\nNow you can set the tone, you can set\nNow you can set the tone, you can set the behavior, you can just give some\nthe behavior, you can just give some\nthe behavior, you can just give some directions to your LLM that hey you are\ndirections to your LLM that hey you are\ndirections to your LLM that hey you are a professional content writer. Hey you\na professional content writer. Hey you\na professional content writer. Hey you are a professional um you can say blog\nare a professional um you can say blog\nare a professional um you can say blog writer you are a something like this you\nwriter you are a something like this you\nwriter you are a something like this you are this you are that you can provide\nare this you are that you can provide\nare this you are that you can provide this this information what will be the\nthis this information what will be the\nthis this information what will be the benefit of it it's not magic that LLM\nbenefit of it it's not magic that LLM\nbenefit of it it's not magic that LLM will become the content writer or you\nwill become the content writer or you\nwill become the content writer or you can say blog writer but LLM will take\ncan say blog writer but LLM will take\ncan say blog writer but LLM will take this or you can say consider this every\nthis or you can say consider this every\nthis or you can say consider this every time whenever it will be generating the\ntime whenever it will be generating the\ntime whenever it will be generating the response so we can give the highlevel\nresponse so we can give the highlevel\nresponse so we can give the highlevel guidance towards the llm\nguidance towards the llm\nguidance towards the llm Okay, simple. Okay, there is one more\nOkay, simple. Okay, there is one more\nOkay, simple. Okay, there is one more type of message which is called tool\ntype of message which is called tool\ntype of message which is called tool message.\nmessage.\nmessage. So let's say you want to just create\nSo let's say you want to just create\nSo let's say you want to just create tools and you want to integrate tools\ntools and you want to integrate tools\ntools and you want to integrate tools and we'll be just learning about how to\nand we'll be just learning about how to\nand we'll be just learning about how to create tools in Langraph. So you can\ncreate tools in Langraph. So you can\ncreate tools in Langraph. So you can create tool and the response that you\ncreate tool and the response that you\ncreate tool and the response that you will be getting from the tool will be\nwill be getting from the tool will be\nwill be getting from the tool will be the tool message. Here in Langraph we\nthe tool message. Here in Langraph we\nthe tool message. Here in Langraph we create functions for tools, right? So\ncreate functions for tools, right? So\ncreate functions for tools, right? So you can also consider it as function\nyou can also consider it as function\nyou can also consider it as function message or tool message. Simple. So\nmessage or tool message. Simple. So\nmessage or tool message. Simple. So these are like four major ones and yeah\nthese are like four major ones and yeah\nthese are like four major ones and yeah these are the four major ones that you\nthese are the four major ones that you\nthese are the four major ones that you just need to know. Okay. So let me just\njust need to know. Okay. So let me just\njust need to know. Okay. So let me just make a single line for all of these\nmake a single line for all of these\nmake a single line for all of these messages.\nmessages.\nmessages. Simple. Very good. So these are four\nSimple. Very good. So these are four\nSimple. Very good. So these are four different types of messages that we\ndifferent types of messages that we\ndifferent types of messages that we have. Now let's see what is the\nhave. Now let's see what is the\nhave. Now let's see what is the advantage of it. See the example that we\nadvantage of it. See the example that we\nadvantage of it. See the example that we have just built like is actually very\nhave just built like is actually very\nhave just built like is actually very useful. But now we'll be just learning\nuseful. But now we'll be just learning\nuseful. But now we'll be just learning about some advanced things. Okay.\nabout some advanced things. Okay.\nabout some advanced things. Okay. Because whenever we work with langraph,\nBecause whenever we work with langraph,\nBecause whenever we work with langraph, we want to keep the you can say\nwe want to keep the you can say\nwe want to keep the you can say conversation\nconversation\nconversation um continued.\num continued.\num continued. We want to make sure that we are\nWe want to make sure that we are\nWe want to make sure that we are providing all the context to the future\nproviding all the context to the future\nproviding all the context to the future nodes. For example,\nnodes. For example,\nnodes. For example, let's say\nlet's say\nlet's say let me just draw the graph for you. So\nlet me just draw the graph for you. So\nlet me just draw the graph for you. So let's say you have to build\nlet's say you have to build\nlet's say you have to build messages graph.\nWhat do I mean? So let's say you are a\nWhat do I mean? So let's say you are a user. Okay. Let's say you are this user.\nuser. Okay. Let's say you are this user.\nuser. Okay. Let's say you are this user. Perfect.\nSo now what you will do?\nSo now what you will do? You will use this thing. Let's say open\nYou will use this thing. Let's say open\nYou will use this thing. Let's say open AI, right? Perfect. So now here let's\nAI, right? Perfect. So now here let's\nAI, right? Perfect. So now here let's say this is your one node okay node\nsay this is your one node okay node\nsay this is your one node okay node number one. Now I have the schema let's\nnumber one. Now I have the schema let's\nnumber one. Now I have the schema let's say called messages\nsay called messages\nsay called messages right I have the schema called messages.\nright I have the schema called messages.\nright I have the schema called messages. So my messages will be like this, right?\nSo my messages will be like this, right?\nSo my messages will be like this, right? Let's say\nLet's say\nLet's say um something okay let's say message one\num something okay let's say message one\num something okay let's say message one simple\nsimple\nsimple very good message one okay this is the\nvery good message one okay this is the\nvery good message one okay this is the initial schema or let's say let let me\ninitial schema or let's say let let me\ninitial schema or let's say let let me just expand the schema let's say we have\njust expand the schema let's say we have\njust expand the schema let's say we have this thing as well let's say input\nthis thing as well let's say input\nthis thing as well let's say input simple\nsimple\nsimple let's say input so it will be your user\nlet's say input so it will be your user\nlet's say input so it will be your user query\nOkay,\nOkay, makes sense. So this is my schema. So\nmakes sense. So this is my schema. So\nmakes sense. So this is my schema. So here when I will start my application\nhere when I will start my application\nhere when I will start my application here the messages will be empty\nhere the messages will be empty\nhere the messages will be empty obviously because messages is the AI\nobviously because messages is the AI\nobviously because messages is the AI message right and when this will process\nmessage right and when this will process\nmessage right and when this will process this node this will populate this\nthis node this will populate this\nthis node this will populate this message make sense but now when I will\nmessage make sense but now when I will\nmessage make sense but now when I will be going to my next node\nbe going to my next node\nbe going to my next node okay when I'll be just going to my next\nokay when I'll be just going to my next\nokay when I'll be just going to my next node\nnode\nnode then if I take this input and I just you\nthen if I take this input and I just you\nthen if I take this input and I just you can say change it simple let's say this\ncan say change it simple let's say this\ncan say change it simple let's say this is changed then obviously this will\nis changed then obviously this will\nis changed then obviously this will become my message two right but where is\nbecome my message two right but where is\nbecome my message two right but where is my message one I want to access message\nmy message one I want to access message\nmy message one I want to access message one as well\none as well\none as well make sense right I want to access my\nmake sense right I want to access my\nmake sense right I want to access my message one as well so in that\nmessage one as well so in that\nmessage one as well so in that particular scenario I need to make sure\nparticular scenario I need to make sure\nparticular scenario I need to make sure that I am not simply overwriting it I am\nthat I am not simply overwriting it I am\nthat I am not simply overwriting it I am doing like this message one plus message\ndoing like this message one plus message\ndoing like this message one plus message two so that I can see the message one as\ntwo so that I can see the message one as\ntwo so that I can see the message one as well and message two as well. Now you\nwell and message two as well. Now you\nwell and message two as well. Now you can do it manually as well. It's not\ncan do it manually as well. It's not\ncan do it manually as well. It's not rocket science. But Lang graph has\nrocket science. But Lang graph has\nrocket science. But Lang graph has built-in features available, built-in\nbuilt-in features available, built-in\nbuilt-in features available, built-in operators available that you can use\noperators available that you can use\noperators available that you can use within your langraph code so that you do\nwithin your langraph code so that you do\nwithin your langraph code so that you do not need to manually handle this thing.\nnot need to manually handle this thing.\nnot need to manually handle this thing. Simple. Let me show you how you can just\nSimple. Let me show you how you can just\nSimple. Let me show you how you can just do that. So now here what I will do, I\ndo that. So now here what I will do, I\ndo that. So now here what I will do, I will simply write the code for our\nwill simply write the code for our\nwill simply write the code for our messages. Okay. So now what we need to\nmessages. Okay. So now what we need to\nmessages. Okay. So now what we need to do uh achieve first of all I need to\ndo uh achieve first of all I need to\ndo uh achieve first of all I need to just copy this boiler plate code.\njust copy this boiler plate code.\njust copy this boiler plate code. Perfect.\nOkay. So let's run this one first of\nOkay. So let's run this one first of all.\nall.\nall. And let me just run this code. So now I\nAnd let me just run this code. So now I\nAnd let me just run this code. So now I will also explain you one very small\nwill also explain you one very small\nwill also explain you one very small concept but this will just strengthen\nconcept but this will just strengthen\nconcept but this will just strengthen your understanding of how to work with\nyour understanding of how to work with\nyour understanding of how to work with langraph more efficiently. So as you can\nlangraph more efficiently. So as you can\nlangraph more efficiently. So as you can see that I have created this LLM right\nsee that I have created this LLM right\nsee that I have created this LLM right and I can just invoke this LLM like this\nand I can just invoke this LLM like this\nand I can just invoke this LLM like this like this we have just learned about the\nlike this we have just learned about the\nlike this we have just learned about the messages right and I know that this is\nmessages right and I know that this is\nmessages right and I know that this is human message why because I wrote this\nhuman message why because I wrote this\nhuman message why because I wrote this thing how LLM know\nthing how LLM know\nthing how LLM know how does LLM know that this is a human\nhow does LLM know that this is a human\nhow does LLM know that this is a human message do you know how lang chain is\nmessage do you know how lang chain is\nmessage do you know how lang chain is actually doing so much of work or\nactually doing so much of work or\nactually doing so much of work or basically langraph is doing so much of\nbasically langraph is doing so much of\nbasically langraph is doing so much of work for you under the hood\nwork for you under the hood\nwork for you under the hood When you write this thing, Langra will\nWhen you write this thing, Langra will\nWhen you write this thing, Langra will automatically convert this code into\nautomatically convert this code into\nautomatically convert this code into like this. Let's say first of all, let\nlike this. Let's say first of all, let\nlike this. Let's say first of all, let me just bring the messages\nme just bring the messages\nme just bring the messages from\nfrom\nfrom I will need to check the class for it\nI will need to check the class for it\nI will need to check the class for it for messages. Uh let me just grab the\nfor messages. Uh let me just grab the\nfor messages. Uh let me just grab the class for you for messages. Yeah, lang\nclass for you for messages. Yeah, lang\nclass for you for messages. Yeah, lang chain core. Okay, lang chain core dot\nchain core. Okay, lang chain core dot\nchain core. Okay, lang chain core dot messages import system message human\nmessages import system message human\nmessages import system message human message. But we just need human message.\nmessage. But we just need human message.\nmessage. But we just need human message. So it's good. So now do you know what it\nSo it's good. So now do you know what it\nSo it's good. So now do you know what it will do? It will simply use human\nwill do? It will simply use human\nwill do? It will simply use human message like it will wrap it\nmessage like it will wrap it\nmessage like it will wrap it inside human message and then it will\ninside human message and then it will\ninside human message and then it will write content\nwrite content\nwrite content equals to this. Okay,\nequals to this. Okay,\nequals to this. Okay, you do not need to do this thing because\nyou do not need to do this thing because\nyou do not need to do this thing because it is already doing this thing under the\nit is already doing this thing under the\nit is already doing this thing under the hood. But when you'll be just building\nhood. But when you'll be just building\nhood. But when you'll be just building the langraph application, you need to\nthe langraph application, you need to\nthe langraph application, you need to know this thing otherwise you cannot\nknow this thing otherwise you cannot\nknow this thing otherwise you cannot work with messages. Okay. So, if I run\nwork with messages. Okay. So, if I run\nwork with messages. Okay. So, if I run this thing now, it will generate the\nthis thing now, it will generate the\nthis thing now, it will generate the same response. Wow. What is wrong here?\nsame response. Wow. What is wrong here?\nsame response. Wow. What is wrong here? Uh,\nUh,\nUh, must be a prompt. What did we just do?\nmust be a prompt. What did we just do?\nmust be a prompt. What did we just do? Okay. Human message. Uh,\nI think we just need to add list here\nI think we just need to add list here because it always takes the list of\nbecause it always takes the list of\nbecause it always takes the list of messages. So, let me just write like\nmessages. So, let me just write like\nmessages. So, let me just write like this.\nthis.\nthis. It should. Yeah, now it is running. So\nIt should. Yeah, now it is running. So\nIt should. Yeah, now it is running. So it should work fine now. So now we will\nit should work fine now. So now we will\nit should work fine now. So now we will get the same response. Why? Because I am\nget the same response. Why? Because I am\nget the same response. Why? Because I am passing the human message explicitly by\npassing the human message explicitly by\npassing the human message explicitly by myself. And always remember we need to\nmyself. And always remember we need to\nmyself. And always remember we need to just pass the list. Okay.\njust pass the list. Okay.\njust pass the list. Okay. So now what will happen? It will\nSo now what will happen? It will\nSo now what will happen? It will recognize that this is a human message.\nrecognize that this is a human message.\nrecognize that this is a human message. But even when I do not write this, it\nBut even when I do not write this, it\nBut even when I do not write this, it automatically takes that input in the\nautomatically takes that input in the\nautomatically takes that input in the string format and it it will\nstring format and it it will\nstring format and it it will automatically convert it. Simple. Very\nautomatically convert it. Simple. Very\nautomatically convert it. Simple. Very good. You need to remember this thing\ngood. You need to remember this thing\ngood. You need to remember this thing because it is the back one of this\nbecause it is the back one of this\nbecause it is the back one of this current execution. So what I will do\ncurrent execution. So what I will do\ncurrent execution. So what I will do now? I will define my schema. Right?\nnow? I will define my schema. Right?\nnow? I will define my schema. Right? Let's define the schema. Now if you want\nLet's define the schema. Now if you want\nLet's define the schema. Now if you want to define the schema. Do you know what I\nto define the schema. Do you know what I\nto define the schema. Do you know what I will do? I will create two keys. Okay?\nwill do? I will create two keys. Okay?\nwill do? I will create two keys. Okay? Let me just um show you here. I will\nLet me just um show you here. I will\nLet me just um show you here. I will create two keys. And I will not create\ncreate two keys. And I will not create\ncreate two keys. And I will not create input key because input key we already\ninput key because input key we already\ninput key because input key we already know like we do not need to create input\nknow like we do not need to create input\nknow like we do not need to create input key. Why? Because I want to make it more\nkey. Why? Because I want to make it more\nkey. Why? Because I want to make it more complex. I want you to learn. So I will\ncomplex. I want you to learn. So I will\ncomplex. I want you to learn. So I will say messages\nsay messages\nsay messages and then it will be like let's say u\nand then it will be like let's say u\nand then it will be like let's say u manual okay you can say messages one\nmanual okay you can say messages one\nmanual okay you can say messages one messages two or let's say messages\nmessages two or let's say messages\nmessages two or let's say messages manual but for the explanation I can\nmanual but for the explanation I can\nmanual but for the explanation I can simply keep messages okay but in the\nsimply keep messages okay but in the\nsimply keep messages okay but in the practical we will just use um two keys\npractical we will just use um two keys\npractical we will just use um two keys so here what I will do in the messages\nso here what I will do in the messages\nso here what I will do in the messages tab I will write that human message\ntab I will write that human message\ntab I will write that human message you can say messages is equivalent\nAnd something simple. This is my human\nAnd something simple. This is my human message. And you already know that we\nmessage. And you already know that we\nmessage. And you already know that we need to pass this, right? So this will\nneed to pass this, right? So this will\nneed to pass this, right? So this will become my schema, initial schema. Okay,\nbecome my schema, initial schema. Okay,\nbecome my schema, initial schema. Okay, this is my initial schema. Now this same\nthis is my initial schema. Now this same\nthis is my initial schema. Now this same schema will be pass on here. Let's use\nschema will be pass on here. Let's use\nschema will be pass on here. Let's use this one simple. And this same schema\nthis one simple. And this same schema\nthis one simple. And this same schema will be having one more message. Just\nwill be having one more message. Just\nwill be having one more message. Just guess it. What is that? It is\nguess it. What is that? It is\nguess it. What is that? It is it is\nit is\nit is now having one more item in the you can\nnow having one more item in the you can\nnow having one more item in the you can say list. The second message will be AI\nsay list. The second message will be AI\nsay list. The second message will be AI message.\nmessage.\nmessage. Okay. AI message.\nOkay. AI message.\nOkay. AI message. Perfect. And it will write something\nperfect. Now this will be the current\nperfect. Now this will be the current state of the graph. Then this will go to\nstate of the graph. Then this will go to\nstate of the graph. Then this will go to the third node and this third node will\nthe third node and this third node will\nthe third node and this third node will simply append its response as well like\nsimply append its response as well like\nsimply append its response as well like this\nthis\nthis AI message simple\nAI message simple\nAI message simple something.\nsomething.\nsomething. Okay, this is the flow. This is the\nOkay, this is the flow. This is the\nOkay, this is the flow. This is the flow. I hope you make I hope it makes\nflow. I hope you make I hope it makes\nflow. I hope you make I hope it makes sense. Not you make sense. This is the\nsense. Not you make sense. This is the\nsense. Not you make sense. This is the flow. This is the flow. Okay, I know\nflow. This is the flow. Okay, I know\nflow. This is the flow. Okay, I know it's challenging but that's how you\nit's challenging but that's how you\nit's challenging but that's how you learn. Okay, you just need to maybe you\nlearn. Okay, you just need to maybe you\nlearn. Okay, you just need to maybe you might be just re-watching this segment\nmight be just re-watching this segment\nmight be just re-watching this segment of the video multiple times so that you\nof the video multiple times so that you\nof the video multiple times so that you can understand and grasp that knowledge.\ncan understand and grasp that knowledge.\ncan understand and grasp that knowledge. Simple. We also did it when we were\nSimple. We also did it when we were\nSimple. We also did it when we were learning. Okay, so do not feel like why\nlearning. Okay, so do not feel like why\nlearning. Okay, so do not feel like why do we need to rewatch it? So let's say I\ndo we need to rewatch it? So let's say I\ndo we need to rewatch it? So let's say I want to define my schema. Okay. So I'll\nwant to define my schema. Okay. So I'll\nwant to define my schema. Okay. So I'll simply say from and I will be using type\nsimply say from and I will be using type\nsimply say from and I will be using type dict. We do not want pyic just for the\ndict. We do not want pyic just for the\ndict. We do not want pyic just for the simple example. I will say from typing\nsimple example. I will say from typing\nsimple example. I will say from typing import because type dict is like pretty\nimport because type dict is like pretty\nimport because type dict is like pretty much fast. So that is why from typing I\nmuch fast. So that is why from typing I\nmuch fast. So that is why from typing I will import\ntype dict.\ntype dict. Now what is this thing? Oh.\nNow what is this thing? Oh.\nNow what is this thing? Oh. So now I will define the schema. I will\nSo now I will define the schema. I will\nSo now I will define the schema. I will say\nsay\nsay graph schema.\ngraph schema.\ngraph schema. Simple. Very good. And the graph schema\nSimple. Very good. And the graph schema\nSimple. Very good. And the graph schema will look like this. So do you know\nwill look like this. So do you know\nwill look like this. So do you know what? I will create two keys not one.\nwhat? I will create two keys not one.\nwhat? I will create two keys not one. Why? Because see when I can perform this\nWhy? Because see when I can perform this\nWhy? Because see when I can perform this thing this addition of list manually. I\nthing this addition of list manually. I\nthing this addition of list manually. I do not need to rely on uh langraph for\ndo not need to rely on uh langraph for\ndo not need to rely on uh langraph for that. Why? Because see you should rely\nthat. Why? Because see you should rely\nthat. Why? Because see you should rely on langra for the complex things but not\non langra for the complex things but not\non langra for the complex things but not for the basic things\nfor the basic things\nfor the basic things not for the basic things. Simple okay so\nnot for the basic things. Simple okay so\nnot for the basic things. Simple okay so now what I will do I will create one\nnow what I will do I will create one\nnow what I will do I will create one messages because see lesser vendor login\nmessages because see lesser vendor login\nmessages because see lesser vendor login you will be having for application less\nyou will be having for application less\nyou will be having for application less trouble you will see in future. So just\ntrouble you will see in future. So just\ntrouble you will see in future. So just my advice if you want to take it. So I\nmy advice if you want to take it. So I\nmy advice if you want to take it. So I will simply say\nwill simply say\nwill simply say messages which is the key and this will\nmessages which is the key and this will\nmessages which is the key and this will be the manual that I will manage by\nbe the manual that I will manage by\nbe the manual that I will manage by myself because I want to show you both\nmyself because I want to show you both\nmyself because I want to show you both the ways whatever you like take it. So I\nthe ways whatever you like take it. So I\nthe ways whatever you like take it. So I will simply say message manual and the\nwill simply say message manual and the\nwill simply say message manual and the type of this will be list and let me\ntype of this will be list and let me\ntype of this will be list and let me just import list\njust import list\njust import list simple. And there is one more okay one\nsimple. And there is one more okay one\nsimple. And there is one more okay one more message or you can say one more you\nmore message or you can say one more you\nmore message or you can say one more you can say\ncan say\ncan say um type that I will be just using\num type that I will be just using\num type that I will be just using messages auto because this is like\nmessages auto because this is like\nmessages auto because this is like managed by kind of langraph. Okay, kind\nmanaged by kind of langraph. Okay, kind\nmanaged by kind of langraph. Okay, kind of not by lang graph but this is like\nof not by lang graph but this is like\nof not by lang graph but this is like automated way not like traditional way\nautomated way not like traditional way\nautomated way not like traditional way of doing it. Okay, so let me show you\nof doing it. Okay, so let me show you\nof doing it. Okay, so let me show you that as well. So you simply need to say\nthat as well. So you simply need to say\nthat as well. So you simply need to say annotated.\nannotated.\nannotated. Let me just bring annotated as well.\nLet me just bring annotated as well.\nLet me just bring annotated as well. annotated and I want to import one more\nannotated and I want to import one more\nannotated and I want to import one more operator from operator\noperator from operator\noperator from operator import add okay so I'll simply say\nimport add okay so I'll simply say\nimport add okay so I'll simply say annotated and then I will simply say\nannotated and then I will simply say\nannotated and then I will simply say list okay list and then add so what does\nlist okay list and then add so what does\nlist okay list and then add so what does it mean it means that I will be creating\nit mean it means that I will be creating\nit mean it means that I will be creating this messages key and in this messages\nthis messages key and in this messages\nthis messages key and in this messages key I will be adding list obviously\nkey I will be adding list obviously\nkey I will be adding list obviously because this is a list type but I will\nbecause this is a list type but I will\nbecause this is a list type but I will also add more list into it more list\nalso add more list into it more list\nalso add more list into it more list make sense? So let's say I want to do\nmake sense? So let's say I want to do\nmake sense? So let's say I want to do anything with this list. It will keep on\nanything with this list. It will keep on\nanything with this list. It will keep on adding those list and don't worry you\nadding those list and don't worry you\nadding those list and don't worry you will actually understand it. It's very\nwill actually understand it. It's very\nwill actually understand it. It's very easy. I like both the ways but I like\neasy. I like both the ways but I like\neasy. I like both the ways but I like manual way better because it promotes\nmanual way better because it promotes\nmanual way better because it promotes readability. It eliminates vendor\nreadability. It eliminates vendor\nreadability. It eliminates vendor lockin. It shows you what you are doing\nlockin. It shows you what you are doing\nlockin. It shows you what you are doing with your application. You need to see\nwith your application. You need to see\nwith your application. You need to see it. Right? So this is the class I have\nit. Right? So this is the class I have\nit. Right? So this is the class I have defined the schema. Perfect. Let's try\ndefined the schema. Perfect. Let's try\ndefined the schema. Perfect. Let's try to build the two nodes. So I will simply\nto build the two nodes. So I will simply\nto build the two nodes.

But obviously we\nhere. Right? Perfect. But obviously we\nhere. Right? Perfect. But obviously we need to make some changes. So now\nneed to make some changes. So now\nneed to make some changes. So now first of all we need to make a major\nfirst of all we need to make a major\nfirst of all we need to make a major change in the code. Perfect. Let me just\nchange in the code. Perfect. Let me just\nchange in the code. Perfect. Let me just remove everything. And let me just\nremove everything. And let me just\nremove everything. And let me just remove everything. Perfect.\nremove everything. Perfect.\nremove everything. Perfect. Simple. So let's talk about this curate\nSimple. So let's talk about this curate\nSimple. So let's talk about this curate post. Now in this curate post I want to\npost. Now in this curate post I want to\npost. Now in this curate post I want to access what\naccess what\naccess what messages\nmessages\nmessages manual and messages auto both obviously\nmanual and messages auto both obviously\nmanual and messages auto both obviously right\nright\nright but under the hood both are same thing\nbut under the hood both are same thing\nbut under the hood both are same thing right okay so now what I will do I will\nright okay so now what I will do I will\nright okay so now what I will do I will simply take the message let's say\nsimply take the message let's say\nsimply take the message let's say messages manual equals to this messages\nmessages manual equals to this messages\nmessages manual equals to this messages auto equals to this now I will send\nauto equals to this now I will send\nauto equals to this now I will send these these two messages to my LLM.\nthese these two messages to my LLM.\nthese these two messages to my LLM. Okay, these two messages to my LLM. And\nOkay, these two messages to my LLM. And\nOkay, these two messages to my LLM. And let me do one thing because you will be\nlet me do one thing because you will be\nlet me do one thing because you will be very very confused. Let me just comment\nvery very confused. Let me just comment\nvery very confused. Let me just comment it out the automatic automated way.\nit out the automatic automated way.\nit out the automatic automated way. Let's use this first like messages.\nLet's use this first like messages.\nLet's use this first like messages. Okay, let's learn step by step because\nOkay, let's learn step by step because\nOkay, let's learn step by step because it will be very confusing for you. I\nit will be very confusing for you. I\nit will be very confusing for you. I know this. So let's say we have messages\nknow this. So let's say we have messages\nknow this. So let's say we have messages manual. Yeah, let's talk about it. So we\nmanual. Yeah, let's talk about it. So we\nmanual. Yeah, let's talk about it. So we have messages key and in this messages\nhave messages key and in this messages\nhave messages key and in this messages key, I am storing only and only the\nkey, I am storing only and only the\nkey, I am storing only and only the human message. Simple. And it will be\nhuman message. Simple. And it will be\nhuman message. Simple. And it will be like this in this form. In this form\nlike this in this form. In this form\nlike this in this form. In this form simple so what I need to do I simply\nsimple so what I need to do I simply\nsimple so what I need to do I simply need to send this entire list right this\nneed to send this entire list right this\nneed to send this entire list right this entire list to my llm. Perfect. So let\nentire list to my llm. Perfect. So let\nentire list to my llm. Perfect. So let me just store the response. Let me just\nme just store the response. Let me just\nme just store the response. Let me just say response manual equest lm.invoke and\nsay response manual equest lm.invoke and\nsay response manual equest lm.invoke and messages manual. Now I do not need to\nmessages manual. Now I do not need to\nmessages manual. Now I do not need to get the content. I need to get the whole\nget the content. I need to get the whole\nget the content. I need to get the whole response. Why? Let me just show you that\nresponse. Why? Let me just show you that\nresponse. Why? Let me just show you that as well. If I just remove this dot\nas well. If I just remove this dot\nas well. If I just remove this dot content,\ncontent,\ncontent, you will see the message in the form of\nyou will see the message in the form of\nyou will see the message in the form of AI message. And this time I want that.\nAI message. And this time I want that.\nAI message. And this time I want that. Make sense? I want that. See AI message\nMake sense? I want that. See AI message\nMake sense? I want that. See AI message content. Do you mean this is this? I\ncontent. Do you mean this is this? I\ncontent. Do you mean this is this? I want this thing because this is a\nwant this thing because this is a\nwant this thing because this is a distinguisher between my message and AI\ndistinguisher between my message and AI\ndistinguisher between my message and AI message. And when I have a list of\nmessage. And when I have a list of\nmessage. And when I have a list of messages, I need that distinguisher that\nmessages, I need that distinguisher that\nmessages, I need that distinguisher that will tell, hey, this is your message,\nwill tell, hey, this is your message,\nwill tell, hey, this is your message, this is that message, this is your\nthis is that message, this is your\nthis is that message, this is your message, this is that message. But here\nmessage, this is that message. But here\nmessage, this is that message. But here comes the ideology of you can say\ncomes the ideology of you can say\ncomes the ideology of you can say businessman. So now the person will say\nbusinessman. So now the person will say\nbusinessman. So now the person will say okay I know that this distinguisher is\nokay I know that this distinguisher is\nokay I know that this distinguisher is very important but why do I need to\nvery important but why do I need to\nvery important but why do I need to spend more tokens because after the\nspend more tokens because after the\nspend more tokens because after the content\ncontent\ncontent why do I need to send this information\nwhy do I need to send this information\nwhy do I need to send this information to my LLM? What is the use of it? I do\nto my LLM? What is the use of it? I do\nto my LLM? What is the use of it? I do not need to spend my tokens on this\nnot need to spend my tokens on this\nnot need to spend my tokens on this information and there are so many tokens\ninformation and there are so many tokens\ninformation and there are so many tokens will be wasted on this particular\nwill be wasted on this particular\nwill be wasted on this particular information. Makes sense. You are\ninformation. Makes sense. You are\ninformation. Makes sense. You are absolutely right. So I am not denying on\nabsolutely right. So I am not denying on\nabsolutely right. So I am not denying on that fact. Okay. And I know your money\nthat fact. Okay. And I know your money\nthat fact. Okay. And I know your money is very very precious. So what we can\nis very very precious. So what we can\nis very very precious. So what we can do? We can smartly play around with it.\ndo? We can smartly play around with it.\ndo? We can smartly play around with it. So what I will do? I will simply fetch\nSo what I will do? I will simply fetch\nSo what I will do? I will simply fetch the content\nthe content\nthe content like this. Okay. So I will simply fetch\nlike this. Okay. So I will simply fetch\nlike this. Okay. So I will simply fetch the content like this. That's a dot\nthe content like this. That's a dot\nthe content like this. That's a dot content. But what I will do now I will\ncontent. But what I will do now I will\ncontent. But what I will do now I will simply say\nsimply say\nsimply say response manual AI equals I will wrap\nresponse manual AI equals I will wrap\nresponse manual AI equals I will wrap the content of the AI message into AI\nthe content of the AI message into AI\nthe content of the AI message into AI message object. Okay. So let me just\nmessage object. Okay. So let me just\nmessage object. Okay. So let me just import the AI message\nimport the AI message\nimport the AI message from langchain core dot messages. import\nfrom langchain core dot messages. import\nfrom langchain core dot messages. import AI message. Simple. Now I will play\nAI message. Simple. Now I will play\nAI message. Simple. Now I will play smart. I will simply say AI message and\nsmart. I will simply say AI message and\nsmart. I will simply say AI message and content equals to response manual. Boom.\ncontent equals to response manual. Boom.\ncontent equals to response manual. Boom. Now this has become the AI message\nNow this has become the AI message\nNow this has become the AI message object and we do not have any kind of\nobject and we do not have any kind of\nobject and we do not have any kind of metadata. So our tokens will not be\nmetadata. So our tokens will not be\nmetadata. So our tokens will not be wasted and in this particular error we\nwasted and in this particular error we\nwasted and in this particular error we have to save the tokens as much as we\nhave to save the tokens as much as we\nhave to save the tokens as much as we can. So this is my response simple. Now\ncan. So this is my response simple. Now\ncan. So this is my response simple. Now what we need to do the major thing now\nwhat we need to do the major thing now\nwhat we need to do the major thing now we need to append append this\nwe need to append append this\nwe need to append append this information in our list. Now there are\ninformation in our list. Now there are\ninformation in our list. Now there are two ways you would have like learned\ntwo ways you would have like learned\ntwo ways you would have like learned about the append function in list. You\nabout the append function in list. You\nabout the append function in list. You can simply say state of messages\ncan simply say state of messages\ncan simply say state of messages manual.append which is like coming on\nmanual.append which is like coming on\nmanual.append which is like coming on the screen right now as well. You can\nthe screen right now as well. You can\nthe screen right now as well. You can either use this which is a very basic\neither use this which is a very basic\neither use this which is a very basic one or you can what you can do you can\none or you can what you can do you can\none or you can what you can do you can simply say state of\nsimply say state of\nsimply say state of messages manual. Okay.\nmessages manual. Okay.\nmessages manual. Okay. Equals.\nEquals.\nEquals. Equals\nEquals\nEquals messages manual. Okay. The previous one.\nmessages manual. Okay. The previous one.\nmessages manual. Okay. The previous one. Okay. Like this. So I know this is a\nOkay. Like this. So I know this is a\nOkay. Like this. So I know this is a list. Obviously this is a list, right?\nlist. Obviously this is a list, right?\nlist. Obviously this is a list, right? We have defined the schema. See this is\nWe have defined the schema. See this is\nWe have defined the schema. See this is a list and I can add the new list which\na list and I can add the new list which\na list and I can add the new list which is this one. This is a more professional\nis this one. This is a more professional\nis this one. This is a more professional way to write this thing. But both the\nway to write this thing. But both the\nway to write this thing. But both the methods are correct. You can just use\nmethods are correct. You can just use\nmethods are correct. You can just use any method. Simple. So what I have done\nany method. Simple. So what I have done\nany method. Simple. So what I have done I have added two lists\nI have added two lists\nI have added two lists one and second first is already a list\none and second first is already a list\none and second first is already a list so I do not need to use the square\nso I do not need to use the square\nso I do not need to use the square brackets response manual AI is not a\nbrackets response manual AI is not a\nbrackets response manual AI is not a list it's just a response so that's why\nlist it's just a response so that's why\nlist it's just a response so that's why I have to use these square brackets now\nI have to use these square brackets now\nI have to use these square brackets now I'm simply combining both list to create\nI'm simply combining both list to create\nI'm simply combining both list to create one complete list simple these are very\none complete list simple these are very\none complete list simple these are very fundamental things of Python I'm just\nfundamental things of Python I'm just\nfundamental things of Python I'm just explaining this thing in very much\nexplaining this thing in very much\nexplaining this thing in very much detail so\ndetail so\ndetail so so this is your date, right? So, this\nso this is your date, right? So, this\nso this is your date, right? So, this has become this particular thing. Now,\nhas become this particular thing. Now,\nhas become this particular thing. Now, what will happen? This information will\nwhat will happen? This information will\nwhat will happen? This information will go to the second node curate post.\ngo to the second node curate post.\ngo to the second node curate post. Simple. So, now what we need what you\nSimple. So, now what we need what you\nSimple. So, now what we need what you need to do, you need to first of all\nneed to do, you need to first of all\nneed to do, you need to first of all fetch the current state of messages\nfetch the current state of messages\nfetch the current state of messages manual. Simple. Now, this current state\nmanual. Simple. Now, this current state\nmanual. Simple. Now, this current state is having both the information\nis having both the information\nis having both the information my message, human message and AI message\nmy message, human message and AI message\nmy message, human message and AI message as well. Really? Yes. It has both the\nas well. Really? Yes. It has both the\nas well. Really? Yes. It has both the information.\ninformation.\ninformation. Okay. So now what I will do I will make\nOkay. So now what I will do I will make\nOkay. So now what I will do I will make the API call. Okay, response manual\nthe API call. Okay, response manual\nthe API call. Okay, response manual equals to this and do the same thing\nequals to this and do the same thing\nequals to this and do the same thing that I have done here. And I will simply\nthat I have done here. And I will simply\nthat I have done here. And I will simply append or basically add the this third\nappend or basically add the this third\nappend or basically add the this third response into the list. Perfect. That's\nresponse into the list. Perfect. That's\nresponse into the list. Perfect. That's everything you need to do. Yes, that's\neverything you need to do. Yes, that's\neverything you need to do. Yes, that's everything you need to do. That's it.\neverything you need to do. That's it.\neverything you need to do. That's it. Now we will simply copy and paste the\nNow we will simply copy and paste the\nNow we will simply copy and paste the code from here just to create the graph\ncode from here just to create the graph\ncode from here just to create the graph because all the node names edges name\nbecause all the node names edges name\nbecause all the node names edges name are same, right? So I can simply paste\nare same, right? So I can simply paste\nare same, right? So I can simply paste it here and I can simply show you the\nit here and I can simply show you the\nit here and I can simply show you the result. Create post is not defined\nresult. Create post is not defined\nresult. Create post is not defined because we didn't run this function.\nbecause we didn't run this function.\nbecause we didn't run this function. Perfect. Now let's run this. Perfect.\nPerfect. Now let's run this. Perfect.\nPerfect. Now let's run this. Perfect. Our graph is ready. Now let me just show\nOur graph is ready. Now let me just show\nOur graph is ready. Now let me just show you the invocation which is the major\nyou the invocation which is the major\nyou the invocation which is the major part. Now do you know what? We do not\npart. Now do you know what? We do not\npart. Now do you know what? We do not invoke it like normally. Now we have to\ninvoke it like normally. Now we have to\ninvoke it like normally. Now we have to invoke our graph which is graph pentic\ninvoke our graph which is graph pentic\ninvoke our graph which is graph pentic graph. And let me just rename it. Why do\ngraph. And let me just rename it. Why do\ngraph. And let me just rename it. Why do call it as pentic graph? Let's say\ncall it as pentic graph? Let's say\ncall it as pentic graph? Let's say messages graph.\nmessages graph.\nmessages graph. Okay,\nOkay,\nOkay, messages graph. Perfect. So I will\nmessages graph. Perfect. So I will\nmessages graph. Perfect. So I will simply say\nsimply say\nsimply say messages graph dot invoke. Now while\nmessages graph dot invoke. Now while\nmessages graph dot invoke. Now while invoking it, I have to pass the list of\ninvoking it, I have to pass the list of\ninvoking it, I have to pass the list of message list of messages. So I will pass\nmessage list of messages. So I will pass\nmessage list of messages. So I will pass my schema like this. Messages manual\nmy schema like this. Messages manual\nmy schema like this. Messages manual human message content equals to whatever\nhuman message content equals to whatever\nhuman message content equals to whatever you want to pass. And this time you\nyou want to pass. And this time you\nyou want to pass. And this time you cannot just pass any kind of you can say\ncannot just pass any kind of you can say\ncannot just pass any kind of you can say text. You can pass text because it will\ntext. You can pass text because it will\ntext. You can pass text because it will perform all of the things behind the\nperform all of the things behind the\nperform all of the things behind the scenes. You can but my recommendation\nscenes. You can but my recommendation\nscenes. You can but my recommendation will be simply pass the list. It\nwill be simply pass the list. It\nwill be simply pass the list. It promotes readability. Simple. Very good.\npromotes readability. Simple. Very good.\npromotes readability. Simple. Very good. Let's see the response. Wow. Uh dict\nLet's see the response. Wow. Uh dict\nLet's see the response. Wow. Uh dict object has no attribute model dump. Oh\nobject has no attribute model dump. Oh\nobject has no attribute model dump. Oh yeah because we are not using pyic.

So that's why it is saying why are you\nthat's why it is saying why are you\nthat's why it is saying why are you using model dump? Okay. Let me just\nusing model dump? Okay. Let me just\nusing model dump? Okay. Let me just remove it. No worries. It will make our\nremove it. No worries. It will make our\nremove it. No worries. It will make our code more simpler.\ncode more simpler.\ncode more simpler. Let me just remove it. Perfect.\nLet me just remove it. Perfect.\nLet me just remove it. Perfect. So, let me just run it for one more time\nSo, let me just run it for one more time\nSo, let me just run it for one more time and let's see the response. This time\nand let's see the response. This time\nand let's see the response. This time you will see the messages key will have\nyou will see the messages key will have\nyou will see the messages key will have a list of all the messages. Entire\na list of all the messages. Entire\na list of all the messages. Entire history of the messages is there. Entire\nhistory of the messages is there. Entire\nhistory of the messages is there. Entire history. Just wait.\nhistory. Just wait.\nhistory. Just wait. Just wait.\nAnd this is the advantage of using\nAnd this is the advantage of using langraph storing entire history. Simple.\nlangraph storing entire history. Simple.\nlangraph storing entire history. Simple. Okay. So now our response is ready. And\nOkay. So now our response is ready. And\nOkay. So now our response is ready. And as you can see human message, AI message\nas you can see human message, AI message\nas you can see human message, AI message and AI message. Wow,\nand AI message. Wow,\nand AI message. Wow, this is amazing. As you can see, this is\nthis is amazing. As you can see, this is\nthis is amazing. As you can see, this is the key. And here we have a list of\nthe key. And here we have a list of\nthe key. And here we have a list of messages. Literally the list of\nmessages. Literally the list of\nmessages. Literally the list of messages. See,\nmessages. See,\nmessages. See, that's how you can just perform this\nthat's how you can just perform this\nthat's how you can just perform this thing. Makes sense. You can also like\nthing. Makes sense. You can also like\nthing. Makes sense. You can also like use a pretty print. Okay, just to\nuse a pretty print. Okay, just to\nuse a pretty print. Okay, just to using pretty print\nusing pretty print\nusing pretty print to display the messages in more readable\nto display the messages in more readable\nto display the messages in more readable format. So there's a module called\nformat. So there's a module called\nformat. So there's a module called import pint. Okay. And now let me just\nimport pint. Okay. And now let me just\nimport pint. Okay. And now let me just invoke it for one more time using this\ninvoke it for one more time using this\ninvoke it for one more time using this method. So here you will see the output\nmethod. So here you will see the output\nmethod. So here you will see the output in much more readable format. It is also\nin much more readable format. It is also\nin much more readable format. It is also readable but it's not that much\nreadable but it's not that much\nreadable but it's not that much readable. So what it will do? it will\nreadable. So what it will do? it will\nreadable. So what it will do? it will simply print the message one by one.\nsimply print the message one by one.\nsimply print the message one by one. Okay, it's called pretty print. Very\nOkay, it's called pretty print. Very\nOkay, it's called pretty print. Very similar to pretty print in JSON. So\nsimilar to pretty print in JSON. So\nsimilar to pretty print in JSON. So that's how we can just optimize it. So\nthat's how we can just optimize it. So\nthat's how we can just optimize it. So let's wait for it to return the result.\nlet's wait for it to return the result.\nlet's wait for it to return the result. But now you can see the intent behind\nBut now you can see the intent behind\nBut now you can see the intent behind like what exactly we are trying to do,\nlike what exactly we are trying to do,\nlike what exactly we are trying to do, right? We are storing the entire history\nright? We are storing the entire history\nright? We are storing the entire history of our chat in the what is this man? It\nof our chat in the what is this man? It\nof our chat in the what is this man? It has not applied the pretty print.\nhas not applied the pretty print.\nhas not applied the pretty print. Oh, because it has simply performed the\nOh, because it has simply performed the\nOh, because it has simply performed the pretty print only on the JSON format but\npretty print only on the JSON format but\npretty print only on the JSON format but not on the list. Okay, that's fine. We\nnot on the list. Okay, that's fine. We\nnot on the list. Okay, that's fine. We can just use stream method as well to do\ncan just use stream method as well to do\ncan just use stream method as well to do that. But I don't want to include\nthat. But I don't want to include\nthat. But I don't want to include unnecessary keywords right now. You'll\nunnecessary keywords right now. You'll\nunnecessary keywords right now. You'll be confused. So let's stick with the\nbe confused. So let's stick with the\nbe confused. So let's stick with the basic one. Let's learn step by step. So\nbasic one. Let's learn step by step. So\nbasic one. Let's learn step by step. So this is the entire history right see now\nthis is the entire history right see now\nthis is the entire history right see now I can see the first message my message.\nI can see the first message my message.\nI can see the first message my message. Now I can see the nodes message which is\nNow I can see the nodes message which is\nNow I can see the nodes message which is node one and I can also see the second\nnode one and I can also see the second\nnode one and I can also see the second node message in exactly same thing that\nnode message in exactly same thing that\nnode message in exactly same thing that we have discussed here. See,\nwe have discussed here. See,\nwe have discussed here. See, wow. Now I will just show you the\nwow. Now I will just show you the\nwow. Now I will just show you the built-in method as well.

So if I just\ncombine it automatically. So if I just\ncombine it automatically. So if I just unccomment this thing now. Okay. Now I\nunccomment this thing now. Okay. Now I\nunccomment this thing now. Okay. Now I will perform the same thing here as well\nwill perform the same thing here as well\nwill perform the same thing here as well for my messages auto. So I will simply\nfor my messages auto. So I will simply\nfor my messages auto. So I will simply say let me first of all run this perfect\nsay let me first of all run this perfect\nsay let me first of all run this perfect and it will become my messages auto\nand it will become my messages auto\nand it will become my messages auto messages\nmessages\nmessages auto and this is the you can say\nauto and this is the you can say\nauto and this is the you can say fetching the details and then same thing\nfetching the details and then same thing\nfetching the details and then same thing will happen response auto\nwill happen response auto\nwill happen response auto response auto equals to this one. Okay.\nresponse auto equals to this one. Okay.\nresponse auto equals to this one. Okay. And we want to do this. Now the only\nAnd we want to do this. Now the only\nAnd we want to do this.

It simply updates it. But\noverrides it. It simply updates it. But\noverrides it. It simply updates it. But here when we use reducer like this\nhere when we use reducer like this\nhere when we use reducer like this reducer let me just write\nreducer let me just write\nreducer let me just write using\nusing\nusing reducer in lang graph\nthen it will not update it. It will\nthen it will not update it. It will simply automatically add this list into\nsimply automatically add this list into\nsimply automatically add this list into the existing message key. Wow.\nthe existing message key. Wow.\nthe existing message key. Wow. Yes, it is wow. But I am not a big fan\nYes, it is wow. But I am not a big fan\nYes, it is wow. But I am not a big fan of it because it reduces the readability\nof it because it reduces the readability\nof it because it reduces the readability because you can be confused. Hey, I am\nbecause you can be confused. Hey, I am\nbecause you can be confused.

It says okay we are simply updating the key which is the\nare simply updating the key which is the\nare simply updating the key which is the fundamental thing and we are updating it\nfundamental thing and we are updating it\nfundamental thing and we are updating it with the previous message and this new\nwith the previous message and this new\nwith the previous message and this new list. So everyone has its own way of\nlist. So everyone has its own way of\nlist. So everyone has its own way of writing the code. I like manual thing.\nwriting the code. I like manual thing.\nwriting the code. I like manual thing. You can just use the automated way. I\nYou can just use the automated way. I\nYou can just use the automated way. I have just showed both the ways. Second\nhave just showed both the ways. Second\nhave just showed both the ways. Second it's all about reducers as well. You\nit's all about reducers as well. You\nit's all about reducers as well. You also need to know the reducers in\nalso need to know the reducers in\nalso need to know the reducers in langraph. Now you know the reducers as\nlangraph. Now you know the reducers as\nlangraph. Now you know the reducers as well. So I can do the same thing here as\nwell. So I can do the same thing here as\nwell. So I can do the same thing here as well, right?\nLet's say like this\nLet's say like this simple now if I say run all now what\nsimple now if I say run all now what\nsimple now if I say run all now what should I see I should see two keys okay\nshould I see I should see two keys okay\nshould I see I should see two keys okay one is manual one is automated but now\none is manual one is automated but now\none is manual one is automated but now you know what exactly we trying we are\nyou know what exactly we trying we are\nyou know what exactly we trying we are trying to do so I like this particular\ntrying to do so I like this particular\ntrying to do so I like this particular method oh I need to pass this thing okay\nmethod oh I need to pass this thing okay\nmethod oh I need to pass this thing okay this will I think so see there's a like\nthis will I think so see there's a like\nthis will I think so see there's a like very good um you can say test as well\nvery good um you can say test as well\nvery good um you can say test as well for typed dict here I have not passed\nfor typed dict here I have not passed\nfor typed dict here I have not passed the second key. Okay, I have not passed\nthe second key. Okay, I have not passed\nthe second key. Okay, I have not passed the second key. But still it will throw\nthe second key. But still it will throw\nthe second key. But still it will throw the error even if it is not pidentical.\nthe error even if it is not pidentical.\nthe error even if it is not pidentical. Why? Because this is not due to the\nWhy? Because this is not due to the\nWhy? Because this is not due to the schema failure. Not at all. It is due to\nschema failure. Not at all. It is due to\nschema failure. Not at all. It is due to because the subsequent nodes are using\nbecause the subsequent nodes are using\nbecause the subsequent nodes are using that particular key. So it will simply\nthat particular key. So it will simply\nthat particular key. So it will simply say hey this is empty. Make sense? So I\nsay hey this is empty. Make sense? So I\nsay hey this is empty. Make sense? So I can simply say\ncan simply say\ncan simply say the\nthe\nthe messages auto is this one. Simple. Let\nmessages auto is this one. Simple. Let\nmessages auto is this one. Simple. Let me just now run this thing.\nme just now run this thing.\nme just now run this thing. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. So now you will see two things and now\nSo now you will see two things and now\nSo now you will see two things and now it's like very very easy. So that's how\nit's like very very easy. So that's how\nit's like very very easy. So that's how you work with reducers in langraph in\nyou work with reducers in langraph in\nyou work with reducers in langraph in your state graph. Whatever you want to\nyour state graph. Whatever you want to\nyour state graph. Whatever you want to say make sense. Okay. So now we'll be\nsay make sense. Okay. So now we'll be\nsay make sense. Okay. So now we'll be learning about a very quick and very\nlearning about a very quick and very\nlearning about a very quick and very important topic which is prompts. And\nimportant topic which is prompts. And\nimportant topic which is prompts. And let's wait for a few more seconds just\nlet's wait for a few more seconds just\nlet's wait for a few more seconds just to\nto\nto complete it. Uh it took 30 seconds. So\ncomplete it. Uh it took 30 seconds. So\ncomplete it. Uh it took 30 seconds. So wow man.\nwow man.\nwow man. Usually they do not take this long. Uh\nUsually they do not take this long. Uh\nUsually they do not take this long. Uh let me be honest. Okay. So I don't know\nlet me be honest. Okay. So I don't know\nlet me be honest. Okay. So I don't know like why today it is taking so long.\nlike why today it is taking so long.\nlike why today it is taking so long. Maybe the model is not good enough. I\nMaybe the model is not good enough. I\nMaybe the model is not good enough. I can use some other models as well. Or\ncan use some other models as well. Or\ncan use some other models as well. Or maybe their servers are down because we\nmaybe their servers are down because we\nmaybe their servers are down because we all know what's going on with OpenAI.\nall know what's going on with OpenAI.\nall know what's going on with OpenAI. But this is a paid model. Okay. This is\nBut this is a paid model. Okay. This is\nBut this is a paid model. Okay. This is not a free model.\nnot a free model.\nnot a free model. So Oh man, it's over 1 minute. Are you\nSo Oh man, it's over 1 minute. Are you\nSo Oh man, it's over 1 minute. Are you serious? Are you serious?\nserious? Are you serious?\nserious? Are you serious? Yeah, it is what it is. Yeah, but we\nYeah, it is what it is. Yeah, but we\nYeah, it is what it is. Yeah, but we know like what will be the output of it.\nknow like what will be the output of it.\nknow like what will be the output of it. And I can just show you the output.\nAnd I can just show you the output.\nAnd I can just show you the output. Yeah, it's done finally. So, both will\nYeah, it's done finally. So, both will\nYeah, it's done finally. So, both will have the same output. Nothing surprise\nhave the same output. Nothing surprise\nhave the same output. Nothing surprise uh surprising here. But yeah, you know,\nuh surprising here. But yeah, you know,\nuh surprising here. But yeah, you know, both will just generate you can say the\nboth will just generate you can say the\nboth will just generate you can say the same thing. But here the thing is one is\nsame thing. But here the thing is one is\nsame thing. But here the thing is one is manual way, second is automated way. But\nmanual way, second is automated way. But\nmanual way, second is automated way. But now you know both the ways. Simple. Very\nnow you know both the ways. Simple. Very\nnow you know both the ways. Simple. Very good. Now let's talk about the concept\ngood. Now let's talk about the concept\ngood. Now let's talk about the concept called prompts.\ncalled prompts.\ncalled prompts. What are prompts?\nWhat are prompts?\nWhat are prompts? If you are coming from lang chain,\nIf you are coming from lang chain,\nIf you are coming from lang chain, you already know about prompts. If you\nyou already know about prompts. If you\nyou already know about prompts. If you are new in the world of lang chain or if\nare new in the world of lang chain or if\nare new in the world of lang chain or if you haven't worked with prompts, let me\nyou haven't worked with prompts, let me\nyou haven't worked with prompts, let me just tell you. So whenever we want to\njust tell you. So whenever we want to\njust tell you. So whenever we want to pass anything to LLM, let's say\npass anything to LLM, let's say\npass anything to LLM, let's say this is you and you want to pass\nthis is you and you want to pass\nthis is you and you want to pass anything in to the LLM. Usually\nanything in to the LLM. Usually\nanything in to the LLM. Usually just for the quick prototyping you\njust for the quick prototyping you\njust for the quick prototyping you directly pass the input like this right\ndirectly pass the input like this right\ndirectly pass the input like this right directly input hey what is this what is\ndirectly input hey what is this what is\ndirectly input hey what is this what is that blah blah blah but it is always a\nthat blah blah blah but it is always a\nthat blah blah blah but it is always a good practice that we always pass\ngood practice that we always pass\ngood practice that we always pass the\nthe\nthe prompt.\nprompt.\nprompt. Okay, we always pass the prompt\nOkay, we always pass the prompt\nOkay, we always pass the prompt and we use the chat prompt template to\nand we use the chat prompt template to\nand we use the chat prompt template to pass the prompts to our chat models.\npass the prompts to our chat models.\npass the prompts to our chat models. Okay. Okay. Prompts are basically you\nOkay. Okay. Prompts are basically you\nOkay. Okay. Prompts are basically you can say templates which are already\ncan say templates which are already\ncan say templates which are already there for us that we can just use and we\nthere for us that we can just use and we\nthere for us that we can just use and we can fill our values. What is the benefit\ncan fill our values. What is the benefit\ncan fill our values. What is the benefit of it? No benefit. Then why are we\nof it? No benefit. Then why are we\nof it? No benefit. Then why are we learning? See no benefit in terms of\nlearning? See no benefit in terms of\nlearning? See no benefit in terms of processing. No benefit in terms of you\nprocessing. No benefit in terms of you\nprocessing. No benefit in terms of you can say speed, efficiency, but a lot of\ncan say speed, efficiency, but a lot of\ncan say speed, efficiency, but a lot of benefits in terms of you can say\nbenefits in terms of you can say\nbenefits in terms of you can say building reliable code.\nbuilding reliable code.\nbuilding reliable code. Make sense? You should always pass the\nMake sense? You should always pass the\nMake sense? You should always pass the prompt to the LLM. Okay. So, let me just\nprompt to the LLM. Okay. So, let me just\nprompt to the LLM. Okay. So, let me just write here. It should always be a\nwrite here. It should always be a\nwrite here. It should always be a prompt. And where is my prompt? Do I\nprompt. And where is my prompt? Do I\nprompt. And where is my prompt? Do I have any prompt? Let's say this is a\nhave any prompt? Let's say this is a\nhave any prompt? Let's say this is a prompt. No, this is not a prompt.\nprompt. No, this is not a prompt.\nprompt. No, this is not a prompt. Let's say\nLet's say\nLet's say this is a prompt.\nthis is a prompt.\nthis is a prompt. Okay,\nthis is a prompt. You should always pass\nthis is a prompt. You should always pass a prompt. H. Now let me show you the\na prompt. H. Now let me show you the\na prompt. H. Now let me show you the chat prompt template library in\nchat prompt template library in\nchat prompt template library in Langchain because templates, prompts,\nLangchain because templates, prompts,\nLangchain because templates, prompts, messages are all the part of Langchain\nmessages are all the part of Langchain\nmessages are all the part of Langchain library. But we just import it in\nlibrary. But we just import it in\nlibrary. But we just import it in langraph because lang graph people are\nlangraph because lang graph people are\nlangraph because lang graph people are not very very free to rebuild the same\nnot very very free to rebuild the same\nnot very very free to rebuild the same stuff in langraph. So simply say they\nstuff in langraph. So simply say they\nstuff in langraph. So simply say they simply say import it simple. So I will\nsimply say import it simple. So I will\nsimply say import it simple. So I will say chat prompt template lang simple.\nsay chat prompt template lang simple.\nsay chat prompt template lang simple. Let's see about let's let's see. So\nLet's see about let's let's see. So\nLet's see about let's let's see. So here's a class\nhere's a class\nhere's a class class chat prompt template. Perfect. So\nclass chat prompt template. Perfect. So\nclass chat prompt template. Perfect. So here this is the code about it and you\nhere this is the code about it and you\nhere this is the code about it and you do not need to worry about code because\ndo not need to worry about code because\ndo not need to worry about code because I will explain you everything. Okay. You\nI will explain you everything. Okay. You\nI will explain you everything. Okay. You just need to know about this class. So\njust need to know about this class. So\njust need to know about this class. So this class is available in lang chain\nthis class is available in lang chain\nthis class is available in lang chain core.prompts. Okay. And then you need to\ncore.prompts. Okay. And then you need to\ncore.prompts. Okay. And then you need to import the chat prompt template and\nimport the chat prompt template and\nimport the chat prompt template and that's it. Simple.\nthat's it. Simple.\nthat's it. Simple. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. That is it. You just need to know about\nThat is it. You just need to know about\nThat is it. You just need to know about this thing. Okay. And then let me just\nthis thing. Okay.

Let me just explain you in my\nreally. Let me just explain you in my\nreally. Let me just explain you in my notebook. So let's talk about that thing\nnotebook. So let's talk about that thing\nnotebook. So let's talk about that thing prompts.\nprompts do ipynb.\nprompts do ipynb. If we just talk about prompts\nsimple\nsimple uh wow thank you for writing it.\nuh wow thank you for writing it.\nuh wow thank you for writing it. So let me just import my boilerplate\nSo let me just import my boilerplate\nSo let me just import my boilerplate code. I could have just like I can also\ncode. I could have just like I can also\ncode. I could have just like I can also built a utility that I can just import a\nbuilt a utility that I can just import a\nbuilt a utility that I can just import a kind of function but it's fine because I\nkind of function but it's fine because I\nkind of function but it's fine because I want you to run independent notebooks as\nwant you to run independent notebooks as\nwant you to run independent notebooks as well without utilities. So perfect\nwhat is this man? What is this?\nwhat is this man? What is this? Oh I didn't select the kernel.\nOh I didn't select the kernel.\nOh I didn't select the kernel. Okay. So now this is my boiler plate\nOkay. So now this is my boiler plate\nOkay. So now this is my boiler plate code and let me just create the\ncode and let me just create the\ncode and let me just create the LLM object as well because that is also\nLLM object as well because that is also\nLLM object as well because that is also required.\nrequired.\nrequired. Perfect. So now I want to send my\nPerfect. So now I want to send my\nPerfect. So now I want to send my information or basically the query to\ninformation or basically the query to\ninformation or basically the query to this LLM. But I want to make the use of\nthis LLM. But I want to make the use of\nthis LLM. But I want to make the use of prompt\nprompt\nprompt right. So how you can just use it? So\nright. So how you can just use it? So\nright. So how you can just use it? So you can simply copy it. First of all,\nyou can simply copy it. First of all,\nyou can simply copy it. First of all, the class that we copied here\nthe class that we copied here\nthe class that we copied here and here I will just paste it. Langchain\nand here I will just paste it.

I need to use comma with\nthe colon. I need to use comma with tuple. We cannot use colon. So this is\ntuple. We cannot use colon. So this is\ntuple. We cannot use colon. So this is my prompt and what is the value of it?\nmy prompt and what is the value of it?\nmy prompt and what is the value of it? Let me show you. If I just print my\nLet me show you. If I just print my\nLet me show you. If I just print my prompt and if I just print it, you will\nprompt and if I just print it, you will\nprompt and if I just print it, you will see this is a kind of chat prompt\nsee this is a kind of chat prompt\nsee this is a kind of chat prompt template which has some information. See\ntemplate which has some information. See\ntemplate which has some information. See messages equals to system message prompt\nmessages equals to system message prompt\nmessages equals to system message prompt template prompt equals to this this this\ntemplate prompt equals to this this this\ntemplate prompt equals to this this this and so many other things. Wow. Do you\nand so many other things. Wow. Do you\nand so many other things. Wow. Do you know what? Now let me show the real\nknow what? Now let me show the real\nknow what? Now let me show the real power of prompt. prompt is actually used\npower of prompt. prompt is actually used\npower of prompt. prompt is actually used for making your code reusable. Let's say\nfor making your code reusable. Let's say\nfor making your code reusable. Let's say here the request is dynamic. Here the\nhere the request is dynamic. Here the\nhere the request is dynamic. Here the person is saying I want to create a post\nperson is saying I want to create a post\nperson is saying I want to create a post about and the person is also typing the\nabout and the person is also typing the\nabout and the person is also typing the value of it. Right? Let's say this topic\nvalue of it. Right? Let's say this topic\nvalue of it. Right? Let's say this topic is dynamic. I can simply say topic\nis dynamic. I can simply say topic\nis dynamic. I can simply say topic simple.\nsimple.\nsimple. Now\nNow\nNow this is a dynamic template because\nthis is a dynamic template because\nthis is a dynamic template because there's a reason behind the name we call\nthere's a reason behind the name we call\nthere's a reason behind the name we call it as a template. Template means like\nit as a template. Template means like\nit as a template. Template means like you can use it with anything. So let's\nyou can use it with anything. So let's\nyou can use it with anything. So let's say I am building one application and I\nsay I am building one application and I\nsay I am building one application and I have this particular template simple.\nVery good. So\nVery good. So now I have this topic right? Now this\nnow I have this topic right? Now this\nnow I have this topic right? Now this topic is dynamic. Now what I will do I\ntopic is dynamic. Now what I will do I\ntopic is dynamic. Now what I will do I can pass the values during invocation of\ncan pass the values during invocation of\ncan pass the values during invocation of this template. I will simply say my\nthis template. I will simply say my\nthis template. I will simply say my prompt dot invoke and I will say topic.\nprompt dot invoke and I will say topic.\nprompt dot invoke and I will say topic. I can pass the topic like this. Wow. Now\nI can pass the topic like this. Wow. Now\nI can pass the topic like this. Wow. Now if I show you the result you will see\nif I show you the result you will see\nif I show you the result you will see the value. You are a helpful assistant\nthe value. You are a helpful assistant\nthe value. You are a helpful assistant that helps to create. This is the system\nthat helps to create. This is the system\nthat helps to create. This is the system message and let's go towards right. It\nmessage and let's go towards right. It\nmessage and let's go towards right. It will say I want to create a post about\nwill say I want to create a post about\nwill say I want to create a post about and it has automatically filled this\nand it has automatically filled this\nand it has automatically filled this information using this invoke method.\ninformation using this invoke method.\ninformation using this invoke method. Wow. See automatically.\nWow. See automatically.\nWow. See automatically. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. And when you pass this information\nAnd when you pass this information\nAnd when you pass this information to LLM, it can automatically process\nto LLM, it can automatically process\nto LLM, it can automatically process this information.\nthis information.\nthis information. Why? Because just look at the object\nWhy? Because just look at the object\nWhy? Because just look at the object carefully what it is typing. See chat\ncarefully what it is typing. See chat\ncarefully what it is typing. See chat prompt template the chat prompt value\nprompt template the chat prompt value\nprompt template the chat prompt value this is fine but messages equals to\nthis is fine but messages equals to\nthis is fine but messages equals to system message is it similar to the\nsystem message is it similar to the\nsystem message is it similar to the thing that we have just seen\nthing that we have just seen\nthing that we have just seen here see\noh yeah so it performs this chat prompt\noh yeah so it performs this chat prompt template performs the same thing under\ntemplate performs the same thing under\ntemplate performs the same thing under the hood so you simply need to use this\nthe hood so you simply need to use this\nthe hood so you simply need to use this syntax to automatically convert this\nsyntax to automatically convert this\nsyntax to automatically convert this thing into this thing dynamically\nthing into this thing dynamically\nthing into this thing dynamically because you can just pass the values\nbecause you can just pass the values\nbecause you can just pass the values during the invocation.\nduring the invocation.\nduring the invocation. Simple. This is very useful. Just\nSimple. This is very useful. Just\nSimple. This is very useful. Just remember it. Make sense? Okay. Now we\nremember it. Make sense? Okay. Now we\nremember it. Make sense? Okay. Now we will just simply learn one basic thing\nwill just simply learn one basic thing\nwill just simply learn one basic thing of lang chain as well. Okay. So this is\nof lang chain as well. Okay. So this is\nof lang chain as well. Okay. So this is my prompt. Let me just save this\nmy prompt. Let me just save this\nmy prompt. Let me just save this response into a variable. Let's say\nresponse into a variable. Let's say\nresponse into a variable. Let's say prompt um invoked or basically you can\nprompt um invoked or basically you can\nprompt um invoked or basically you can say filled.\nsay filled.\nsay filled. Okay. Prompt filled equals to this\nOkay. Prompt filled equals to this\nOkay. Prompt filled equals to this thing. Let's say this was filled. Okay.\nthing. Let's say this was filled. Okay.\nthing. Let's say this was filled. Okay. Let me just run this now. Perfect. Now I\nLet me just run this now. Perfect. Now I\nLet me just run this now. Perfect. Now I want to pass this value, this prompt to\nwant to pass this value, this prompt to\nwant to pass this value, this prompt to my LLM, right? How do I do it? Like how\nmy LLM, right? How do I do it? Like how\nmy LLM, right? How do I do it? Like how do I need to do it? So now I can just do\ndo I need to do it? So now I can just do\ndo I need to do it? So now I can just do llm dot invoke and then I will simply\nllm dot invoke and then I will simply\nllm dot invoke and then I will simply say prompt field, right? And I can\nsay prompt field, right? And I can\nsay prompt field, right? And I can invoke it.\ninvoke it.\ninvoke it. Let's wait.\nLet's wait.\nLet's wait. And it will simply invoke it and it will\nAnd it will simply invoke it and it will\nAnd it will simply invoke it and it will simply generate the response. And\nsimply generate the response. And\nsimply generate the response. And do you know what?\ndo you know what?\ndo you know what? It will automatically parse this\nIt will automatically parse this\nIt will automatically parse this information. Yes. So we have got the\ninformation. Yes. So we have got the\ninformation. Yes. So we have got the response. And one more thing this model\nresponse. And one more thing this model\nresponse. And one more thing this model is taking a lot of time. And let me just\nis taking a lot of time. And let me just\nis taking a lot of time. And let me just change the model. Let me just use 4.1\nchange the model. Let me just use 4.1\nchange the model. Let me just use 4.1 mini or 4.1.\nmini or 4.1.\nmini or 4.1. So oh this is expensive. Uh let's use\nSo oh this is expensive. Uh let's use\nSo oh this is expensive. Uh let's use let's say 4\nlet's say 4\nlet's say 4 mini or 4.1. Let's say\nmini or 4.1. Let's say\nmini or 4.1. Let's say 40 transcribe 40 I think was fast and\n40 transcribe 40 I think was fast and\n40 transcribe 40 I think was fast and what it was. No, it was not cheap. Let\nwhat it was. No, it was not cheap. Let\nwhat it was. No, it was not cheap. Let me just find the quick model. So let's\nme just find the quick model. So let's\nme just find the quick model. So let's use this model 5 mini and I hope this\nuse this model 5 mini and I hope this\nuse this model 5 mini and I hope this will be like much faster. Let's use this\nwill be like much faster. Let's use this\nwill be like much faster. Let's use this one.\none.\none. GBT 5 mini. Okay. So let's run this and\nGBT 5 mini. Okay. So let's run this and\nGBT 5 mini. Okay. So let's run this and let's see the response.\nlet's see the response.\nlet's see the response. llm.invoke\nllm.invoke\nllm.invoke prompt field. Uh let's see not really it\nprompt field. Uh let's see not really it\nprompt field. Uh let's see not really it is also the same open what happened\nis also the same open what happened\nis also the same open what happened what happened bro so now this is the\nwhat happened bro so now this is the\nwhat happened bro so now this is the message now you would have seen that I\nmessage now you would have seen that I\nmessage now you would have seen that I am invoking the same not same thing like\nam invoking the same not same thing like\nam invoking the same not same thing like two different things independently but\ntwo different things independently but\ntwo different things independently but here comes the role of chains in lang\nhere comes the role of chains in lang\nhere comes the role of chains in lang chain okay so what you can do you can\nchain okay so what you can do you can\nchain okay so what you can do you can literally create a chain of these two\nliterally create a chain of these two\nliterally create a chain of these two objects let me just tell you how let me\nobjects let me just tell you how let me\nobjects let me just tell you how let me just remove both the cells Okay,\njust remove both the cells Okay,\njust remove both the cells Okay, perfect. So, one object is lm which is\nperfect. So, one object is lm which is\nperfect. So, one object is lm which is there which I need to invoke. Second\nthere which I need to invoke. Second\nthere which I need to invoke. Second object is this one my prompt which I\nobject is this one my prompt which I\nobject is this one my prompt which I need to invoke. Right now I can create a\nneed to invoke. Right now I can create a\nneed to invoke. Right now I can create a chain. This is called lang chain. So I\nchain. This is called lang chain. So I\nchain. This is called lang chain. So I will simply say\nchain um oh\nchain um oh chain chain of thought chain with prompt\nchain chain of thought chain with prompt\nchain chain of thought chain with prompt simple. Now I will create a chain. Do\nsimple. Now I will create a chain. Do\nsimple. Now I will create a chain. Do you know how to create a chain in lang?\nyou know how to create a chain in lang?\nyou know how to create a chain in lang? It's so simple. Let me show you. So\nIt's so simple. Let me show you. So\nIt's so simple. Let me show you. So let's say chain equals I will first of\nlet's say chain equals I will first of\nlet's say chain equals I will first of all put the prompt because I first need\nall put the prompt because I first need\nall put the prompt because I first need to invoke the prompt. I will simply\nto invoke the prompt. I will simply\nto invoke the prompt. I will simply write my prompt and then I will use uh\nwrite my prompt and then I will use uh\nwrite my prompt and then I will use uh pipe operator like this and then I will\npipe operator like this and then I will\npipe operator like this and then I will put the second object that I need to\nput the second object that I need to\nput the second object that I need to invoke. Now you can treat this thing as\ninvoke. Now you can treat this thing as\ninvoke. Now you can treat this thing as one node and second node. It's not\none node and second node. It's not\none node and second node. It's not actually a node but just for the\nactually a node but just for the\nactually a node but just for the simplicity. And you know what I told you\nsimplicity. And you know what I told you\nsimplicity. And you know what I told you the input of one thing one node will\nthe input of one thing one node will\nthe input of one thing one node will travel to the other thing. So here the\ntravel to the other thing. So here the\ntravel to the other thing. So here the input like output of my prompt will go\ninput like output of my prompt will go\ninput like output of my prompt will go or will travel to the llm as the input.\nor will travel to the llm as the input.\nor will travel to the llm as the input. So now what I will do I will simply\nSo now what I will do I will simply\nSo now what I will do I will simply create this chain and I will simply say\ncreate this chain and I will simply say\ncreate this chain and I will simply say chain dot invoke and I will invoke this\nchain dot invoke and I will invoke this\nchain dot invoke and I will invoke this thing like this. So what will happen?\nthing like this. So what will happen?\nthing like this. So what will happen? What will happen? It will first of all\nWhat will happen? It will first of all\nWhat will happen? It will first of all invoke my prompt right and it it will\ninvoke my prompt right and it it will\ninvoke my prompt right and it it will invoke it with the this topic. Why?\ninvoke it with the this topic. Why?\ninvoke it with the this topic. Why? Because there's a variable here.\nBecause there's a variable here.\nBecause there's a variable here. Perfect. This will generate the entire\nPerfect. This will generate the entire\nPerfect. This will generate the entire field prompt, right? Then that field\nfield prompt, right? Then that field\nfield prompt, right? Then that field prompt will automatically be passed as a\nprompt will automatically be passed as a\nprompt will automatically be passed as a parameter while invoking this LLM.\nparameter while invoking this LLM.\nparameter while invoking this LLM. Wow. This is your lang chain. This is\nWow. This is your lang chain. This is\nWow. This is your lang chain. This is your lang chain. So that's how you work\nyour lang chain. So that's how you work\nyour lang chain. So that's how you work with prompts with lang chain. Simple and\nwith prompts with lang chain. Simple and\nwith prompts with lang chain. Simple and you just need to know this much to just\nyou just need to know this much to just\nyou just need to know this much to just get continued with your future sessions\nget continued with your future sessions\nget continued with your future sessions of lang that we are just going to take.\nof lang that we are just going to take.\nof lang that we are just going to take.

That's your prompts. Let me just rename\nThat's your prompts. Let me just rename\nThat's your prompts. Let me just rename it. Prompts and chains.\nit. Prompts and chains.\nit. Prompts and chains. Simple. Just remember this thing. Now\nSimple. Just remember this thing. Now\nSimple. Just remember this thing. Now let's talk about the tool binding in\nlet's talk about the tool binding in\nlet's talk about the tool binding in langraph. Let's talk about it. Now let's\nlangraph. Let's talk about it. Now let's\nlangraph. Let's talk about it. Now let's start learning about the tools. Because\nstart learning about the tools. Because\nstart learning about the tools. Because nowadays we always hear about we can\nnowadays we always hear about we can\nnowadays we always hear about we can create tools, we can create this, we can\ncreate tools, we can create this, we can\ncreate tools, we can create this, we can create that. But at the end of the day,\ncreate that. But at the end of the day,\ncreate that. But at the end of the day, we need to make the efficient tools so\nwe need to make the efficient tools so\nwe need to make the efficient tools so that we can allow our LLM to make the\nthat we can allow our LLM to make the\nthat we can allow our LLM to make the external API calls. So far, we have just\nexternal API calls. So far, we have just\nexternal API calls. So far, we have just learned that how we can just make simple\nlearned that how we can just make simple\nlearned that how we can just make simple API calls. Right? So for example,\nAPI calls. Right? So for example,\nAPI calls. Right? So for example, I ask a question which my LM cannot\nI ask a question which my LM cannot\nI ask a question which my LM cannot answer. Not because it is not smart\nanswer. Not because it is not smart\nanswer. Not because it is not smart enough because LLM doesn't have any kind\nenough because LLM doesn't have any kind\nenough because LLM doesn't have any kind of context. Right? So for that\nof context. Right? So for that\nof context. Right? So for that particular thing I need to provide that\nparticular thing I need to provide that\nparticular thing I need to provide that particular context. Simple. Okay. Now in\nparticular context. Simple. Okay. Now in\nparticular context. Simple. Okay. Now in langraph how we can just create the\nlangraph how we can just create the\nlangraph how we can just create the tools? It's very simple. Tools are\ntools? It's very simple. Tools are\ntools? It's very simple. Tools are nothing but okay. Tools are nothing but\nnothing but okay. Tools are nothing but\nnothing but okay. Tools are nothing but your Python functions. For example,\nyour Python functions. For example,\nyour Python functions. For example, let's say I will write any kind of\nlet's say I will write any kind of\nlet's say I will write any kind of function. Let's say any function. Simple\nfunction. Let's say any function. Simple\nfunction. Let's say any function. Simple any function. Let's say this is u\nany function. Let's say this is u\nany function. Let's say this is u and you created this\nand you created this\nand you created this function.\nfunction.\nfunction. Simple using exact Python function.\nSimple using exact Python function.\nSimple using exact Python function. Using exact Python function. Okay.\nUsing exact Python function. Okay.\nUsing exact Python function. Okay. Simple. Now\nSimple. Now\nSimple. Now what you can do? You can convert this\nwhat you can do? You can convert this\nwhat you can do? You can convert this function into a tool by just applying a\nfunction into a tool by just applying a\nfunction into a tool by just applying a wrapper. What? Applying a wrapper. This\nwrapper. What? Applying a wrapper. This\nwrapper. What? Applying a wrapper. This wrapper is called tool.\nwrapper is called tool.\nwrapper is called tool. That's it. This wrapper is called tool.\nThat's it. This wrapper is called tool.\nThat's it. This wrapper is called tool. So let's say this is your entire\nSo let's say this is your entire\nSo let's say this is your entire function. The real one. Simple. This is\nfunction. The real one. Simple. This is\nfunction. The real one. Simple. This is the real one. Let me just use a color.\nthe real one. Let me just use a color.\nthe real one. Let me just use a color. Let's say like this. So this is a\nLet's say like this. So this is a\nLet's say like this. So this is a function and outside you have applied a\nfunction and outside you have applied a\nfunction and outside you have applied a wrapper and it has become a tool. Let's\nwrapper and it has become a tool. Let's\nwrapper and it has become a tool. Let's say I will use icon for this.\nsay I will use icon for this.\nsay I will use icon for this. Do I have a special icon? Let's say this\nDo I have a special icon? Let's say this\nDo I have a special icon? Let's say this one. Let's say this one. So this is my\none. Let's say this one. So this is my\none. Let's say this one. So this is my tool. Now why? Because I have use this\ntool. Now why? Because I have use this\ntool. Now why? Because I have use this wrapper. Now you can ask me that an\nwrapper. Now you can ask me that an\nwrapper. Now you can ask me that an Lamba\nwhat is the limit? What is the limit to\nwhat is the limit? What is the limit to create a function in Lang? I will say\ncreate a function in Lang? I will say\ncreate a function in Lang? I will say sky is the limit. Oh wow wow wow. Very\nsky is the limit. Oh wow wow wow. Very\nsky is the limit. Oh wow wow wow. Very good dialogue. We are listening to this\ngood dialogue. We are listening to this\ngood dialogue. We are listening to this dialogue for the first time. Okay but\ndialogue for the first time. Okay but\ndialogue for the first time. Okay but this is true. This is true. You can just\nthis is true. This is true. You can just\nthis is true. This is true. You can just create any tool any function. Do you\ncreate any tool any function. Do you\ncreate any tool any function. Do you know what you can build your Python\nknow what you can build your Python\nknow what you can build your Python function and in Python function you know\nfunction and in Python function you know\nfunction and in Python function you know that you can literally perform anything\nthat you can literally perform anything\nthat you can literally perform anything because Python has like thousands of\nbecause Python has like thousands of\nbecause Python has like thousands of libraries. You can make an API call. You\nlibraries. You can make an API call. You\nlibraries. You can make an API call. You can literally perform anything within\ncan literally perform anything within\ncan literally perform anything within the tool and you can use the tool object\nthe tool and you can use the tool object\nthe tool and you can use the tool object available in the lang chain and lang\navailable in the lang chain and lang\navailable in the lang chain and lang graph and then that tool that function\ngraph and then that tool that function\ngraph and then that tool that function will be converted into a tool. Simple\nwill be converted into a tool. Simple\nwill be converted into a tool. Simple very simple. Let me just show you by\nvery simple. Let me just show you by\nvery simple. Let me just show you by creating one so that you can just\ncreating one so that you can just\ncreating one so that you can just understand. And by the way before\nunderstand. And by the way before\nunderstand. And by the way before creating one let me just show you the\ncreating one let me just show you the\ncreating one let me just show you the official documentation so that you can\nofficial documentation so that you can\nofficial documentation so that you can see how many tools we have available in\nsee how many tools we have available in\nsee how many tools we have available in langraph which are strongly integrated.\nlangraph which are strongly integrated.\nlangraph which are strongly integrated. Because obviously with Python you can\nBecause obviously with Python you can\nBecause obviously with Python you can literally do anything right using your\nliterally do anything right using your\nliterally do anything right using your own custom code. I am going to show you\nown custom code. I am going to show you\nown custom code. I am going to show you the well integrated code where you do\nthe well integrated code where you do\nthe well integrated code where you do not need to build everything from\nnot need to build everything from\nnot need to build everything from scratch. You just need to use the\nscratch. You just need to use the\nscratch. You just need to use the wrappers. So let me just show you. So if\nwrappers. So let me just show you. So if\nwrappers. So let me just show you. So if I go to\ngo to tools. Perfect. So I am in the\ngo to tools. Perfect. So I am in the lang chain documentation because tools\nlang chain documentation because tools\nlang chain documentation because tools are the part of lang chain and obviously\nare the part of lang chain and obviously\nare the part of lang chain and obviously lang graph automatically because lang\nlang graph automatically because lang\nlang graph automatically because lang graph is built on top of lang chain. So\ngraph is built on top of lang chain. So\ngraph is built on top of lang chain. So these are the tools. If I go to scroll\nthese are the tools. If I go to scroll\nthese are the tools. If I go to scroll down okay so here is the code for\ndown okay so here is the code for\ndown okay so here is the code for customized tool.\ncustomized tool.\ncustomized tool. Here is the customize tool where I can\nHere is the customize tool where I can\nHere is the customize tool where I can literally perform anything. Simple. I\nliterally perform anything. Simple. I\nliterally perform anything. Simple. I can literally perform anything. But if\ncan literally perform anything. But if\ncan literally perform anything. But if you want to use the well integrated\nyou want to use the well integrated\nyou want to use the well integrated tools. So here are the tools. Let me\ntools. So here are the tools. Let me\ntools. So here are the tools. Let me just show you the long list. So we have\njust show you the long list. So we have\njust show you the long list. So we have a long list. I think they have just\na long list. I think they have just\na long list. I think they have just changed the location. That's what they\nchanged the location. That's what they\nchanged the location. That's what they love always. So let me just go to the I\nlove always. So let me just go to the I\nlove always. So let me just go to the I think integrations. Yeah. And I can go\nthink integrations. Yeah. And I can go\nthink integrations. Yeah. And I can go to tools and toolkits. And here you have\nto tools and toolkits. And here you have\nto tools and toolkits. And here you have the all the tools. See bench search,\nthe all the tools. See bench search,\nthe all the tools. See bench search, brave search, chloro, duck go search.\nbrave search, chloro, duck go search.\nbrave search, chloro, duck go search. All of these things are available. Some\nAll of these things are available. Some\nAll of these things are available. Some are free, some are paid and some are API\nare free, some are paid and some are API\nare free, some are paid and some are API based which is like totally dependent\nbased which is like totally dependent\nbased which is like totally dependent upon the server or service service\nupon the server or service service\nupon the server or service service provider.\nprovider.\nprovider. Simple. So let's say I want to create a\nSimple. So let's say I want to create a\nSimple. So let's say I want to create a tool for duck go search. Now what is\ntool for duck go search. Now what is\ntool for duck go search. Now what is this duck go search? Doug go search is a\nthis duck go search? Doug go search is a\nthis duck go search? Doug go search is a you can say search engine kind of thing\nyou can say search engine kind of thing\nyou can say search engine kind of thing that you can simply search something the\nthat you can simply search something the\nthat you can simply search something the same way you do it in Google. So you can\nsame way you do it in Google. So you can\nsame way you do it in Google. So you can do it in duckgo search. Let's say you\ndo it in duckgo search. Let's say you\ndo it in duckgo search. Let's say you want to enable search with your LLM. You\nwant to enable search with your LLM. You\nwant to enable search with your LLM. You can create a tool on top of it. Duck go\ncan create a tool on top of it. Duck go\ncan create a tool on top of it. Duck go search. Wow. Can we do that bro? I will\nsearch. Wow. Can we do that bro? I will\nsearch. Wow. Can we do that bro? I will just show you. Don't worry at all. Okay.\njust show you. Don't worry at all. Okay.\njust show you. Don't worry at all. Okay. So, we have a very long list. Tele\nSo, we have a very long list. Tele\nSo, we have a very long list. Tele search similar to duct search but this\nsearch similar to duct search but this\nsearch similar to duct search but this is paid. But first, thousand services or\nis paid. But first, thousand services or\nis paid. But first, thousand services or you can say first thousand APIs are free\nyou can say first thousand APIs are free\nyou can say first thousand APIs are free every month. Tele search is actually a\nevery month. Tele search is actually a\nevery month. Tele search is actually a very good you can say tool or function\nvery good you can say tool or function\nvery good you can say tool or function that we can just create. And then we\nthat we can just create. And then we\nthat we can just create. And then we have so so so so so many like there's a\nhave so so so so so many like there's a\nhave so so so so so many like there's a long list of tools. See all of these are\nlong list of tools. See all of these are\nlong list of tools. See all of these are well integrated tools. That's why I said\nwell integrated tools. That's why I said\nwell integrated tools. That's why I said like sky is the limit and these are the\nlike sky is the limit and these are the\nlike sky is the limit and these are the well integrated ones. Forget about the\nwell integrated ones. Forget about the\nwell integrated ones. Forget about the custom ones because in the custom tool\ncustom ones because in the custom tool\ncustom ones because in the custom tool you can literally create any API call\nyou can literally create any API call\nyou can literally create any API call right simply make an API call get the\nright simply make an API call get the\nright simply make an API call get the response that will become your tool.\nresponse that will become your tool.\nresponse that will become your tool. Simple. Now let's get started with a\nSimple. Now let's get started with a\nSimple. Now let's get started with a very simple tool. Okay. So what I will\nvery simple tool. Okay. So what I will\nvery simple tool. Okay. So what I will do? I will simply go to duckgo search\ndo? I will simply go to duckgo search\ndo? I will simply go to duckgo search because I want to create this duckgo\nbecause I want to create this duckgo\nbecause I want to create this duckgo search tool. Simple. Okay. So how we can\nsearch tool. Simple. Okay. So how we can\nsearch tool. Simple. Okay. So how we can just create this? We first of all need\njust create this? We first of all need\njust create this? We first of all need to install this library duck go search.\nto install this library duck go search.\nto install this library duck go search. Okay. And langen community because these\nOkay.

Wow. That means if my LLM, this one\nWow. That means if my LLM, this one\nWow. That means if my LLM, this one doesn't have any kind of latest\ndoesn't have any kind of latest\ndoesn't have any kind of latest information, latest knowledge about any\ninformation, latest knowledge about any\ninformation, latest knowledge about any topic, I can use this tool to get the\ntopic, I can use this tool to get the\ntopic, I can use this tool to get the latest information and then I can\nlatest information and then I can\nlatest information and then I can provide that this information to my LLM.\nprovide that this information to my LLM.\nprovide that this information to my LLM. Wow. Yes. and then LLM will make the use\nWow. Yes. and then LLM will make the use\nWow. Yes. and then LLM will make the use of that information. That's how we\nof that information. That's how we\nof that information. That's how we provide the runtime information during\nprovide the runtime information during\nprovide the runtime information during the LLM calls. That is the best way\nthe LLM calls. That is the best way\nthe LLM calls. That is the best way because LLMs are not being trained on a\nbecause LLMs are not being trained on a\nbecause LLMs are not being trained on a daily basis by those providers. They\ndaily basis by those providers. They\ndaily basis by those providers. They cannot train it on a daily basis. It's\ncannot train it on a daily basis. It's\ncannot train it on a daily basis. It's very expensive. They train it I would\nvery expensive. They train it I would\nvery expensive. They train it I would say nowadays quarterly or let's say once\nsay nowadays quarterly or let's say once\nsay nowadays quarterly or let's say once in 6 months. So you have to provide all\nin 6 months. So you have to provide all\nin 6 months. So you have to provide all of the capabilities to your LLM. Okay.\nof the capabilities to your LLM. Okay.\nof the capabilities to your LLM. Okay. So this is my first tool that I have\nSo this is my first tool that I have\nSo this is my first tool that I have created. So I can also write it here.\ncreated. So I can also write it here.\ncreated. So I can also write it here. Let's say\nuh ductgo search tool. Simple. So this\nuh ductgo search tool. Simple. So this is my duct search tool. Similarly, I\nis my duct search tool. Similarly, I\nis my duct search tool. Similarly, I also want to create one more tool. So\nalso want to create one more tool. So\nalso want to create one more tool. So this was for search engine. Now there is\nthis was for search engine. Now there is\nthis was for search engine. Now there is a very good tool for arsive. If you\na very good tool for arsive. If you\na very good tool for arsive. If you haven't heard about arsive tool, arsive\nhaven't heard about arsive tool, arsive\nhaven't heard about arsive tool, arsive is a tool which is built specifically\nis a tool which is built specifically\nis a tool which is built specifically for research papers. Okay.\nfor research papers. Okay.\nfor research papers. Okay. So let's try to see how we can just\nSo let's try to see how we can just\nSo let's try to see how we can just create the RF tool. Um\ncreate the RF tool. Um\ncreate the RF tool. Um let's go here.\nlet's go here.\nlet's go here. So for RF you just need to install. We\nSo for RF you just need to install. We\nSo for RF you just need to install. We have already installed language\nhave already installed language\nhave already installed language committee. So just ignore.\ncommittee. So just ignore.\ncommittee. So just ignore. Um here we can just say where is my RF.\nUm here we can just say where is my RF.\nUm here we can just say where is my RF. Okay. So this is retriever. We do not\nOkay. So this is retriever. We do not\nOkay. So this is retriever. We do not need to worry about retriever.\nneed to worry about retriever.\nneed to worry about retriever. Rip retriever. Oh, so they have just\nRip retriever. Oh, so they have just\nRip retriever. Oh, so they have just created the retriever on top of RS\ncreated the retriever on top of RS\ncreated the retriever on top of RS retriever. I thought like this is a rag.\nretriever. I thought like this is a rag.\nretriever. I thought like this is a rag. Okay, that's fine. And then\nOkay, that's fine. And then\nOkay, that's fine. And then retriever.invoke and they have just\nretriever.invoke and they have just\nretriever.invoke and they have just invoked this thing. By the way, these\ninvoked this thing. By the way, these\ninvoked this thing. By the way, these are the numbers that you see on the\nare the numbers that you see on the\nare the numbers that you see on the research papers. Okay, but you can also\nresearch papers. Okay, but you can also\nresearch papers. Okay, but you can also search it by title. Makes sense. So now\nsearch it by title. Makes sense. So now\nsearch it by title. Makes sense. So now let's try to create this tool. Okay, now\nlet's try to create this tool. Okay, now\nlet's try to create this tool. Okay, now let's see. So I will simply get this\nlet's see. So I will simply get this\nlet's see. So I will simply get this tool and let's try to create it. So from\ntool and let's try to create it. So from\ntool and let's try to create it. So from languin committee. retrievers. Import\nlanguin committee. retrievers. Import\nlanguin committee. retrievers. Import archive retriever. And let me just write\narxive retriever. Perfect. And it we\narxive retriever. Perfect. And it we have just passed some parameters load\nhave just passed some parameters load\nhave just passed some parameters load maximum documents get full documents\nmaximum documents get full documents\nmaximum documents get full documents equals to true and blah blah blah.\nequals to true and blah blah blah.\nequals to true and blah blah blah. Now this is saying that could not import\nNow this is saying that could not import\nNow this is saying that could not import rython. Uh this is fine. This is like\nrython. Uh this is fine. This is like\nrython. Uh this is fine. This is like expected. We can simply quickly say\nexpected. We can simply quickly say\nexpected. We can simply quickly say uh u add\nuh u add\nuh u add arxit because it needs oops\narxit because it needs oops\narxit because it needs oops arzip because it needs that particular\narzip because it needs that particular\narzip because it needs that particular package that is fine.\npackage that is fine.\npackage that is fine. This error we can expect not a big deal.\nThis error we can expect not a big deal.\nThis error we can expect not a big deal. So this object is created arsive\nSo this object is created arsive\nSo this object is created arsive retriever make sense. Now what I will do\nretriever make sense. Now what I will do\nretriever make sense. Now what I will do I will invoke it. Okay I will invoke it.\nI will invoke it. Okay I will invoke it.\nI will invoke it. Okay I will invoke it. So basically whenever I invoke this\nSo basically whenever I invoke this\nSo basically whenever I invoke this particular tool this gives me the\nparticular tool this gives me the\nparticular tool this gives me the information in the form of chunks or\ninformation in the form of chunks or\ninformation in the form of chunks or basically the documentations because\nbasically the documentations because\nbasically the documentations because research papers are big right so that is\nresearch papers are big right so that is\nresearch papers are big right so that is why so what can I do I can literally\nwhy so what can I do I can literally\nwhy so what can I do I can literally perform anything using this particular\nperform anything using this particular\nperform anything using this particular text\ntext\ntext okay let's try to search anything\nokay let's try to search anything\nokay let's try to search anything related to research papers let's say I\nrelated to research papers let's say I\nrelated to research papers let's say I want to fetch something related to\nwant to fetch something related to\nwant to fetch something related to transformers I will simply Okay,\narcs retriever dot invoke and I will say\narcs retriever dot invoke and I will say transformers in NLP. Let's search and my\ntransformers in NLP. Let's search and my\ntransformers in NLP. Let's search and my pi mu peddia package was found. Okay,\npi mu peddia package was found. Okay,\npi mu peddia package was found. Okay, you need this package as well. Let me\nyou need this package as well. Let me\nyou need this package as well. Let me install it\ninstall it\ninstall it uv because there are like so many\nuv because there are like so many\nuv because there are like so many packages whenever you work with these\npackages whenever you work with these\npackages whenever you work with these kind of frameworks. So do not feel\nkind of frameworks. So do not feel\nkind of frameworks. So do not feel frustrated. We have to install all of\nfrustrated. We have to install all of\nfrustrated. We have to install all of these packages.\nthese packages.\nthese packages. So let's see what we get.\nSo let's see what we get.\nSo let's see what we get. We should get the documents first of all\nWe should get the documents first of all\nWe should get the documents first of all for this particular information\nfor this particular information\nfor this particular information transformers in NLP. Okay, simple.\ntransformers in NLP. Okay, simple.\ntransformers in NLP. Okay, simple. So this is like one way of working with\nSo this is like one way of working with\nSo this is like one way of working with specially what do you want? Did I hit on\nspecially what do you want? Did I hit on\nspecially what do you want? Did I hit on um did I hit the interrupt button? I\num did I hit the interrupt button? I\num did I hit the interrupt button? I think so. Okay, it's fine. So I was\nthink so. Okay, it's fine. So I was\nthink so. Okay, it's fine. So I was saying like this is only one of the ways\nsaying like this is only one of the ways\nsaying like this is only one of the ways that how you can just create the arcs\nthat how you can just create the arcs\nthat how you can just create the arcs tool.\ntool.\ntool. This basically acts as a kind of rag\nThis basically acts as a kind of rag\nThis basically acts as a kind of rag or you can say retriever. There is one\nor you can say retriever. There is one\nor you can say retriever. There is one more way how we can just create the RC\nmore way how we can just create the RC\nmore way how we can just create the RC retriever and I want to show you that\nretriever and I want to show you that\nretriever and I want to show you that way because that is much more optimized\nway because that is much more optimized\nway because that is much more optimized plus that is the way that we use with\nplus that is the way that we use with\nplus that is the way that we use with the um Wikipedia wrapper as well. Okay.\nthe um Wikipedia wrapper as well. Okay.\nthe um Wikipedia wrapper as well. Okay. So let's say I want to use that thing.\nSo let's say I want to use that thing.\nSo let's say I want to use that thing. So I will simply say from langchain\nSo I will simply say from langchain\nSo I will simply say from langchain utility uh community dot tools import I\nutility uh community dot tools import I\nutility uh community dot tools import I think it's called arxim query run.

Why? Because you also\nof query search. Why? Because you also\nof query search. Why? Because you also need to pass one more function which is\nneed to pass one more function which is\nneed to pass one more function which is called API wrapper. Now what is this API\ncalled API wrapper. Now what is this API\ncalled API wrapper. Now what is this API wrapper? API wrapper is a kind of you\nwrapper? API wrapper is a kind of you\nwrapper? API wrapper is a kind of you can say object that is already created\ncan say object that is already created\ncan say object that is already created by Langra for you. So you do not need to\nby Langra for you. So you do not need to\nby Langra for you. So you do not need to create it on your own\ncreate it on your own\ncreate it on your own make sense? So this is just the API\nmake sense? So this is just the API\nmake sense? So this is just the API wrapper. Okay. And how you can just pass\nwrapper. Okay. And how you can just pass\nwrapper. Okay. And how you can just pass it? Simply search API wrapper and pass\nit? Simply search API wrapper and pass\nit? Simply search API wrapper and pass it like this. Perfect. And there's like\nit like this.

This this is my custom\nThis is my tool. This this is my custom\nThis is my tool. This this is my custom tool. Now in order to convert your\ntool. Now in order to convert your\ntool. Now in order to convert your normal function into a tool, you simply\nnormal function into a tool, you simply\nnormal function into a tool, you simply need to use a decorator called tool. Now\nneed to use a decorator called tool. Now\nneed to use a decorator called tool. Now this decorator is not available there.\nthis decorator is not available there.\nthis decorator is not available there. You have to import it. This is not\nYou have to import it. This is not\nYou have to import it. This is not available by there like there by\navailable by there like there by\navailable by there like there by default. So there's a special function\ndefault. So there's a special function\ndefault. So there's a special function or you can say package available in\nor you can say package available in\nor you can say package available in lang. It's called\nlang. It's called\nlang. It's called from\nfrom\nfrom langchain\nlangchain\nlangchain dot tools\ndot tools\ndot tools import tool simple\nimport tool simple\nimport tool simple uh lang chain what do you mean from lang\nuh lang chain what do you mean from lang\nuh lang chain what do you mean from lang chain didn't didn't we install lang\nchain didn't didn't we install lang\nchain didn't didn't we install lang chain I think we didn't install lang\nchain I think we didn't install lang\nchain I think we didn't install lang chain we only install lang chain core\nchain we only install lang chain core\nchain we only install lang chain core wow\nokay let me just install it.\nokay let me just install it. Okay, now it's fine. So now I will\nOkay, now it's fine. So now I will\nOkay, now it's fine. So now I will simply run this thing. Perfect. So now\nsimply run this thing. Perfect. So now\nsimply run this thing. Perfect. So now you will see this function is\nyou will see this function is\nyou will see this function is automatically converted into a tool\nautomatically converted into a tool\nautomatically converted into a tool using this decorator. If you do not know\nusing this decorator. If you do not know\nusing this decorator. If you do not know about decorator, decorator is again like\nabout decorator, decorator is again like\nabout decorator, decorator is again like Python fundamental thing which takes\nPython fundamental thing which takes\nPython fundamental thing which takes your function and decorates it. It\nyour function and decorates it. It\nyour function and decorates it. It modifies the function the behavior of\nmodifies the function the behavior of\nmodifies the function the behavior of the function. So it will internally\nthe function. So it will internally\nthe function. So it will internally convert that function into a tool.\nconvert that function into a tool.\nconvert that function into a tool. Make sense? automatically.\nMake sense? automatically.\nMake sense? automatically. Very good. Now lamba\nVery good. Now lamba\nVery good. Now lamba how we can convert these things into a\nhow we can convert these things into a\nhow we can convert these things into a tool. Do you know what this is already a\ntool. Do you know what this is already a\ntool. Do you know what this is already a tool? Really? Yes. Because you're using\ntool? Really? Yes. Because you're using\ntool? Really? Yes. Because you're using dot invoke that means this is already a\ndot invoke that means this is already a\ndot invoke that means this is already a tool. But if you take my advice\ntool. But if you take my advice\ntool. But if you take my advice to build better applications,\nto build better applications,\nto build better applications, you should always always always\nyou should always always always\nyou should always always always encapsulate your well integrated okay\nencapsulate your well integrated okay\nencapsulate your well integrated okay well integrated tools as well in your\nwell integrated tools as well in your\nwell integrated tools as well in your normal custom Python functions.\nnormal custom Python functions.\nnormal custom Python functions. It promotes readability. It promotes\nIt promotes readability. It promotes\nIt promotes readability. It promotes better uh you can say management of your\nbetter uh you can say management of your\nbetter uh you can say management of your code and you will actually see the\ncode and you will actually see the\ncode and you will actually see the results where you will when you will\nresults where you will when you will\nresults where you will when you will just do this. So how you can just do\njust do this. So how you can just do\njust do this. So how you can just do that? you will simply create need to\nthat? you will simply create need to\nthat? you will simply create need to create DF okay and then let's say DF um\ncreate DF okay and then let's say DF um\ncreate DF okay and then let's say DF um Wikipedia\nWikipedia\nWikipedia wiki tool basically and it receives\nwiki tool basically and it receives\nwiki tool basically and it receives query and it returns the results in the\nquery and it returns the results in the\nquery and it returns the results in the query format and I can remove this thing\nquery format and I can remove this thing\nquery format and I can remove this thing perfect and I can add a sweet and quick\nperfect and I can add a sweet and quick\nperfect and I can add a sweet and quick dock string that this is a tool\ndock string that this is a tool\ndock string that this is a tool this tool allows you to search Wikipedia\nthis tool allows you to search Wikipedia\nthis tool allows you to search Wikipedia for information on a given topic simple\nfor information on a given topic simple\nfor information on a given topic simple and I can use add the tool to convert\nand I can use add the tool to convert\nand I can use add the tool to convert into a tool right and I can also provide\ninto a tool right and I can also provide\ninto a tool right and I can also provide the tool name but if it not provide\nthe tool name but if it not provide\nthe tool name but if it not provide anything it will take this thing which\nanything it will take this thing which\nanything it will take this thing which is fine same thing here as well okay so\nis fine same thing here as well okay so\nis fine same thing here as well okay so I will simply say df simple and I will\nI will simply say df simple and I will\nI will simply say df simple and I will say\nsay\nsay rip tool and then query and that's it\nrip tool and then query and that's it\nrip tool and then query and that's it that's it\nthat's it\nthat's it and then one nice and short dock string\nand then one nice and short dock string\nand then one nice and short dock string this tool\nlet's say allows you to query on the RC\nlet's say allows you to query on the RC database for research papers\ndatabase for research papers\ndatabase for research papers simple because there's a very big\nsimple because there's a very big\nsimple because there's a very big database for arriv\ndatabase for arriv\ndatabase for arriv so this is your tool now let me just say\nso this is your tool now let me just say\nso this is your tool now let me just say at the rate tool\nat the rate tool\nat the rate tool simple simple simple simple good that is\nsimple simple simple simple good that is\nsimple simple simple simple good that is the best way to create a tool let me\nthe best way to create a tool let me\nthe best way to create a tool let me just do it for this as well\njust do it for this as well\njust do it for this as well df and search go And let me just remove\ndf and search go And let me just remove\ndf and search go And let me just remove this.\nAnd here I can say this tool\nAnd here I can say this tool searches Dr. Go for the given results.\nsearches Dr. Go for the given results.\nsearches Dr. Go for the given results. Simple. Now you have created four tools.\nSimple. Now you have created four tools.\nSimple. Now you have created four tools. Tool one, tool two, tool three and tool\nTool one, tool two, tool three and tool\nTool one, tool two, tool three and tool four which is a custom tool. Okay. And\nfour which is a custom tool. Okay. And\nfour which is a custom tool. Okay. And you can even test it this custom tool.\nyou can even test it this custom tool.\nyou can even test it this custom tool. You can simply say um personal\nYou can simply say um personal\nYou can simply say um personal info.invoke\ninfo.invoke\ninfo.invoke and you can say allies. Okay. And you\nand you can say allies. Okay. And you\nand you can say allies. Okay. And you will see Ally is a software engineer\nwill see Ally is a software engineer\nwill see Ally is a software engineer with five years of experience in AI.\nwith five years of experience in AI.\nwith five years of experience in AI. Perfect. This is working fine. Now these\nPerfect. This is working fine. Now these\nPerfect. This is working fine. Now these are the four tools that I have created\nare the four tools that I have created\nare the four tools that I have created and that is fine. Now it's time for tool\nand that is fine. Now it's time for tool\nand that is fine. Now it's time for tool binding.\nbinding.\nbinding. Okay. How we can just bind the tools?\nOkay. How we can just bind the tools?\nOkay. How we can just bind the tools? First of all, not all the models allow\nFirst of all, not all the models allow\nFirst of all, not all the models allow tool binding capabilities. Only OpenAI\ntool binding capabilities. Only OpenAI\ntool binding capabilities. Only OpenAI models, Anthropic, Gemini and there are\nmodels, Anthropic, Gemini and there are\nmodels, Anthropic, Gemini and there are some other models which allow tool\nsome other models which allow tool\nsome other models which allow tool binding. Not every model allows tool\nbinding. Not every model allows tool\nbinding. Not every model allows tool binding. So just make sure your model\nbinding. So just make sure your model\nbinding. So just make sure your model allows tool binding. So now I will\nallows tool binding. So now I will\nallows tool binding. So now I will perform\ntool binding.\ntool binding. Okay. And in order to bind the tools, we\nOkay. And in order to bind the tools, we\nOkay. And in order to bind the tools, we first need to combine all the tools. I\nfirst need to combine all the tools. I\nfirst need to combine all the tools. I will say tools equals and create a\nwill say tools equals and create a\nwill say tools equals and create a simple list. Then simply say llm\nsimple list. Then simply say llm\nsimple list. Then simply say llm with tools\nwith tools\nwith tools equals your regular llm object dotbind\nequals your regular llm object dotbind\nequals your regular llm object dotbind tools. And then you can simply say\ntools. And then you can simply say\ntools. And then you can simply say dotpine tools and then tools. Now run\ndotpine tools and then tools.

Okay, in the real world obviously we\nme. Okay, in the real world obviously we just simply provide so much of context\njust simply provide so much of context\njust simply provide so much of context but I'm simply\nbut I'm simply\nbut I'm simply like trying my best to just use this\nlike trying my best to just use this\nlike trying my best to just use this tool. Okay, simple\ntool. Okay, simple\ntool. Okay, simple and obviously this is like not a very\nand obviously this is like not a very\nand obviously this is like not a very you can say user friendly or LLM\nyou can say user friendly or LLM\nyou can say user friendly or LLM friendly function or tool which is like\nfriendly function or tool which is like\nfriendly function or tool which is like personal info. So what I can do I can\npersonal info. So what I can do I can\npersonal info. So what I can do I can just try to make a realistic or real\njust try to make a realistic or real\njust try to make a realistic or real world LLM call so that LLM can also\nworld LLM call so that LLM can also\nworld LLM call so that LLM can also cooperate with us obviously let's say I\ncooperate with us obviously let's say I\ncooperate with us obviously let's say I want to make the API call for this and\nwant to make the API call for this and\nwant to make the API call for this and this says this tool searches duck go for\nthis says this tool searches duck go for\nthis says this tool searches duck go for the given query and return the results\nthe given query and return the results\nthe given query and return the results or let's say this tool searches the\nor let's say this tool searches the\nor let's say this tool searches the latest\nlatest\nlatest news\nnews\nnews on duck go and whatever okay let's say I\non duck go and whatever okay let's say I\non duck go and whatever okay let's say I want to do this thing so if I just pass\nwant to do this thing so if I just pass\nwant to do this thing so if I just pass a query let's say what is the latest\nnews on AI if I search this thing now\nnews on AI if I search this thing now obviously LLM doesn't have any kind of\nobviously LLM doesn't have any kind of\nobviously LLM doesn't have any kind of capability about\ncapability about\ncapability about latest news perfect this is the exact\nlatest news perfect this is the exact\nlatest news perfect this is the exact answer see when you use realistic\nanswer see when you use realistic\nanswer see when you use realistic examples you get the right response but\nexamples you get the right response but\nexamples you get the right response but when you just try to play around it you\nwhen you just try to play around it you\nwhen you just try to play around it you will not see the thing so see now you\nwill not see the thing so see now you\nwill not see the thing so see now you are seeing what content equals to null\nare seeing what content equals to null\nare seeing what content equals to null very\nvery\nvery You will say what very good we didn't\nYou will say what very good we didn't\nYou will say what very good we didn't have re we we haven't received anything.\nhave re we we haven't received anything.\nhave re we we haven't received anything. You should not receive anything. LLM\nYou should not receive anything. LLM\nYou should not receive anything. LLM should not generate anything for you.\nshould not generate anything for you.\nshould not generate anything for you. Why? Because LLM doesn't have any access\nWhy? Because LLM doesn't have any access\nWhy? Because LLM doesn't have any access to the latest news. Right? But do you\nto the latest news. Right? But do you\nto the latest news. Right? But do you know what it will do now? This is not a\nknow what it will do now? This is not a\nknow what it will do now? This is not a regular LLM. Right? Now this is the LLM\nregular LLM. Right? Now this is the LLM\nregular LLM. Right? Now this is the LLM with tools. So now you will see an\nwith tools. So now you will see an\nwith tools. So now you will see an additional parameter called\nadditional parameter called\nadditional parameter called called\ncalled\ncalled tools. Let me show you.\nLet me just show you. Uh it will be like\nLet me just show you. Uh it will be like towards right. Yeah. Tool calls.\nSo it is actually telling you that I am\nSo it is actually telling you that I am just making the tool calls. Simple. It\njust making the tool calls. Simple. It\njust making the tool calls. Simple. It is telling you this thing that I am just\nis telling you this thing that I am just\nis telling you this thing that I am just making the tool calls.\nmaking the tool calls.\nmaking the tool calls. You can also fetch it like this. Let's\nYou can also fetch it like this. Let's\nYou can also fetch it like this. Let's say\nsay\nsay this is the response because I just want\nthis is the response because I just want\nthis is the response because I just want to make it clean. Response dot tool\nto make it clean. Response dot tool\nto make it clean. Response dot tool calls.\ncalls.\ncalls. Now you will see what exactly tool call\nNow you will see what exactly tool call\nNow you will see what exactly tool call it is referring to what exactly it is\nit is referring to what exactly it is\nit is referring to what exactly it is saying to actually do. So tool call is\nsaying to actually do. So tool call is\nsaying to actually do. So tool call is duggo search and rx tool because both\nduggo search and rx tool because both\nduggo search and rx tool because both can have the information about it\ncan have the information about it\ncan have the information about it because maybe some latest research\nbecause maybe some latest research\nbecause maybe some latest research papers are there or obviously the search\npapers are there or obviously the search\npapers are there or obviously the search engine. So it has not generated\nengine. So it has not generated\nengine. So it has not generated anything. If I say dot content,\nanything. If I say dot content,\nanything. If I say dot content, I will see nothing. No response from\nI will see nothing. No response from\nI will see nothing. No response from llm. But when I say let's wait for it to\nllm. But when I say let's wait for it to\nllm. But when I say let's wait for it to end or let me just write the query here.\nend or let me just write the query here.\nend or let me just write the query here. Okay, it's done. So see nothing. But\nOkay, it's done. So see nothing. But\nOkay, it's done. So see nothing. But when I say tool calls,\nwhen I say tool calls,\nwhen I say tool calls, that means now LLM is trying to say\nthat means now LLM is trying to say\nthat means now LLM is trying to say okay, I cannot generate this thing, but\nokay, I cannot generate this thing, but\nokay, I cannot generate this thing, but I can make tool calls. I can make it\nI can make tool calls. I can make it\nI can make tool calls. I can make it hasn't made anything yet it can make but\nhasn't made anything yet it can make but\nhasn't made anything yet it can make but in case of lang chain it will directly\nin case of lang chain it will directly\nin case of lang chain it will directly make the tool calls that is the\nmake the tool calls that is the\nmake the tool calls that is the difference\ndifference\ndifference that's why we follow the function\nthat's why we follow the function\nthat's why we follow the function calling approach in lang graph make\ncalling approach in lang graph make\ncalling approach in lang graph make sense this lecture was actually\nsense this lecture was actually\nsense this lecture was actually important to understand the next lecture\nimportant to understand the next lecture\nimportant to understand the next lecture or basically the next part of the video\nor basically the next part of the video\nor basically the next part of the video or basically next segment of the video\nor basically next segment of the video\nor basically next segment of the video which is all about building the react\nwhich is all about building the react\nwhich is all about building the react agents simple now let's see how we can\nagents simple now let's see how we can\nagents simple now let's see how we can just build the react agent that we\njust build the react agent that we\njust build the react agent that we discussed in the very beginning. Okay.\ndiscussed in the very beginning. Okay.\ndiscussed in the very beginning. Okay. And just to refresh that we discussed in\nAnd just to refresh that we discussed in\nAnd just to refresh that we discussed in the react agent. Let me just quickly\nthe react agent. Let me just quickly\nthe react agent. Let me just quickly pull that\npull that\npull that you can say\nyou can say\nyou can say slide. So this is react agent. Now you\nslide. So this is react agent. Now you\nslide. So this is react agent. Now you can understand this easily\ncan understand this easily\ncan understand this easily what exactly we're trying to do here. We\nwhat exactly we're trying to do here. We\nwhat exactly we're trying to do here. We are using our LLM.\nare using our LLM.\nare using our LLM.

Okay, simple. So now let me just create\nOkay, simple. So now let me just create\nOkay, simple. So now let me just create the LLM node. So I will create the\nthe LLM node. So I will create the\nthe LLM node. So I will create the function uh code df\nfunction uh code df\nfunction uh code df lm node. Simple and this will receive\nlm node. Simple and this will receive\nlm node. Simple and this will receive the state of graph schema data type and\nthe state of graph schema data type and\nthe state of graph schema data type and then it will return graph schema.\nthen it will return graph schema.\nthen it will return graph schema. Perfect. And as you know that this node\nPerfect. And as you know that this node\nPerfect.

Everything is mentioned in detail in this video about all of\nin detail in this video about all of\nin detail in this video about all of this that I have just written here.\nthis that I have just written here.\nthis that I have just written here. Simple. Very good. So now my LLM node is\nSimple. Very good. So now my LLM node is\nSimple. Very good. So now my LLM node is ready. After the LLM node,\nready. After the LLM node,\nready. After the LLM node, we have two options. If I just show you\nwe have two options. If I just show you\nwe have two options. If I just show you the graph, I have two options. Either\nthe graph, I have two options. Either\nthe graph, I have two options. Either directly generate the output or make the\ndirectly generate the output or make the\ndirectly generate the output or make the call to the tool calls. Right? Now I\ncall to the tool calls. Right? Now I\ncall to the tool calls. Right? Now I need to create a tool node. Now the good\nneed to create a tool node. Now the good\nneed to create a tool node. Now the good thing is there is a built-in node called\nthing is there is a built-in node called\nthing is there is a built-in node called tool node. Yes, it's called from\ntool node. Yes, it's called from\ntool node. Yes, it's called from langraph.\nlangraph.\nlangraph. From langraph\nFrom langraph\nFrom langraph dotbuiltin.\nOkay. And I think I just need to import\nOkay. And I think I just need to import it like this.\nit like this.\nit like this. So you can say UV add\nLet me just hit enter was not found. Uh\nLet me just hit enter was not found. Uh let me just check the exact name. Uh\nlet me just check the exact name. Uh\nlet me just check the exact name. Uh pre-built sorry not built in pre-built.\npre-built sorry not built in pre-built.\npre-built sorry not built in pre-built. Okay\nOkay\nOkay pre-built import\npre-built import\npre-built import tool node. So this node is already there\ntool node. So this node is already there\ntool node. So this node is already there for you. But what did I say in the\nfor you. But what did I say in the\nfor you. But what did I say in the beginning of this course? I want full\nbeginning of this course? I want full\nbeginning of this course? I want full control for my code. I can use this tool\ncontrol for my code. I can use this tool\ncontrol for my code. I can use this tool node. I can but I will just show you how\nnode. I can but I will just show you how\nnode. I can but I will just show you how you can just take the full control of\nyou can just take the full control of\nyou can just take the full control of your code. So I will simply comment it\nyour code. So I will simply comment it\nyour code. So I will simply comment it out. I will not use it. I can but I will\nout. I will not use it. I can but I will\nout. I will not use it. I can but I will create my own custom tool node so that I\ncreate my own custom tool node so that I\ncreate my own custom tool node so that I can customize it. Because when you work\ncan customize it. Because when you work\ncan customize it. Because when you work with the real world situations, let's\nwith the real world situations, let's\nwith the real world situations, let's say in the corporate in the industry, we\nsay in the corporate in the industry, we\nsay in the corporate in the industry, we have to customize it. I'm just telling\nhave to customize it. I'm just telling\nhave to customize it. I'm just telling you from my experience. I'm telling you.\nyou from my experience. I'm telling you.\nyou from my experience. I'm telling you. So do not rely on just this by default\nSo do not rely on just this by default\nSo do not rely on just this by default tool node. You need to learn how to\ntool node. You need to learn how to\ntool node. You need to learn how to create your custom tool node as well. So\ncreate your custom tool node as well. So\ncreate your custom tool node as well. So let's create it. DF and I will simply\nlet's create it. DF and I will simply\nlet's create it. DF and I will simply say tool node. And now the concept of\nsay tool node. And now the concept of\nsay tool node. And now the concept of tool node is very simple.\ntool node is very simple.\ntool node is very simple. Very very simple. inside this tool node.\nVery very simple. inside this tool node.\nVery very simple. inside this tool node. First of all, I will get the state graph\nFirst of all, I will get the state graph\nFirst of all, I will get the state graph and\nand\nand get the graph schema. Now, I will get\nget the graph schema. Now, I will get\nget the graph schema. Now, I will get the messages. Okay, messages\nthe messages. Okay, messages\nthe messages. Okay, messages equals state of messages. Now, just tell\nequals state of messages. Now, just tell\nequals state of messages. Now, just tell me one thing.\nme one thing.\nme one thing. When we made the tool call like this,\nWhen we made the tool call like this,\nWhen we made the tool call like this, like this here, what did I see? Tool\nlike this here, what did I see? Tool\nlike this here, what did I see? Tool calls all of the tool calls, right? In\ncalls all of the tool calls, right? In\ncalls all of the tool calls, right? In the form of list, I just need these tool\nthe form of list, I just need these tool\nthe form of list, I just need these tool calls. Why? Because in this list I have\ncalls. Why? Because in this list I have\ncalls. Why? Because in this list I have all the information tool name, tool ID\nall the information tool name, tool ID\nall the information tool name, tool ID and the arguments that I need to pass\nand the arguments that I need to pass\nand the arguments that I need to pass and I just need exactly this information\nand I just need exactly this information\nand I just need exactly this information to pass it to my LLM so that it can\nto pass it to my LLM so that it can\nto pass it to my LLM so that it can efficiently make the tool node\nefficiently make the tool node\nefficiently make the tool node right efficiently make the tool node. So\nright efficiently make the tool node. So\nright efficiently make the tool node. So now what I will do I will go to this\nnow what I will do I will go to this\nnow what I will do I will go to this tool node. Okay, this you can say custom\ntool node. Okay, this you can say custom\ntool node. Okay, this you can say custom tool to tool node. Then I will manually\ntool to tool node. Then I will manually\ntool to tool node. Then I will manually fetch all of the tool calls and I will\nfetch all of the tool calls and I will\nfetch all of the tool calls and I will run a loop and I will invoke every\nrun a loop and I will invoke every\nrun a loop and I will invoke every single tool that needs to be invoked by\nsingle tool that needs to be invoked by\nsingle tool that needs to be invoked by myself\nmyself\nmyself and I will append this information into\nand I will append this information into\nand I will append this information into the result by myself.\nthe result by myself.\nthe result by myself. Make sense? If not don't worry let me\nMake sense? If not don't worry let me\nMake sense? If not don't worry let me just write the code then it will make\njust write the code then it will make\njust write the code then it will make more sense. So first of all I will say\nmore sense. So first of all I will say\nmore sense. So first of all I will say tool results\ntool results\ntool results okay equals to empty list first of all\nokay equals to empty list first of all\nokay equals to empty list first of all this thing. Now I will go for tool in.\nthis thing. Now I will go for tool in.\nthis thing. Now I will go for tool in. Now I need to fetch the list. Where is\nNow I need to fetch the list. Where is\nNow I need to fetch the list. Where is my list? List is here messages\nmy list? List is here messages\nmy list? List is here messages of minus one because I just want the\nof minus one because I just want the\nof minus one because I just want the last message.\nlast message.\nlast message. Simple just last message. Then I will\nSimple just last message. Then I will\nSimple just last message. Then I will say dot tool calls\nsay dot tool calls\nsay dot tool calls because the function name is tool calls.\nbecause the function name is tool calls.\nbecause the function name is tool calls. This is my loop.\nThis is my loop.\nThis is my loop. Simple. Now I will say what is the tool\nSimple. Now I will say what is the tool\nSimple. Now I will say what is the tool name? Tool name is there's a function\nname? Tool name is there's a function\nname? Tool name is there's a function within this. It's called tools by\nwithin this. It's called tools by\nwithin this. It's called tools by name. And then I can say I want to get\nname. And then I can say I want to get\nname. And then I can say I want to get the tool name.\nthe tool name.\nthe tool name. Simple. Now you can use let's say get\nSimple. Now you can use let's say get\nSimple. Now you can use let's say get method as well. that I am a big fan of\nmethod as well. that I am a big fan of\nmethod as well. that I am a big fan of using dictionary notation. I'll simply\nusing dictionary notation. I'll simply\nusing dictionary notation. I'll simply say tool call. This is a kind of\nsay tool call. This is a kind of\nsay tool call. This is a kind of hierarchy dictionary. So do not worry\nhierarchy dictionary. So do not worry\nhierarchy dictionary. So do not worry about that. And then within that we have\nabout that. And then within that we have\nabout that. And then within that we have a parameter called name. Everything is\na parameter called name. Everything is\na parameter called name. Everything is here. Everything is here. See nested\nhere. Everything is here. See nested\nhere. Everything is here. See nested list. And then we have a nested\nlist. And then we have a nested\nlist. And then we have a nested dictionary and this is the thing name.\ndictionary and this is the thing name.\ndictionary and this is the thing name. This is all about dictionary\nThis is all about dictionary\nThis is all about dictionary comprehension that we are just simply\ncomprehension that we are just simply\ncomprehension that we are just simply applying here. That's it.\napplying here. That's it.\napplying here. That's it. Make sense? Nothing fancy. It's all\nMake sense? Nothing fancy. It's all\nMake sense? Nothing fancy. It's all about like pure Python. Pure Python.\nabout like pure Python. Pure Python.\nabout like pure Python. Pure Python. Okay, makes sense. Now once we have\nOkay, makes sense. Now once we have\nOkay, makes sense. Now once we have found out the tool name. Okay, now I can\nfound out the tool name. Okay, now I can\nfound out the tool name. Okay, now I can make the tool call because I know how to\nmake the tool call because I know how to\nmake the tool call because I know how to invoke the tool call. Make sense? So I\ninvoke the tool call. Make sense? So I\ninvoke the tool call. Make sense? So I know like I have tools by name. And then\nknow like I have tools by name. And then\nknow like I have tools by name. And then I will simply say let me just invoke it.\nI will simply say let me just invoke it.\nI will simply say let me just invoke it. Okay, let me just invoke it. So what I\nOkay, let me just invoke it. So what I\nOkay, let me just invoke it. So what I will do? I will simply go to\nwill do? I will simply go to\nwill do? I will simply go to observation\nobservation\nobservation equals tool do.invoke invoke and now\nequals tool do.invoke invoke and now\nequals tool do.invoke invoke and now here when I will say tool.invoke in work\nhere when I will say tool.invoke in work\nhere when I will say tool.invoke in work I need to get the arguments obviously so\nI need to get the arguments obviously so\nI need to get the arguments obviously so I'll simply say tool call\nI'll simply say tool call\nI'll simply say tool call arguments\nargqments\nargqments simple\nsimple\nsimple simple simple simple okay basically tool\nsimple simple simple okay basically tool\nsimple simple simple okay basically tool code not tool call like tool because we\ncode not tool call like tool because we\ncode not tool call like tool because we are simply using tool in the tools\nare simply using tool in the tools\nare simply using tool in the tools simple okay makes sense tool of\nsimple okay makes sense tool of\nsimple okay makes sense tool of arguments now what is this thing this is\narguments now what is this thing this is\narguments now what is this thing this is the result of tool call because we are\nthe result of tool call because we are\nthe result of tool call because we are invoking it Right? With the arguments,\ninvoking it Right? With the arguments,\ninvoking it Right? With the arguments, what arguments? Now you will say Anama\nwhat arguments? Now you will say Anama\nwhat arguments? Now you will say Anama who will provide this arguments llm.\nwho will provide this arguments llm.\nwho will provide this arguments llm. Because LLM cannot invoke the tool on\nBecause LLM cannot invoke the tool on\nBecause LLM cannot invoke the tool on its own, but it can generate the\nits own, but it can generate the\nits own, but it can generate the arguments at least. Why? Because LLM is\narguments at least. Why? Because LLM is\narguments at least. Why? Because LLM is smart enough. LLM can go to your tool.\nsmart enough. LLM can go to your tool.\nsmart enough. LLM can go to your tool. Let's say this tool, this tool or this\nLet's say this tool, this tool or this\nLet's say this tool, this tool or this tool. it will say okay if I want to\ntool. it will say okay if I want to\ntool. it will say okay if I want to invoke this function or this tool um I\ninvoke this function or this tool um I\ninvoke this function or this tool um I want one argument called query and the\nwant one argument called query and the\nwant one argument called query and the data type is of string lm can fetch this\ndata type is of string lm can fetch this\ndata type is of string lm can fetch this information using this particular doc\ninformation using this particular doc\ninformation using this particular doc string as well so that's why when you\nstring as well so that's why when you\nstring as well so that's why when you see the arguments you see query I didn't\nsee the arguments you see query I didn't\nsee the arguments you see query I didn't tell that you need query to just call\ntell that you need query to just call\ntell that you need query to just call the tool call or you if you just want to\nthe tool call or you if you just want to\nthe tool call or you if you just want to make the tool call llm was able to find\nmake the tool call llm was able to find\nmake the tool call llm was able to find out this thing by looking at the\nout this thing by looking at the\nout this thing by looking at the function code it is smart enough and you\nfunction code it is smart enough and you\nfunction code it is smart enough and you can see query and then it has also\ncan see query and then it has also\ncan see query and then it has also passed the value that you need to\npassed the value that you need to\npassed the value that you need to search. So that means LLM do not make\nsearch. So that means LLM do not make\nsearch. So that means LLM do not make the tool calls by itself. It prepares\nthe tool calls by itself. It prepares\nthe tool calls by itself. It prepares everything. It prepares your query\neverything. It prepares your query\neverything. It prepares your query parameter or whatever parameter you have\nparameter or whatever parameter you have\nparameter or whatever parameter you have just passed and all of the things but it\njust passed and all of the things but it\njust passed and all of the things but it will say pro I will not make any tool\nwill say pro I will not make any tool\nwill say pro I will not make any tool call. you will make the tool call but I\ncall. you will make the tool call but I\ncall. you will make the tool call but I will provide you the required\nwill provide you the required\nwill provide you the required ingredients to make the tool call.\ningredients to make the tool call.\ningredients to make the tool call. If you use default tool node which is\nIf you use default tool node which is\nIf you use default tool node which is already there for you, you will never\nalready there for you, you will never\nalready there for you, you will never see this code written because it is\nsee this code written because it is\nsee this code written because it is running behind the scenes and then you\nrunning behind the scenes and then you\nrunning behind the scenes and then you cannot make the customizations. If you\ncannot make the customizations. If you\ncannot make the customizations. If you use this one line of code, I want you to\nuse this one line of code, I want you to\nuse this one line of code, I want you to write this code so that you can\nwrite this code so that you can\nwrite this code so that you can understand what is going on behind the\nunderstand what is going on behind the\nunderstand what is going on behind the scenes.

Very very very good. Simple. So I have\nVery very very good. Simple. So I have\nVery very very good. Simple. So I have this observation. So what I will do? I\nthis observation. So what I will do? I\nthis observation. So what I will do? I will immediately append my tools result\nwill immediately append my tools result\nwill immediately append my tools result list which is empty list with this\nlist which is empty list with this\nlist which is empty list with this particular thing. Simple. And now there\nparticular thing. Simple. And now there\nparticular thing. Simple. And now there is a style. What style? If I want to\nis a style. What style? If I want to\nis a style. What style? If I want to append this particular list.\nappend this particular list.\nappend this particular list. Simple. I can simply you can say add one\nSimple. I can simply you can say add one\nSimple. I can simply you can say add one tool message object so that I will make\ntool message object so that I will make\ntool message object so that I will make you can say a kind of difference like\nyou can say a kind of difference like\nyou can say a kind of difference like what is going on.\nwhat is going on.\nwhat is going on. Make sense? Like I can actually say okay\nMake sense? Like I can actually say okay\nMake sense? Like I can actually say okay this is a tool message and this is the\nthis is a tool message and this is the\nthis is a tool message and this is the content the same way that we that we\ncontent the same way that we that we\ncontent the same way that we that we just use it um um in the system message\njust use it um um in the system message\njust use it um um in the system message or human message. So I will simply say\nor human message. So I will simply say\nor human message. So I will simply say tool message.\ntool message.\ntool message. Okay. And then I will simply say tool\nOkay. And then I will simply say tool\nOkay. And then I will simply say tool name equals to tool call. I do not need\nname equals to tool call. I do not need\nname equals to tool call. I do not need by the way this thing. Then I can say uh\nby the way this thing. Then I can say uh\nby the way this thing. Then I can say uh content\ncontent\ncontent equals to observation. Okay. And then I\nequals to observation. Okay. And then I\nequals to observation. Okay. And then I can just pass a tool called id. That's\ncan just pass a tool called id. That's\ncan just pass a tool called id. That's it. This is just a metadata. Um helpful\nit. This is just a metadata. Um helpful\nit. This is just a metadata. Um helpful for your code. And that's it. Even if\nfor your code. And that's it. Even if\nfor your code. And that's it. Even if you do not pass it, it's fine. Simple.\nyou do not pass it, it's fine. Simple.\nyou do not pass it, it's fine.

And here as well it's not tool call, it's\nhere as well it's not tool call, it's\nhere as well it's not tool call, it's tool. Simple. So we have two warnings.\ntool. Simple. So we have two warnings.\ntool. Simple. So we have two warnings. First of all, I need to import tool\nFirst of all, I need to import tool\nFirst of all, I need to import tool message for sure. Let me just do it\nmessage for sure. Let me just do it\nmessage for sure. Let me just do it quickly.\nquickly.\nquickly. So here I can import tool message.\nSo here I can import tool message.\nSo here I can import tool message. Perfect. And I need to import one more\nPerfect. And I need to import one more\nPerfect. And I need to import one more class. Um yeah, it's fine. So here I\nclass. Um yeah, it's fine. So here I\nclass. Um yeah, it's fine.

Tools by name. I can just solve it. It's not a\nby name. I can just solve it. It's not a\nby name. I can just solve it. It's not a big deal because tools by name is just a\nbig deal because tools by name is just a\nbig deal because tools by name is just a kind of list that we need to just pass\nkind of list that we need to just pass\nkind of list that we need to just pass tools by name equals to tool by name.\ntools by name equals to tool by name.\ntools by name equals to tool by name. You can just actually create a\nYou can just actually create a\nYou can just actually create a dictionary like this as well or\ndictionary like this as well or\ndictionary like this as well or I think it should work. Tool dot name it\nI think it should work. Tool dot name it\nI think it should work. Tool dot name it will use a dot notation.\nwill use a dot notation.\nwill use a dot notation. Okay, I think it should work.\nOkay, I think it should work.\nOkay, I think it should work. Tool dot name I think. So\nTool dot name I think. So\nTool dot name I think. So I can just open the documentation if it\nI can just open the documentation if it\nI can just open the documentation if it doesn't work. It's fine. Okay. So let's\ndoesn't work. It's fine. Okay. So let's\ndoesn't work. It's fine. Okay. So let's try to work with this thing. So what it\ntry to work with this thing. So what it\ntry to work with this thing. So what it will do? It will now actually append\nwill do? It will now actually append\nwill do? It will now actually append this particular tool results. And now\nthis particular tool results.

And now finally I will return what I will update\nfinally I will return what I will update\nfinally I will return what I will update the state with tool results. I will\nthe state with tool results. I will\nthe state with tool results. I will simply say messages plus tool results.\nsimply say messages plus tool results.\nsimply say messages plus tool results. And now I just need to use tool results\nAnd now I just need to use tool results\nAnd now I just need to use tool results because tool results is already a list.\nbecause tool results is already a list.\nbecause tool results is already a list. Simple. It's not a kind of you can say\nSimple. It's not a kind of you can say\nSimple. It's not a kind of you can say any single or independent object. Make\nany single or independent object. Make\nany single or independent object. Make sense? So this is the final final final\nsense? So this is the final final final\nsense? So this is the final final final message. Perfect. So this is the\nmessage. Perfect. So this is the\nmessage. Perfect. So this is the function that I have created. Very good.\nfunction that I have created. Very good.\nfunction that I have created. Very good. Now let's create the nodes. Okay. So\nNow let's create the nodes. Okay. So\nNow let's create the nodes. Okay. So these are the you can say schema. Let's\nthese are the you can say schema. Let's\nthese are the you can say schema. Let's add the metadata as well because\nyou'll be using this particular notebook\nyou'll be using this particular notebook for your node.\nfor your node.\nfor your node. create\nnode functions. Perfect. And now let's\nnode functions. Perfect. And now let's create the\nPerfect. So in order to create the state\nPerfect. So in order to create the state graph I'll simply say graph equals and I\ngraph I'll simply say graph equals and I\ngraph I'll simply say graph equals and I can import it first of all from lang\ncan import it first of all from lang\ncan import it first of all from lang graph\ngraph\ngraph dot graph\ndot graph\ndot graph import state graph\ngraph equals state graph\ngraph equals state graph and then I can simply write my graph\nand then I can simply write my graph\nand then I can simply write my graph schema.\nschema.\nschema. Perfect. And let's add the nodes. Now,\nPerfect. And let's add the nodes. Now,\nPerfect. And let's add the nodes. Now, this part is very important. Okay. Now,\nthis part is very important. Okay. Now,\nthis part is very important. Okay. Now, you need to create something very very\nyou need to create something very very\nyou need to create something very very very important. Add first of all nodes.\nvery important. Add first of all nodes.\nvery important. Add first of all nodes. Okay. The first node is graph add node\nOkay. The first node is graph add node\nOkay. The first node is graph add node lm node. The second node is tool node.\nlm node. The second node is tool node.\nlm node. The second node is tool node. Now, you need to stop here because we\nNow, you need to stop here because we\nNow, you need to stop here because we just need two nodes. Perfect. LM node is\njust need two nodes. Perfect. LM node is\njust need two nodes. Perfect. LM node is not defined. Very good. Why we have the\nnot defined. Very good. Why we have the\nnot defined. Very good. Why we have the LLM node? Oh, I think I didn't run this\nLLM node? Oh, I think I didn't run this\nLLM node? Oh, I think I didn't run this function.\nfunction.\nfunction. Perfect. So, my two nodes are done. Now,\nPerfect. So, my two nodes are done. Now,\nPerfect. So, my two nodes are done. Now, before creating the edges, you need to\nbefore creating the edges, you need to\nbefore creating the edges, you need to understand one very important concept\nunderstand one very important concept\nunderstand one very important concept here.\nhere.\nhere. Will you always make this tool call?\nWill you always make this tool call?\nWill you always make this tool call? Always. Obviously, no. I will only make\nAlways. Obviously, no. I will only make\nAlways. Obviously, no. I will only make this tool call when tool call is\nthis tool call when tool call is\nthis tool call when tool call is required. H very smart answer. Very\nrequired. H very smart answer. Very\nrequired. H very smart answer. Very good.\ngood.\ngood. Who will decide that? That when you\nWho will decide that? That when you\nWho will decide that? That when you should just make a tool call or not? um\nshould just make a tool call or not? um\nshould just make a tool call or not? um the response of openi because if it says\nthe response of openi because if it says\nthe response of openi because if it says tool call then obviously I need to just\ntool call then obviously I need to just\ntool call then obviously I need to just make tool call otherwise not exactly. So\nmake tool call otherwise not exactly. So\nmake tool call otherwise not exactly. So here instead of creating your normal\nhere instead of creating your normal\nhere instead of creating your normal edge you need to create a conditional\nedge you need to create a conditional\nedge you need to create a conditional edge. This is a conditional edge. This\nedge. This is a conditional edge. This\nedge. This is a conditional edge. This is not a normal edge. This is a\nis not a normal edge. This is a\nis not a normal edge. This is a conditional edge. That means it will\nconditional edge. That means it will\nconditional edge. That means it will only go to this node if this condition\nonly go to this node if this condition\nonly go to this node if this condition is satisfied. So whenever you want to\nis satisfied. So whenever you want to\nis satisfied. So whenever you want to create the conditional node in lang\ncreate the conditional node in lang\ncreate the conditional node in lang graph you always need to create a\ngraph you always need to create a\ngraph you always need to create a function for it. Okay. So let me just\nfunction for it. Okay. So let me just\nfunction for it. Okay. So let me just write here\ncreate conditional\ncreate conditional edge function. Simple. Now let's see how\nedge function. Simple. Now let's see how\nedge function. Simple. Now let's see how you can just create that. So I'll simply\nyou can just create that. So I'll simply\nyou can just create that. So I'll simply say df um if tool call.\nsay df um if tool call.\nsay df um if tool call. Okay. This is my function. So I'll\nOkay. This is my function. So I'll\nOkay. This is my function. So I'll simply say state graph and this takes a\nsimply say state graph and this takes a\nsimply say state graph and this takes a state graph and this returns let's say\nstate graph and this returns let's say\nstate graph and this returns let's say string. Simple. Yeah. because this will\nstring. Simple. Yeah. because this will\nstring. Simple. Yeah. because this will just return the string. So now I'll\njust return the string. So now I'll\njust return the string. So now I'll simply say message. Perfect. So now I\nsimply say message. Perfect. So now I\nsimply say message. Perfect. So now I will simply say if in is instance last\nwill simply say if in is instance last\nwill simply say if in is instance last message because I just want to fetch the\nmessage because I just want to fetch the\nmessage because I just want to fetch the last message. Okay. If it says tool\nlast message. Okay. If it says tool\nlast message. Okay. If it says tool message that means if there's a message\nmessage that means if there's a message\nmessage that means if there's a message called tool message then you can say\ncalled tool message then you can say\ncalled tool message then you can say return tool call otherwise no tool call.\nreturn tool call otherwise no tool call.\nreturn tool call otherwise no tool call. This is a very basic function that we\nThis is a very basic function that we\nThis is a very basic function that we have created. Simple. Okay. Now let me\nhave created. Simple. Okay. Now let me\nhave created. Simple. Okay. Now let me just ask you one one simple thing.\njust ask you one one simple thing.\njust ask you one one simple thing. Will you see the tool call object every\nWill you see the tool call object every\nWill you see the tool call object every time? Because obviously LLM does not\ntime? Because obviously LLM does not\ntime? Because obviously LLM does not create the tool call object. Okay. So\ncreate the tool call object. Okay. So\ncreate the tool call object. Okay. So what you can do it here just a quick you\nwhat you can do it here just a quick you\nwhat you can do it here just a quick you can say tip. You will simply say if\ncan say tip. You will simply say if\ncan say tip. You will simply say if um you can say last message dot tool\num you can say last message dot tool\num you can say last message dot tool calls. Okay. Because you will see tool\ncalls. Okay. Because you will see tool\ncalls. Okay. Because you will see tool calls object. If last message dot tool\ncalls object. If last message dot tool\ncalls object. If last message dot tool calls that means you have something in\ncalls that means you have something in\ncalls that means you have something in tool calls. Then if if there are some\ntool calls. Then if if there are some\ntool calls. Then if if there are some tool calls that means you need to go to\ntool calls that means you need to go to\ntool calls that means you need to go to tool node, right?\ntool node, right?\ntool node, right? tool node you need to write the node\ntool node you need to write the node\ntool node you need to write the node name. Okay. And if if you do not see any\nname. Okay. And if if you do not see any\nname. Okay. And if if you do not see any kind of tool calls, do you know what you\nkind of tool calls, do you know what you\nkind of tool calls, do you know what you need to do? Return end. Perfect. Return\nneed to do? Return end. Perfect. Return\nneed to do? Return end. Perfect. Return end. And you can just import it here as\nend. And you can just import it here as\nend. And you can just import it here as well.\nwell.\nwell. Simple return end. This is your\nSimple return end. This is your\nSimple return end. This is your conditional function. You do not need to\nconditional function. You do not need to\nconditional function. You do not need to return to any single node. You simply\nreturn to any single node. You simply\nreturn to any single node. You simply need to end the graph there.\nneed to end the graph there.\nneed to end the graph there. Make sense? Very good. Now just create\nMake sense? Very good. Now just create\nMake sense? Very good. Now just create the edges.\nthe edges.\nthe edges. Add edges between nodes. So first edges\nAdd edges between nodes. So first edges\nAdd edges between nodes. So first edges start to lm node. Very good. Now graph\nstart to lm node. Very good. Now graph\nstart to lm node. Very good. Now graph dot add edge lm node obviously. Then it\ndot add edge lm node obviously. Then it\ndot add edge lm node obviously. Then it will go to tool node. But this is not\nwill go to tool node. But this is not\nwill go to tool node. But this is not your simple edge. So you will simply say\nyour simple edge. So you will simply say\nyour simple edge. So you will simply say add\nadd\nadd conditional edges. Yes. And here you\nconditional edges. Yes. And here you\nconditional edges. Yes. And here you will write from which node you want to\nwill write from which node you want to\nwill write from which node you want to create the conditional edge? llm node\ncreate the conditional edge? llm node\ncreate the conditional edge? llm node and what is the decision factor behind\nand what is the decision factor behind\nand what is the decision factor behind it? It's a function called if tool call.\nit? It's a function called if tool call.\nit? It's a function called if tool call. Make sense?\nMake sense?\nMake sense? Make sense?\nMake sense?\nMake sense? I hope so.\nI hope so.\nI hope so. Okay. So, this is the function.\nOkay. So, this is the function.\nOkay. So, this is the function. Okay. Now, if it goes to if it goes to\nOkay. Now, if it goes to if it goes to\nOkay. Now, if it goes to if it goes to tool call then I need to attach the edge\ntool call then I need to attach the edge\ntool call then I need to attach the edge obviously then I will create the ed edge\nobviously then I will create the ed edge\nobviously then I will create the ed edge from tool node to lm node. Why? Because\nfrom tool node to lm node. Why? Because\nfrom tool node to lm node. Why? Because see the graph it needs to return the\nsee the graph it needs to return the\nsee the graph it needs to return the result back to LLM. So I will connect\nresult back to LLM. So I will connect\nresult back to LLM. So I will connect one edge from tool node to LLM. Right?\none edge from tool node to LLM. Right?\none edge from tool node to LLM. Right? Very good.\nVery good.\nVery good. And this is my third edge. Now I will\nAnd this is my third edge. Now I will\nAnd this is my third edge. Now I will attach fourth edge. Why? Because\nattach fourth edge. Why? Because\nattach fourth edge. Why? Because obviously we need to end our graph right\nobviously we need to end our graph right\nobviously we need to end our graph right from LM node to this thing. This is your\nfrom LM node to this thing. This is your\nfrom LM node to this thing. This is your graph. This is your graph. Let's try to\ngraph. This is your graph. Let's try to\ngraph. This is your graph. Let's try to see it. Let's try to compile it.\nsee it. Let's try to compile it.\nsee it. Let's try to compile it. Let's say react\nLet's say react\nLet's say react graph equals to graph.compile. And let\ngraph equals to graph.compile. And let\ngraph equals to graph.compile. And let me just bring that\nme just bring that\nme just bring that statement to visualize it.\nstatement to visualize it.\nstatement to visualize it. Uh here\nUh here\nUh here simple.\nsimple.\nsimple. Okay. Uh and this is called\nOkay. Uh and this is called\nOkay. Uh and this is called react graph. Simple. Now are you ready\nreact graph. Simple. Now are you ready\nreact graph. Simple. Now are you ready to see the\nOkay. Okay. So this is the advantage\nOkay. Okay. So this is the advantage when you just visualize the graph. So\nwhen you just visualize the graph. So\nwhen you just visualize the graph. So here the graph is there but it is not\nhere the graph is there but it is not\nhere the graph is there but it is not exactly correct. Why? Because start okay\nexactly correct. Why? Because start okay\nexactly correct. Why? Because start okay lm node okay end okay but this llm node\nlm node okay end okay but this llm node\nlm node okay end okay but this llm node is not completely connected to this tool\nis not completely connected to this tool\nis not completely connected to this tool node. There is no conditional edge here.\nnode. There is no conditional edge here.\nnode. There is no conditional edge here. That means something is missing.\nThat means something is missing.\nThat means something is missing. Something is missing. Okay let's try to\nSomething is missing. Okay let's try to\nSomething is missing. Okay let's try to um analyze it. So first is start to lm\num analyze it. So first is start to lm\num analyze it. So first is start to lm node. That is fine. The second is llm\nnode. That is fine. The second is llm\nnode. That is fine. The second is llm node to tool call right and this is the\nnode to tool call right and this is the\nnode to tool call right and this is the function called if tool call makes sense\nfunction called if tool call makes sense\nfunction called if tool call makes sense and we have also created the tool node\nand we have also created the tool node\nand we have also created the tool node that means it needs to go to the tool\nthat means it needs to go to the tool\nthat means it needs to go to the tool node and here is the problem because if\nnode and here is the problem because if\nnode and here is the problem because if you see um I think no the name is also\nyou see um I think no the name is also\nyou see um I think no the name is also fine tool node okay then I can say oh I\nfine tool node okay then I can say oh I\nfine tool node okay then I can say oh I see I have found the issue so the issue\nsee I have found the issue so the issue\nsee I have found the issue so the issue is I have used here the tool n with tool\nis I have used here the tool n with tool\nis I have used here the tool n with tool node with capital T and capital N but\nnode with capital T and capital N but\nnode with capital T and capital N but here the name is this one and here we\nhere the name is this one and here we\nhere the name is this one and here we are returning the tool node name so we\nare returning the tool node name so we\nare returning the tool node name so we do not return the function name so that\ndo not return the function name so that\ndo not return the function name so that is why you should always use the exact\nis why you should always use the exact\nis why you should always use the exact same name that you you just use for your\nsame name that you you just use for your\nsame name that you you just use for your function but I just relied on this l um\nfunction but I just relied on this l um\nfunction but I just relied on this l um AI suggestion so I was like okay let's\nAI suggestion so I was like okay let's\nAI suggestion so I was like okay let's go with it but yeah this was a easy fix\ngo with it but yeah this was a easy fix\ngo with it but yeah this was a easy fix so now let's try to\nso now let's try to\nso now let's try to recompile it okay still um or I just\nrecompile it okay still um or I just\nrecompile it okay still um or I just need to maybe say run all just be on the\nneed to maybe say run all just be on the\nneed to maybe say run all just be on the safer side. No. Okay, that means there's\nsafer side. No. Okay, that means there's\nsafer side. No. Okay, that means there's still something missing. Let's again\nstill something missing. Let's again\nstill something missing. Let's again assess it and let's see what is missing.\nassess it and let's see what is missing.\nassess it and let's see what is missing. So, let me now do one experiment. Okay,\nSo, let me now do one experiment. Okay,\nSo, let me now do one experiment. Okay, let's see if it works or not. So,\nlet's see if it works or not. So,\nlet's see if it works or not. So, usually what we do, we manually map this\nusually what we do, we manually map this\nusually what we do, we manually map this end. But in the previous versions, we\nend. But in the previous versions, we\nend. But in the previous versions, we were not supposed to map it. So, I think\nwere not supposed to map it. So, I think\nwere not supposed to map it. So, I think so it is due to that particular thing\nso it is due to that particular thing\nso it is due to that particular thing because I don't see any kind of error in\nbecause I don't see any kind of error in\nbecause I don't see any kind of error in this particular code. So what I will do\nthis particular code. So what I will do\nthis particular code. So what I will do I will simply write\nI will simply write\nI will simply write end here. Now as we know that if I write\nend here. Now as we know that if I write\nend here. Now as we know that if I write end here end is nothing right end is a\nend here end is nothing right end is a\nend here end is nothing right end is a node and it cannot be like written like\nnode and it cannot be like written like\nnode and it cannot be like written like this. I have to write it like this end.\nthis. I have to write it like this end.\nthis. I have to write it like this end. Right? But there's one more way to\nRight? But there's one more way to\nRight? But there's one more way to manually map it. So what I can do I can\nmanually map it. So what I can do I can\nmanually map it. So what I can do I can just simply create this function. Okay\njust simply create this function. Okay\njust simply create this function. Okay makes sense. And now if I just go to\nmakes sense. And now if I just go to\nmakes sense. And now if I just go to let's say conditional edge. So after\nlet's say conditional edge. So after\nlet's say conditional edge. So after conditional edge there's an optional\nconditional edge there's an optional\nconditional edge there's an optional dictionary that we can just pass like\ndictionary that we can just pass like\ndictionary that we can just pass like this. So I'll simply say tool node is\nthis. So I'll simply say tool node is\nthis. So I'll simply say tool node is mapped to the tool node name. Okay. And\nmapped to the tool node name. Okay. And\nmapped to the tool node name. Okay. And end is mapped to end.\nend is mapped to end.\nend is mapped to end. This was optional in the previous\nThis was optional in the previous\nThis was optional in the previous versions but I think so that this can be\nversions but I think so that this can be\nversions but I think so that this can be the fix. I'm not sure. Let's still see.\nthe fix. I'm not sure. Let's still see.\nthe fix. I'm not sure. Let's still see. Let me just say run all. Oh. Oh. Let me\nLet me just say run all. Oh. Oh.

Our react agent is ready, ready, ready. And as you can see, it is\nready, ready. And as you can see, it is\nready, ready. And as you can see, it is amazing.\namazing.\namazing. Right? So that's how you can create the\nRight? So that's how you can create the\nRight? So that's how you can create the react agent. Now let me show you what\nreact agent. Now let me show you what\nreact agent. Now let me show you what will happen. Let me just invoke\nwill happen. Let me just invoke\nwill happen. Let me just invoke something. Right?\nsomething. Right?\nsomething. Right? I will say\nI will say\nI will say uh markdown\nsimple. So now in order to invoke the\nsimple. So now in order to invoke the graph I will simply say um\ngraph I will simply say um\ngraph I will simply say um react graph dot invoke and I will simply\nreact graph dot invoke and I will simply\nreact graph dot invoke and I will simply say what is the latest news news on AI.\nsay what is the latest news news on AI.\nsay what is the latest news news on AI. Let's see what do we get. Let's see. And\nLet's see what do we get. Let's see. And\nLet's see what do we get. Let's see. And this is amazing by the way. Oh,\nthis is amazing by the way. Oh,\nthis is amazing by the way. Oh, structured tool object is not\nstructured tool object is not\nstructured tool object is not subscriptable\nsubscriptable\nsubscriptable during the task name tool node.

Oh, I see what is the issue. So, I have just used tool for\nissue. So, I have just used tool for\nissue. So, I have just used tool for both of the things. So, it has like\nboth of the things. So, it has like\nboth of the things. So, it has like actually overwritten this particular\nactually overwritten this particular\nactually overwritten this particular variable. So, let me just make it as\nvariable. So, let me just make it as\nvariable. So, let me just make it as let's say tool call and then tool call\nlet's say tool call and then tool call\nlet's say tool call and then tool call and then tool call. Just a typo.

This is how you can say\nstream method. This is how you can say better not better it depends like what\nbetter not better it depends like what\nbetter not better it depends like what you are trying to do. So you can just\nyou are trying to do. So you can just\nyou are trying to do. So you can just also invoke your code like this. Okay.\nalso invoke your code like this. Okay.\nalso invoke your code like this. Okay. And then you can simply pass the\nAnd then you can simply pass the\nAnd then you can simply pass the message. And then you also need to write\nmessage. And then you also need to write\nmessage. And then you also need to write one important thing which is called\none important thing which is called\none important thing which is called stream mode. Okay, stream mode. And here\nstream mode. Okay, stream mode. And here\nstream mode. Okay, stream mode. And here you will say\nyou will say\nyou will say stream mode equals to updates\nstream mode equals to updates\nstream mode equals to updates simple. And then here you can simply say\nsimple. And then here you can simply say\nsimple. And then here you can simply say print chunk. So I can just run this as\nprint chunk. So I can just run this as\nprint chunk. So I can just run this as well. So let's see what do we get after\nwell. So let's see what do we get after\nwell. So let's see what do we get after invoking this. Okay. So this cell is\ninvoking this. Okay. So this cell is\ninvoking this. Okay. So this cell is completed and this is like started\ncompleted and this is like started\ncompleted and this is like started running. So let's assess this one. Then\nrunning. So let's assess this one. Then\nrunning. So let's assess this one. Then we will just go to the next one. So here\nwe will just go to the next one. So here\nwe will just go to the next one. So here you can see that first of all we got the\nyou can see that first of all we got the\nyou can see that first of all we got the human message which is my query. Then AI\nhuman message which is my query. Then AI\nhuman message which is my query. Then AI message simply ask this question like\nmessage simply ask this question like\nmessage simply ask this question like hey um I do not have any content I will\nhey um I do not have any content I will\nhey um I do not have any content I will make tool call. Then it made the tool\nmake tool call. Then it made the tool\nmake tool call. Then it made the tool call. Right? So this is the this is the\ncall. Right? So this is the this is the\ncall. Right? So this is the this is the response from tool node. Then AI message\nresponse from tool node. Then AI message\nresponse from tool node. Then AI message again made a tool node because it was\nagain made a tool node because it was\nagain made a tool node because it was not satisfied with the response. Then\nnot satisfied with the response. Then\nnot satisfied with the response. Then again tool message and it made I think\nagain tool message and it made I think\nagain tool message and it made I think three tool calls. That's four. 1 2 3 4.\nthree tool calls. That's four. 1 2 3 4.\nthree tool calls. That's four. 1 2 3 4. And as you can see, I should see the\nAnd as you can see, I should see the\nAnd as you can see, I should see the response like tool calls. Let's see how\nresponse like tool calls. Let's see how\nresponse like tool calls. Let's see how many tool calls it actually demanded.\nmany tool calls it actually demanded.\nmany tool calls it actually demanded. And I can see tool calls\nAnd I can see tool calls\nAnd I can see tool calls in the yeah tool calls. So actually\nin the yeah tool calls. So actually\nin the yeah tool calls. So actually demanded like name s duck go search.\ndemanded like name s duck go search.\ndemanded like name s duck go search. Then it demanded another one. So yeah,\nThen it demanded another one. So yeah,\nThen it demanded another one. So yeah, it demanded all of these tool calls. So\nit demanded all of these tool calls. So\nit demanded all of these tool calls. So it made these tool calls 1 2 3 4 maybe\nit made these tool calls 1 2 3 4 maybe\nit made these tool calls 1 2 3 4 maybe with different prompts maybe with\nwith different prompts maybe with\nwith different prompts maybe with different tools whatever whatever that\ndifferent tools whatever whatever that\ndifferent tools whatever whatever that LLM model um thought at that moment that\nLLM model um thought at that moment that\nLLM model um thought at that moment that what tool call is required it made those\nwhat tool call is required it made those\nwhat tool call is required it made those to those tool calls basically not made\nto those tool calls basically not made\nto those tool calls basically not made tool calls it prepared the input for the\ntool calls it prepared the input for the\ntool calls it prepared the input for the tool call. Our tool node created the\ntool call. Our tool node created the\ntool call. Our tool node created the tool or basically made the tool calls.\ntool or basically made the tool calls.\ntool or basically made the tool calls. Then finally this AI message was\nThen finally this AI message was\nThen finally this AI message was satisfied with the tool messages and\nsatisfied with the tool messages and\nsatisfied with the tool messages and then it finally generated the final\nthen it finally generated the final\nthen it finally generated the final response using the news and whatever.\nresponse using the news and whatever.\nresponse using the news and whatever. Make sense? Wow. Now I will simply rerun\nMake sense? Wow. Now I will simply rerun\nMake sense? Wow. Now I will simply rerun this thing and you will see what will\nthis thing and you will see what will\nthis thing and you will see what will happen. So here\nhappen. So here\nhappen. So here it will show the results one by one\nit will show the results one by one\nit will show the results one by one because this is streaming. This is like\nbecause this is streaming. This is like\nbecause this is streaming. This is like kind of realtime stuff. See, so first of\nkind of realtime stuff. See, so first of\nkind of realtime stuff. See, so first of all, LLM node that means me. Okay, I\nall, LLM node that means me. Okay, I\nall, LLM node that means me. Okay, I passed this information as human\npassed this information as human\npassed this information as human message. LLM node generated this thing.\nmessage. LLM node generated this thing.\nmessage. LLM node generated this thing. Okay, then it made a tool node or\nOkay, then it made a tool node or\nOkay, then it made a tool node or basically you can a tool call. So it\nbasically you can a tool call. So it\nbasically you can a tool call. So it made this tool call and this it made and\nmade this tool call and this it made and\nmade this tool call and this it made and then it just simply generated the LM\nthen it just simply generated the LM\nthen it just simply generated the LM node. Here it only generated one tool\nnode. Here it only generated one tool\nnode. Here it only generated one tool node because maybe it only required one\nnode because maybe it only required one\nnode because maybe it only required one tool call this time. It totally depends\ntool call this time. It totally depends\ntool call this time. It totally depends like what does it think at that moment\nlike what does it think at that moment\nlike what does it think at that moment not think because LLM cannot think but\nnot think because LLM cannot think but\nnot think because LLM cannot think but yeah whatever it feels like\nyeah whatever it feels like\nyeah whatever it feels like lms cannot feel. Yeah. Yeah. You got my\nlms cannot feel. Yeah. Yeah. You got my\nlms cannot feel. Yeah. Yeah. You got my intent right. Okay. Very good. So this\nintent right. Okay. Very good. So this\nintent right. Okay. Very good. So this is all about your react framework or you\nis all about your react framework or you\nis all about your react framework or you can say building react aentic AI\ncan say building react aentic AI\ncan say building react aentic AI frameworks with the\nframeworks with the\nframeworks with the langraph. What is the difference between\nlangraph. What is the difference between\nlangraph. What is the difference between this and lang chain? You have full\nthis and lang chain? You have full\nthis and lang chain? You have full control right?\ncontrol right?\ncontrol right? You have full control. Very good. Now\nYou have full control. Very good. Now\nYou have full control. Very good. Now let's talk about the other framework\nlet's talk about the other framework\nlet's talk about the other framework available other than React because we\navailable other than React because we\navailable other than React because we have some amazing frameworks like\nhave some amazing frameworks like\nhave some amazing frameworks like obviously React is the best one but we\nobviously React is the best one but we\nobviously React is the best one but we still have like amazing frameworks\nstill have like amazing frameworks\nstill have like amazing frameworks available. Let me just show you what are\navailable. Let me just show you what are\navailable. Let me just show you what are the frameworks available. Go to langraph\nthe frameworks available. Go to langraph\nthe frameworks available. Go to langraph official documentation and here you will\nofficial documentation and here you will\nofficial documentation and here you will see workflows plus agents. So if I just\nsee workflows plus agents. So if I just\nsee workflows plus agents. So if I just expand it you will see one is prompt\nexpand it you will see one is prompt\nexpand it you will see one is prompt chaining. Prompt chaining is the one\nchaining. Prompt chaining is the one\nchaining. Prompt chaining is the one that you have already built. Okay, where\nthat you have already built. Okay, where\nthat you have already built. Okay, where you simply pass the call and you see the\nyou simply pass the call and you see the\nyou simply pass the call and you see the result and that's it. Parallelization is\nresult and that's it. Parallelization is\nresult and that's it. Parallelization is very important. Let's say you want to\nvery important. Let's say you want to\nvery important. Let's say you want to create a parallel workflow.\ncreate a parallel workflow.\ncreate a parallel workflow. Okay, where you just want to create\nOkay, where you just want to create\nOkay, where you just want to create let's say two branches. You can create\nlet's say two branches. You can create\nlet's say two branches. You can create parallel workflow as well in the\nparallel workflow as well in the\nparallel workflow as well in the langraph. Now let's try to create this\nlangraph. Now let's try to create this\nlangraph. Now let's try to create this thing. Okay, now let's try to build this\nthing. Okay, now let's try to build this\nthing. Okay, now let's try to build this thing and learn this thing one by one.\nthing and learn this thing one by one.\nthing and learn this thing one by one. Let me just copy this React agents and\nLet me just copy this React agents and\nLet me just copy this React agents and here I will say other workflows or you\nhere I will say other workflows or you\nhere I will say other workflows or you can say other important workflows\nor you can say workflows\nor you can say workflows okay\nokay\nokay because you just need to understand what\nbecause you just need to understand what\nbecause you just need to understand what are the workflows available in langraph\nare the workflows available in langraph\nare the workflows available in langraph and then you can just use your\nand then you can just use your\nand then you can just use your creativity and you can just build\ncreativity and you can just build\ncreativity and you can just build anything. First of all, we'll just talk\nanything. First of all, we'll just talk\nanything. First of all, we'll just talk about uh\nabout uh\nabout uh let's say\nand prompt chaining by the way is\nand prompt chaining by the way is already done. Okay, how because you\nalready done. Okay, how because you\nalready done. Okay, how because you created this particular you can say tool\ncreated this particular you can say tool\ncreated this particular you can say tool bounding and prompts and chains and\nbounding and prompts and chains and\nbounding and prompts and chains and messages and let's say when you just use\nmessages and let's say when you just use\nmessages and let's say when you just use a react agent, you automatically use the\na react agent, you automatically use the\na react agent, you automatically use the prompt chaining method. For example,\nprompt chaining method. For example,\nprompt chaining method. For example, let's say not even that one, let's say\nlet's say not even that one, let's say\nlet's say not even that one, let's say pantic one. So you build this graph.\npantic one. So you build this graph.\npantic one. So you build this graph. Let's say this one. So this is a kind of\nLet's say this one. So this is a kind of\nLet's say this one. So this is a kind of prompt chaining when you pass one prompt\nprompt chaining when you pass one prompt\nprompt chaining when you pass one prompt to one node, then second prompt to next\nto one node, then second prompt to next\nto one node, then second prompt to next node, then third prompt, then fourth\nnode, then third prompt, then fourth\nnode, then third prompt, then fourth prompt, then so on. So this is called\nprompt, then so on. So this is called\nprompt, then so on. So this is called prompt chaining when you can just\nprompt chaining when you can just\nprompt chaining when you can just connect multiple nodes one after other\nconnect multiple nodes one after other\nconnect multiple nodes one after other using the prompts using the text using\nusing the prompts using the text using\nusing the prompts using the text using the input.\nthe input.\nthe input. Make sense? But there are scenarios when\nMake sense? But there are scenarios when\nMake sense? But there are scenarios when you want to generate or basically you\nyou want to generate or basically you\nyou want to generate or basically you want to create the workflows in parallel\nwant to create the workflows in parallel\nwant to create the workflows in parallel very good example is let me just open my\nvery good example is let me just open my\nvery good example is let me just open my workboard workboard whiteboard\nworkboard workboard whiteboard\nworkboard workboard whiteboard whiteboard so let's say parallel\nwhiteboard so let's say parallel\nwhiteboard so let's say parallel um what was the name of it I want to use\num what was the name of it I want to use\num what was the name of it I want to use the exact name\nthe exact name\nthe exact name parallelization okay\nSo in the paralization and prompt\nSo in the paralization and prompt chaining is already done. Um you can\nchaining is already done. Um you can\nchaining is already done. Um you can just use any example. Let's say this\njust use any example. Let's say this\njust use any example. Let's say this one. This is also a kind of prompt\none. This is also a kind of prompt\none. This is also a kind of prompt chaining. Simple. This is also kind of\nchaining. Simple. This is also kind of\nchaining. Simple. This is also kind of prompt chaining.\nprompt chaining.\nprompt chaining. Now in the parallelization\nNow in the parallelization\nNow in the parallelization what you want to do you need to run\nwhat you want to do you need to run\nwhat you want to do you need to run nodes in parallel. Wow. Yes. You need to\nnodes in parallel. Wow. Yes. You need to\nnodes in parallel. Wow. Yes. You need to run the nodes in parallel. Let's say a\nrun the nodes in parallel. Let's say a\nrun the nodes in parallel. Let's say a very good example is\nvery good example is\nvery good example is let's say you are this developer okay\nlet's say you are this developer okay\nlet's say you are this developer okay and you want to run\none node for let's say one task okay and\none node for let's say one task okay and second node for the second task or let's\nsecond node for the second task or let's\nsecond node for the second task or let's say third node for the third task let's\nsay third node for the third task let's\nsay third node for the third task let's say\nsay\nsay and what task you can just build with\nand what task you can just build with\nand what task you can just build with this anything it's up to you. Let's say\nthis anything it's up to you. Let's say\nthis anything it's up to you. Let's say one task is let's let's take the same\none task is let's let's take the same\none task is let's let's take the same example. Let's say these three tasks are\nexample. Let's say these three tasks are\nexample. Let's say these three tasks are generating your posts. Okay, social\ngenerating your posts. Okay, social\ngenerating your posts. Okay, social media posts. Simple. The same way that\nmedia posts. Simple. The same way that\nmedia posts. Simple. The same way that it that we just worked before. Okay,\nit that we just worked before. Okay,\nit that we just worked before. Okay, makes sense. Let's say you want to just\nmakes sense. Let's say you want to just\nmakes sense. Let's say you want to just create these social media posts but in\ncreate these social media posts but in\ncreate these social media posts but in parallel. So let's say you have social\nparallel. So let's say you have social\nparallel. So let's say you have social handles on LinkedIn, um Insta, whatever.\nhandles on LinkedIn, um Insta, whatever.\nhandles on LinkedIn, um Insta, whatever. So you want to write a post on a\nSo you want to write a post on a\nSo you want to write a post on a specific topic but obviously um the tone\nspecific topic but obviously um the tone\nspecific topic but obviously um the tone the you can say um style is not the same\nthe you can say um style is not the same\nthe you can say um style is not the same for all the platforms but you want to\nfor all the platforms but you want to\nfor all the platforms but you want to automate this thing. So what you can do\nautomate this thing. So what you can do\nautomate this thing. So what you can do you can pick one topic and you can\nyou can pick one topic and you can\nyou can pick one topic and you can parallelly create three different posts\nparallelly create three different posts\nparallelly create three different posts for three different platforms. Yes in\nfor three different platforms. Yes in\nfor three different platforms. Yes in parallel. So let's say this is for\nparallel. So let's say this is for\nparallel. So let's say this is for Facebook.\nFacebook.\nFacebook. Okay. This is for let's say LinkedIn\nand this is for let's say um Insta and\nand this is for let's say um Insta and this is let's Twitter which is X. Okay.\nthis is let's Twitter which is X. Okay.\nthis is let's Twitter which is X. Okay. So you can just perform this thing in\nSo you can just perform this thing in\nSo you can just perform this thing in parallel using parallel workflow. Let me\nparallel using parallel workflow. Let me\nparallel using parallel workflow. Let me just show you how you can just do that.\njust show you how you can just do that.\njust show you how you can just do that. So if you go to\nSo if you go to\nSo if you go to let me just create a new\nlet me just create a new\nlet me just create a new uh yeah let's say let's create a new one\nuh yeah let's say let's create a new one\nuh yeah let's say let's create a new one okay and for this we do not need to\nokay and for this we do not need to\nokay and for this we do not need to create a react agent so it will be like\ncreate a react agent so it will be like\ncreate a react agent so it will be like very very simple and we do not even need\nvery very simple and we do not even need\nvery very simple and we do not even need to create tools because we are simply\nto create tools because we are simply\nto create tools because we are simply now\nnow\nnow learning more about the workflows right\nlearning more about the workflows right\nlearning more about the workflows right now you know tools react agent now we\nnow you know tools react agent now we\nnow you know tools react agent now we are just working more about uh you can\nare just working more about uh you can\nare just working more about uh you can say working more towards the workflows.\nsay working more towards the workflows.\nsay working more towards the workflows. So I will simply let's say copy this\nSo I will simply let's say copy this\nSo I will simply let's say copy this one.\none.\none. Let me just rename it.\nLet me just rename it.\nLet me just rename it. Let's say parallelization.\nLet's say parallelization.\nLet's say parallelization. Simple. So in the parallelization I will\nSimple. So in the parallelization I will\nSimple. So in the parallelization I will simply run this cell and let me just\nsimply run this cell and let me just\nsimply run this cell and let me just attach the virtual environment.\nattach the virtual environment.\nattach the virtual environment. Perfect. So now here I will define my\nPerfect. So now here I will define my\nPerfect. So now here I will define my pantic schema. identic schema or you can\npantic schema. identic schema or you can\npantic schema. identic schema or you can say a kind of\nsay a kind of\nsay a kind of um\num\num type schema. It's up to you like it's\ntype schema. It's up to you like it's\ntype schema. It's up to you like it's it's fine. Let's create the type schema.\nit's fine. Let's create the type schema.\nit's fine. Let's create the type schema. It's not a good it's not a big deal\nIt's not a good it's not a big deal\nIt's not a good it's not a big deal because now you know the stuff. So from\nbecause now you know the stuff. So from\nbecause now you know the stuff. So from typing\ntype and let's say list. So here I will\ntype and let's say list. So here I will define the class called\ngraph schema and type deck. And here I\ngraph schema and type deck. And here I will create the three different keys not\nwill create the three different keys not\nwill create the three different keys not three basically four. The first key will\nthree basically four. The first key will\nthree basically four. The first key will be topic\nbe topic\nbe topic which will be same. Then I will create\nwhich will be same. Then I will create\nwhich will be same. Then I will create one insta.\none insta.\none insta. Okay. This will be string then Twitter\nOkay. This will be string then Twitter\nOkay. This will be string then Twitter then LinkedIn. Simple. Yes. So this is\nthen LinkedIn. Simple. Yes. So this is\nthen LinkedIn. Simple. Yes. So this is my schema. So here I will say create\nmy schema. So here I will say create\nmy schema. So here I will say create post simple and here I will simply say\npost simple and here I will simply say\npost simple and here I will simply say create post and then\ncreate post and then\ncreate post and then let's say LinkedIn or let's say Insta\nlet's say LinkedIn or let's say Insta\nlet's say LinkedIn or let's say Insta simple very good so here I will say\nsimple very good so here I will say\nsimple very good so here I will say create an Instagram post about this\ncreate an Instagram post about this\ncreate an Instagram post about this thing okay and you can also add some\nthing okay and you can also add some\nthing okay and you can also add some instructions let's say keep the tone\ninstructions let's say keep the tone\ninstructions let's say keep the tone um casual ual and engaging because it's\num casual ual and engaging because it's\num casual ual and engaging because it's in stock right then you can write the\nin stock right then you can write the\nin stock right then you can write the same thing\nsame thing\nsame thing for\nlet's say Twitter\nlet's say Twitter and here I will say\nand here I will say\nand here I will say Twitter and Twitter Twitter Twitter and\nTwitter and Twitter Twitter Twitter and\nTwitter and Twitter Twitter Twitter and here you will say keep the tone not\nhere you will say keep the tone not\nhere you will say keep the tone not casual I will say keep the tone quick\ncasual I will say keep the tone quick\ncasual I will say keep the tone quick because on Twitter you cannot like write\nbecause on Twitter you cannot like write\nbecause on Twitter you cannot like write much so let's say quick\nmuch so let's say quick\nmuch so let's say quick Okay. Yep. Perfect. So now let's create\nOkay. Yep. Perfect. So now let's create\nOkay. Yep. Perfect. So now let's create the third node\nthe third node\nthe third node which is\nLinkedIn.\nLinkedIn. Simple. Very good.\nSimple. Very good.\nSimple. Very good. And you will say keep the tone\nAnd you will say keep the tone\nAnd you will say keep the tone professional and informative because it\nprofessional and informative because it\nprofessional and informative because it is LinkedIn. Perfect. So these are my\nis LinkedIn. Perfect. So these are my\nis LinkedIn. Perfect. So these are my three nodes. Let me just process it. Now\nthree nodes. Let me just process it. Now\nthree nodes. Let me just process it. Now what will I do? This is the magical area\nwhat will I do? This is the magical area\nwhat will I do? This is the magical area where I will just create the parallel\nwhere I will just create the parallel\nwhere I will just create the parallel nodes. So what I will do? I will first\nnodes. So what I will do? I will first\nnodes. So what I will do? I will first of all create all of my nodes. The first\nof all create all of my nodes. The first\nof all create all of my nodes. The first is create post Insta, Twitter, LinkedIn.\nis create post Insta, Twitter, LinkedIn.\nis create post Insta, Twitter, LinkedIn. Simple. And here\nSimple. And here\nSimple.

Used an annotated key to\nper step. Okay. Used an annotated key to handle. Oh, I see. I see what is like\nhandle. Oh, I see. I see what is like\nhandle. Oh, I see. I see what is like actually happening. So do you know what\nactually happening. So do you know what\nactually happening. So do you know what is happening right now? It is simply\nis happening right now? It is simply\nis happening right now? It is simply trying to update. So when we just simply\ntrying to update. So when we just simply\ntrying to update. So when we just simply uh returning something okay so it is\nuh returning something okay so it is\nuh returning something okay so it is simply trying to update the key the\nsimply trying to update the key the\nsimply trying to update the key the topic in you can say um parallel. Okay\ntopic in you can say um parallel. Okay\ntopic in you can say um parallel. Okay in parallel. So when you are simply\nin parallel. So when you are simply\nin parallel. So when you are simply returning anything in parallel it can\nreturning anything in parallel it can\nreturning anything in parallel it can create some conflict. So that is why it\ncreate some conflict. So that is why it\ncreate some conflict. So that is why it is simply saying if you want to um\nis simply saying if you want to um\nis simply saying if you want to um update anything in parallel you can just\nupdate anything in parallel you can just\nupdate anything in parallel you can just use annotated. Simple. So here what is a\nuse annotated. Simple. So here what is a\nuse annotated. Simple. So here what is a quick fix? First is you can create\nquick fix? First is you can create\nquick fix? First is you can create annotated of list. Let's say\nannotated of list. Let's say\nannotated of list. Let's say like this annotated\nlike this annotated\nlike this annotated and then string or whatever. Okay,\nand then string or whatever. Okay,\nand then string or whatever. Okay, because that can just simply change all\nbecause that can just simply change all\nbecause that can just simply change all of those things. And the better way the\nof those things. And the better way the\nof those things. And the better way the better way is instead of returning state\nbetter way is instead of returning state\nbetter way is instead of returning state that means instead of returning entire\nthat means instead of returning entire\nthat means instead of returning entire state because when you return the entire\nstate because when you return the entire\nstate because when you return the entire state that means you are trying to\nstate that means you are trying to\nstate that means you are trying to update the entire state. Even the value\nupdate the entire state. Even the value\nupdate the entire state. Even the value is same but logically you are returning\nis same but logically you are returning\nis same but logically you are returning the entire state. You can simply say\nthe entire state. You can simply say\nthe entire state. You can simply say return\nreturn\nreturn state of insta. That's it. So this way\nstate of insta. That's it. So this way\nstate of insta. That's it. So this way you are only updating the insta not the\nyou are only updating the insta not the\nyou are only updating the insta not the entire state. This is a quick fix for it\nentire state. This is a quick fix for it\nentire state. This is a quick fix for it and not quick fix quick knowledge\nand not quick fix quick knowledge\nand not quick fix quick knowledge transfer as well.\ntransfer as well.\ntransfer as well.

Let me just check because it returned something\njust check because it returned something\njust check because it returned something and it is saying expected dictionary got\nand it is saying expected dictionary got\nand it is saying expected dictionary got AI is no longer futuristic concepts.\nAI is no longer futuristic concepts.\nAI is no longer futuristic concepts. It's practice. Ooh, I think something is\nIt's practice. Ooh, I think something is\nIt's practice. Ooh, I think something is wrong. So it is saying okay topic is\nwrong. So it is saying okay topic is\nwrong. So it is saying okay topic is this one. Okay, makes sense. Install\nthis one. Okay, makes sense. Install\nthis one. Okay, makes sense. Install Twitter LinkedIn and it is saying that\nTwitter LinkedIn and it is saying that\nTwitter LinkedIn and it is saying that it failed at create LinkedIn. Okay.\nit failed at create LinkedIn. Okay.\nit failed at create LinkedIn. Okay. State of LinkedIn, state of topic. H\nState of LinkedIn, state of topic. H\nState of LinkedIn, state of topic. H interesting. Let me check. So the error\ninteresting. Let me check. So the error\ninteresting. Let me check. So the error is fixed within 2 minutes. Yeah. So the\nis fixed within 2 minutes. Yeah. So the\nis fixed within 2 minutes. Yeah. So the issue was same but the you can say fix\nissue was same but the you can say fix\nissue was same but the you can say fix was different. The issue was same like\nwas different. The issue was same like\nwas different. The issue was same like it was just updating the same key. So\nit was just updating the same key. So\nit was just updating the same key. So what I did I simply returned the\nwhat I did I simply returned the\nwhat I did I simply returned the dictionary only basically that key\ndictionary only basically that key\ndictionary only basically that key instead of returning the state. Make\ninstead of returning the state. Make\ninstead of returning the state. Make sense? So it fixed the issue and you can\nsense? So it fixed the issue and you can\nsense? So it fixed the issue and you can also say so intent is still the same. We\nalso say so intent is still the same. We\nalso say so intent is still the same. We simply want to update only the insta key\nsimply want to update only the insta key\nsimply want to update only the insta key or basically Twitter key or basically\nor basically Twitter key or basically\nor basically Twitter key or basically the LinkedIn key of that particular\nthe LinkedIn key of that particular\nthe LinkedIn key of that particular schema not the entire schema. But when I\nschema not the entire schema. But when I\nschema not the entire schema. But when I was just returning the state and then\nwas just returning the state and then\nwas just returning the state and then dictionary it was maybe like making some\ndictionary it was maybe like making some\ndictionary it was maybe like making some configs in parallel. This happens in\nconfigs in parallel. This happens in\nconfigs in parallel. This happens in parallel um execution. So now it is\nparallel um execution. So now it is\nparallel um execution. So now it is working fine. Absolutely. And as you can\nworking fine. Absolutely. And as you can\nworking fine. Absolutely. And as you can see your all the three posts are ready.\nsee your all the three posts are ready.\nsee your all the three posts are ready. See with different content and in\nSee with different content and in\nSee with different content and in parallel. These are not running in\nparallel. These are not running in\nparallel. These are not running in sequency.\nsequency.\nsequency. Very good. So this is all about the\nVery good. So this is all about the\nVery good. So this is all about the prompt chaining and parallelization.\nprompt chaining and parallelization.\nprompt chaining and parallelization. Now let's talk about the orchestrator\nNow let's talk about the orchestrator\nNow let's talk about the orchestrator worker. By the way, orchestrator worker\nworker. By the way, orchestrator worker\nworker. By the way, orchestrator worker is one of the most complex one. We will\nis one of the most complex one. We will\nis one of the most complex one. We will talk about it at the end. Okay. Now I\ntalk about it at the end. Okay. Now I\ntalk about it at the end. Okay. Now I want to talk about the evaluator\nwant to talk about the evaluator\nwant to talk about the evaluator optimizer. Okay, evaluator optimizer now\noptimizer. Okay, evaluator optimizer now\noptimizer. Okay, evaluator optimizer now or let's say before talking about\nor let's say before talking about\nor let's say before talking about evaluator optimizer I want to talk about\nevaluator optimizer I want to talk about\nevaluator optimizer I want to talk about routing because this is very important\nrouting because this is very important\nrouting because this is very important and very easy. So let's quickly cover\nand very easy. So let's quickly cover\nand very easy. So let's quickly cover this one routing. What do you understand\nthis one routing. What do you understand\nthis one routing. What do you understand by routing?\nby routing?\nby routing? Um\nUm\nUm routing means maybe let's say um a kind\nrouting means maybe let's say um a kind\nrouting means maybe let's say um a kind of route which can just divert the flow.\nof route which can just divert the flow.\nof route which can just divert the flow. Exactly. So when you have the flow like\nExactly. So when you have the flow like\nExactly. So when you have the flow like this, let's say\nthis, let's say\nthis, let's say routing.\nSo here what will happen? You will\nSo here what will happen? You will create let's say these three nodes as\ncreate let's say these three nodes as\ncreate let's say these three nodes as is. Okay. As is this. Now\nis. Okay. As is this. Now\nis. Okay. As is this. Now you will not take the decision. Okay.\nyou will not take the decision. Okay.\nyou will not take the decision. Okay. Now you will add basically you can say\nNow you will add basically you can say\nNow you will add basically you can say add a kind of route.\nadd a kind of route.\nadd a kind of route. Okay. Add basically kind of route. Now\nOkay. Add basically kind of route. Now\nOkay. Add basically kind of route. Now this route will decide in which\nthis route will decide in which\nthis route will decide in which direction we need to go. Wow. This is\ndirection we need to go. Wow. This is\ndirection we need to go. Wow. This is called router.\nMake sense? So let's say we have so many\nMake sense? So let's say we have so many nodes. We have three nodes. The nodes\nnodes. We have three nodes. The nodes\nnodes. We have three nodes. The nodes that we have created. But this time we\nthat we have created. But this time we\nthat we have created. But this time we want to involve a router to tell and to\nwant to involve a router to tell and to\nwant to involve a router to tell and to make the decision that whether it should\nmake the decision that whether it should\nmake the decision that whether it should go towards here towards here or towards\ngo towards here towards here or towards\ngo towards here towards here or towards here.\nhere.\nhere. Okay. And how we can just create this\nOkay. And how we can just create this\nOkay. And how we can just create this thing? See under the hood what is route\nthing? See under the hood what is route\nthing? See under the hood what is route or what is router? Just think about it.\nor what is router? Just think about it.\nor what is router? Just think about it. Just think about it. Under the hood\nJust think about it. Under the hood\nJust think about it. Under the hood router is nothing but just your\nrouter is nothing but just your\nrouter is nothing but just your conditional logic.\nconditional logic.\nconditional logic. the condition that you build.\nthe condition that you build.\nthe condition that you build. Um, yeah, kind of see kind of right. So\nUm, yeah, kind of see kind of right. So\nUm, yeah, kind of see kind of right. So now\nnow\nnow you need to build a kind of workflow\nyou need to build a kind of workflow\nyou need to build a kind of workflow which will actually take you towards\nwhich will actually take you towards\nwhich will actually take you towards only one node. So now let's try to apply\nonly one node. So now let's try to apply\nonly one node. So now let's try to apply this thing in practical so that we can\nthis thing in practical so that we can\nthis thing in practical so that we can actually learn about it like how we can\nactually learn about it like how we can\nactually learn about it like how we can just perform all of these things. Make\njust perform all of these things. Make\njust perform all of these things. Make sense? because then only we'll just\nsense? because then only we'll just\nsense? because then only we'll just understand it. Okay. So now in order to\nunderstand it. Okay. So now in order to\nunderstand it. Okay. So now in order to apply this router you need to learn one\napply this router you need to learn one\napply this router you need to learn one more concept and it's very interesting.\nmore concept and it's very interesting.\nmore concept and it's very interesting. Let's talk about it. So I will go to my\nLet's talk about it. So I will go to my\nLet's talk about it. So I will go to my VS code editor. Perfect. So now what I\nVS code editor. Perfect. So now what I\nVS code editor. Perfect. So now what I will do I will simply let's say\nwill do I will simply let's say\nwill do I will simply let's say uh clone this. Perfect. Rename\nuh clone this. Perfect. Rename\nuh clone this. Perfect. Rename let's say 8 and\nlet's say 8 and\nlet's say 8 and router.\nrouter.\nrouter. Here the requirement is very simple. I\nHere the requirement is very simple. I\nHere the requirement is very simple. I need to create either LinkedIn post,\nneed to create either LinkedIn post,\nneed to create either LinkedIn post, um, Instagram post or whatever post.\num, Instagram post or whatever post.\num, Instagram post or whatever post. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. But now\nBut now\nBut now I will not tell LLM beforehand. I will\nI will not tell LLM beforehand. I will\nI will not tell LLM beforehand. I will not tell. I will just write my message\nnot tell. I will just write my message\nnot tell. I will just write my message on its own. Okay. And then LLM should be\non its own. Okay. And then LLM should be\non its own. Okay. And then LLM should be able to\nable to\nable to find the intent like what exactly I need\nfind the intent like what exactly I need\nfind the intent like what exactly I need to do. And this is the concept that\nto do. And this is the concept that\nto do. And this is the concept that takes us towards the direction of\ntakes us towards the direction of\ntakes us towards the direction of structured output\nstructured output\nstructured output because LLM can generate answers on its\nbecause LLM can generate answers on its\nbecause LLM can generate answers on its own so far. But now we have a concept\nown so far. But now we have a concept\nown so far. But now we have a concept called structured output. Same way LLM\ncalled structured output. Same way LLM\ncalled structured output. Same way LLM dot with bind tools. Okay. Similarly, we\ndot with bind tools. Okay. Similarly, we\ndot with bind tools. Okay. Similarly, we can also you can say make our LLM\ncan also you can say make our LLM\ncan also you can say make our LLM powerful enough to only generate the\npowerful enough to only generate the\npowerful enough to only generate the response with a specific schema.\nresponse with a specific schema.\nresponse with a specific schema. Okay, it's called with structured\nOkay, it's called with structured\nOkay, it's called with structured output. Okay, with structured output,\noutput. Okay, with structured output,\noutput. Okay, with structured output, you simply need to use it. So, first of\nyou simply need to use it. So, first of\nyou simply need to use it. So, first of all, what I will do, I will create that\nall, what I will do, I will create that\nall, what I will do, I will create that schema. So, here I do not need to use\nschema. So, here I do not need to use\nschema. So, here I do not need to use pyentic schema. Okay, I will change here\npyentic schema. Okay, I will change here\npyentic schema. Okay, I will change here as well\nas well\nas well because this is not pyic schema. Let's\nbecause this is not pyic schema. Let's\nbecause this is not pyic schema. Let's say just schema. Perfect.\nsay just schema. Perfect.\nsay just schema. Perfect. So here\nSo here\nSo here I will go to pyic schema because this is\nI will go to pyic schema because this is\nI will go to pyic schema because this is my pyic schema that I want to create\nmy pyic schema that I want to create\nmy pyic schema that I want to create simple. So here in the pyentic schema or\nsimple. So here in the pyentic schema or\nsimple. So here in the pyentic schema or you can say llm\nyou can say llm\nyou can say llm pyntic schema because this is just for\npyntic schema because this is just for\npyntic schema because this is just for the llm. Here I will say from\nthe llm. Here I will say from\nthe llm. Here I will say from pentic import based model and just be\npentic import based model and just be\npentic import based model and just be with me this is like a little bit\nwith me this is like a little bit\nwith me this is like a little bit complex but it is very very handy and\ncomplex but it is very very handy and\ncomplex but it is very very handy and very helpful. So let's say class um this\nvery helpful. So let's say class um this\nvery helpful. So let's say class um this is LLM schema not the graph schema lm\nis LLM schema not the graph schema lm\nis LLM schema not the graph schema lm schema here I will say topic and string\nschema here I will say topic and string\nschema here I will say topic and string and do you know what do you know what I\nand do you know what do you know what I\nand do you know what do you know what I will not use topic and just as random\nwill not use topic and just as random\nwill not use topic and just as random string I will pass on some rules I will\nstring I will pass on some rules I will\nstring I will pass on some rules I will say I want topic is of literal data type\nsay I want topic is of literal data type\nsay I want topic is of literal data type literal means only these values should\nliteral means only these values should\nliteral means only these values should be allowed first of all in up then\nbe allowed first of all in up then\nbe allowed first of all in up then Twitter then LinkedIn simple and I can\nTwitter then LinkedIn simple and I can\nTwitter then LinkedIn simple and I can import from typing import literal do you\nimport from typing import literal do you\nimport from typing import literal do you know what now if I just\nknow what now if I just\nknow what now if I just um you can say pick this llm okay it\num you can say pick this llm okay it\num you can say pick this llm okay it will only generate the answer with this\nwill only generate the answer with this\nwill only generate the answer with this key called topic let me just show you so\nkey called topic let me just show you so\nkey called topic let me just show you so I will say um and I can also pass some\nI will say um and I can also pass some\nI will say um and I can also pass some description because it doesn't make any\ndescription because it doesn't make any\ndescription because it doesn't make any sense like what is this literal what is\nsense like what is this literal what is\nsense like what is this literal what is this choice or what is this list right\nthis choice or what is this list right\nthis choice or what is this list right so I can literally say\nso I can literally say\nso I can literally say field and after lit I will say field and\nfield and after lit I will say field and\nfield and after lit I will say field and description is topic for which to\ndescription is topic for which to\ndescription is topic for which to generate the post. Very good. Now if I\ngenerate the post. Very good. Now if I\ngenerate the post. Very good. Now if I just call this LLM okay which LLM that\njust call this LLM okay which LLM that\njust call this LLM okay which LLM that I'm just going to create. So LLM\nI'm just going to create.

For example, currently we are\nwell. For example, currently we are simply finding the topic, right? Like\nsimply finding the topic, right? Like\nsimply finding the topic, right? Like which topic you want to use or whatever.\nwhich topic you want to use or whatever.\nwhich topic you want to use or whatever. Let's say I will change it to category.\nLet's say I will change it to category.\nLet's say I will change it to category. Okay, I will change it to category.\nOkay, I will change it to category.\nOkay, I will change it to category. Simple. And here I will say generate one\nSimple. And here I will say generate one\nSimple. And here I will say generate one topic as well.\ntopic as well.\ntopic as well. topic topic of the post to generate.\ntopic topic of the post to generate.\ntopic topic of the post to generate. Simple. Now let's see what it will\nSimple. Now let's see what it will\nSimple. Now let's see what it will return.\nreturn.\nreturn. So it will automatically curate the\nSo it will automatically curate the\nSo it will automatically curate the topic which can be easily\ntopic which can be easily\ntopic which can be easily be used by LLM to generate something.\nbe used by LLM to generate something.\nbe used by LLM to generate something. This is a kind of you can say query\nThis is a kind of you can say query\nThis is a kind of you can say query curation. We are just learning very deep\ncuration. We are just learning very deep\ncuration. We are just learning very deep concepts but this is important for you.\nconcepts but this is important for you.\nconcepts but this is important for you. Okay. So one thing is like just\nOkay. So one thing is like just\nOkay. So one thing is like just scratching the surface. Other thing is\nscratching the surface. Other thing is\nscratching the surface. Other thing is going deeper and learn the real skills.\ngoing deeper and learn the real skills.\ngoing deeper and learn the real skills. So we are learning the real skills. So\nSo we are learning the real skills. So\nSo we are learning the real skills. So as you can see category topic uh\nas you can see category topic uh\nas you can see category topic uh category Twitter topic is perfect\ncategory Twitter topic is perfect\ncategory Twitter topic is perfect perfect see that's how we can just work\nperfect see that's how we can just work\nperfect see that's how we can just work with the query curation simple very good\nwith the query curation simple very good\nwith the query curation simple very good this also saves the tokens right real\nthis also saves the tokens right real\nthis also saves the tokens right real world real world lessons okay\nworld real world lessons okay\nworld real world lessons okay so now we have this particular thing\nso now we have this particular thing\nso now we have this particular thing create post insta create post Twitter\ncreate post insta create post Twitter\ncreate post insta create post Twitter create post LinkedIn very good now I\ncreate post LinkedIn very good now I\ncreate post LinkedIn very good now I need to create one node which will be\nneed to create one node which will be\nneed to create one node which will be the decider node so I will say df F\nthe decider node so I will say df F\nthe decider node so I will say df F decider node. Now this node what this\ndecider node. Now this node what this\ndecider node. Now this node what this node will do let me just tell you. So\nnode will do let me just tell you. So\nnode will do let me just tell you. So this node will first of all take the you\nthis node will first of all take the you\nthis node will first of all take the you can say user input or as a state\ncan say user input or as a state\ncan say user input or as a state simple. So I need to take this input uh\nsimple. So I need to take this input uh\nsimple. So I need to take this input uh let's say input. Now in this input I\nlet's say input. Now in this input I\nlet's say input. Now in this input I will pass it to what? LLM, right? And\nwill pass it to what? LLM, right? And\nwill pass it to what? LLM, right? And which LLM? LLM with schema. Very good. I\nwhich LLM? LLM with schema. Very good. I\nwhich LLM? LLM with schema. Very good. I wanted to see like if you are just\nwanted to see like if you are just\nwanted to see like if you are just following along. LLM schema. Simple.\nfollowing along. LLM schema. Simple.\nfollowing along. LLM schema. Simple. Then you can say dot invoke and user\nThen you can say dot invoke and user\nThen you can say dot invoke and user input.\ninput.\ninput. Simple. And then dot category. Why dot\nSimple. And then dot category. Why dot\nSimple. And then dot category. Why dot category? Just tell me why dot category?\ncategory? Just tell me why dot category?\ncategory? Just tell me why dot category? Because this is a pentic object.\nPentic object.\nPentic object. Simple. You can say pyantic object. It's\nSimple. You can say pyantic object. It's\nSimple. You can say pyantic object. It's enough. So now you have the category.\nenough. So now you have the category.\nenough. So now you have the category. Now you can update the category, right?\nNow you can update the category, right?\nNow you can update the category, right? Update it. Simple. Simple. Over. It's\nUpdate it. Simple. Simple. Over. It's\nUpdate it. Simple. Simple. Over. It's done. Return state.\ndone. Return state.\ndone. Return state. Simple. Now what will happen? Now what\nSimple. Now what will happen? Now what\nSimple. Now what will happen? Now what will happen? We have the state ready and\nwill happen? We have the state ready and\nwill happen? We have the state ready and we have got which category we need to\nwe have got which category we need to\nwe have got which category we need to pick. Right? And these are the nodes.\npick. Right? And these are the nodes.\npick. Right? And these are the nodes. Let's create the nodes. So I will simply\nLet's create the nodes. So I will simply\nLet's create the nodes. So I will simply run this function. All the functions\nrun this function. All the functions\nrun this function. All the functions graph schema is not defined. Okay. Let\ngraph schema is not defined. Okay. Let\ngraph schema is not defined. Okay. Let me just run that as well.\nme just run that as well.\nme just run that as well. Okay. So this is also done. Now we\nOkay. So this is also done. Now we\nOkay. So this is also done. Now we simply need to create the schema or\nsimply need to create the schema or\nsimply need to create the schema or basically not schema like state graph\nbasically not schema like state graph\nbasically not schema like state graph right. So here I will simply get rid of\nright. So here I will simply get rid of\nright. So here I will simply get rid of these things first of all and let's try\nthese things first of all and let's try\nthese things first of all and let's try to create the add node. First of all, I\nto create the add node. First of all, I\nto create the add node. First of all, I will say add node, decider node, create\nwill say add node, decider node, create\nwill say add node, decider node, create install, create post for Twitter,\ninstall, create post for Twitter,\ninstall, create post for Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever. These are the major\nLinkedIn, whatever. These are the major\nLinkedIn, whatever. These are the major nodes. Now, if you just look at our\nnodes. Now, if you just look at our\nnodes. Now, if you just look at our requirements, this will be the\nrequirements, this will be the\nrequirements, this will be the conditional edge, right? Let me just\nconditional edge, right? Let me just\nconditional edge, right? Let me just make it dotted. These will be the\nmake it dotted. These will be the\nmake it dotted. These will be the conditional edges, not the direct edges\nconditional edges, not the direct edges\nconditional edges, not the direct edges because you cannot run all of the edges.\nbecause you cannot run all of the edges.\nbecause you cannot run all of the edges. This will be conditional. So, let's try\nThis will be conditional. So, let's try\nThis will be conditional. So, let's try to write the logic for the condition.\nto write the logic for the condition.\nto write the logic for the condition. Right? So, here what what will I do? I\nRight? So, here what what will I do? I\nRight? So, here what what will I do? I will create a new function. I will say\nwill create a new function. I will say\nwill create a new function. I will say df\ndf\ndf condition.\ncondition.\ncondition. Okay. And then I will not boolean\nOkay. And then I will not boolean\nOkay. And then I will not boolean basically. I will simply say um string\nbasically. I will simply say um string\nbasically. I will simply say um string simple. And now you have built the react\nsimple. And now you have built the react\nsimple. And now you have built the react agent. So now you know how to do it. So\nagent. So now you know how to do it. So\nagent. So now you know how to do it. So you simply fetch the category. Okay. And\nyou simply fetch the category. Okay. And\nyou simply fetch the category. Okay. And perfect. So if the category is insta\nperfect. So if the category is insta\nperfect. So if the category is insta then go to create post insta create post\nthen go to create post insta create post\nthen go to create post insta create post Twitter or create post LinkedIn. Simple.\nTwitter or create post LinkedIn. Simple.\nTwitter or create post LinkedIn. Simple. You know what we are doing right now\nYou know what we are doing right now\nYou know what we are doing right now because you know how we build the react\nbecause you know how we build the react\nbecause you know how we build the react agent. what is a condition right very\nagent. what is a condition right very\nagent. what is a condition right very good very good so now let's try to write\ngood very good so now let's try to write\ngood very good so now let's try to write the edge so first will be decider edge\nthe edge so first will be decider edge\nthe edge so first will be decider edge like decider node start to decider then\nlike decider node start to decider then\nlike decider node start to decider then graph dot add edge decider not decider\ngraph dot add edge decider not decider\ngraph dot add edge decider not decider basically now add conditional edge\nbasically now add conditional edge\nbasically now add conditional edge because now conditional edges will be\nbecause now conditional edges will be\nbecause now conditional edges will be coming into the picture right so this is\ncoming into the picture right so this is\ncoming into the picture right so this is decider\ndecider\ndecider and decider just the name of it okay I\nand decider just the name of it okay I\nand decider just the name of it okay I can also say condition just to stay\ncan also say condition just to stay\ncan also say condition just to stay consistent\nconsistent\nconsistent Okay condition and this will be my\nOkay condition and this will be my\nOkay condition and this will be my condition function that I have built\ncondition function that I have built\ncondition function that I have built right I do not need to apply mapping\nright I do not need to apply mapping\nright I do not need to apply mapping because I'm not applying any kind of\nbecause I'm not applying any kind of\nbecause I'm not applying any kind of mapping there so that is fine simple\nmapping there so that is fine simple\nmapping there so that is fine simple good so here once we have the\ngood so here once we have the\ngood so here once we have the conditional edge then I will say graph\nconditional edge then I will say graph\nconditional edge then I will say graph dot add edge\ndot add edge\ndot add edge and I want to create an edge from\nand I want to create an edge from\nand I want to create an edge from condition not condition basically from\ncondition not condition basically from\ncondition not condition basically from decider right see so decider node is\ndecider right see so decider node is\ndecider right see so decider node is here oh where's the decider node Decider\nhere oh where's the decider node Decider\nhere oh where's the decider node Decider node is here. Now we need to make sure\nnode is here. Now we need to make sure\nnode is here. Now we need to make sure that this this decider node will be\nthat this this decider node will be\nthat this this decider node will be connected to this one, this one and this\nconnected to this one, this one and this\nconnected to this one, this one and this one. Simple. Okay. So let's try to build\none. Simple. Okay. So let's try to build\none. Simple. Okay. So let's try to build that. So decider\nthat. So decider\nthat. So decider to you can say create\nLinkedIn simple and graph added this one\nLinkedIn simple and graph added this one and then same thing end end because you\nand then same thing end end because you\nand then same thing end end because you also need to end it simple very good so\nalso need to end it simple very good so\nalso need to end it simple very good so that is it finally and now I can simply\nthat is it finally and now I can simply\nthat is it finally and now I can simply run this thing this graph by compiling\nrun this thing this graph by compiling\nrun this thing this graph by compiling it simple so Let's say\nit simple so Let's say\nit simple so Let's say route graph. I know this was like\nroute graph. I know this was like\nroute graph. I know this was like complex one but I want you to learn\ncomplex one but I want you to learn\ncomplex one but I want you to learn complex thing. Everyone knows the basic\ncomplex thing. Everyone knows the basic\ncomplex thing. Everyone knows the basic stuff. This is the thing that you need\nstuff. This is the thing that you need\nstuff. This is the thing that you need to learn. Simple\nto learn. Simple\nto learn. Simple graph.compile\ngraph.compile\ngraph.compile because it if it would be so easy\nbecause it if it would be so easy\nbecause it if it would be so easy everyone would have done that right\neveryone would have done that right\neveryone would have done that right right. So let's try to run this.\nright. So let's try to run this.\nright. So let's try to run this. So condition is not defined obviously\nSo condition is not defined obviously\nSo condition is not defined obviously because we didn't run this function.\nbecause we didn't run this function.\nbecause we didn't run this function. Let's run this function and let's run\nLet's run this function and let's run\nLet's run this function and let's run this found edge starting at unknown node\nthis found edge starting at unknown node\nthis found edge starting at unknown node create post Twitter.

See AI recommendation.\nAI recommendation.\nAI recommendation. So you should be smart enough. Wow. So\nSo you should be smart enough. Wow. So\nSo you should be smart enough. Wow. So this actually worked fine. Now you can\nthis actually worked fine. Now you can\nthis actually worked fine. Now you can see that our decider node okay is\nsee that our decider node okay is\nsee that our decider node okay is connected to Insta, LinkedIn, Twitter\nconnected to Insta, LinkedIn, Twitter\nconnected to Insta, LinkedIn, Twitter and then all are going to end. Simple.\nand then all are going to end. Simple.\nand then all are going to end. Simple. I know this was a big one, but you\nI know this was a big one, but you\nI know this was a big one, but you finally did it. That's a very good\nfinally did it. That's a very good\nfinally did it. That's a very good thing. Okay, that's good. So now\nthing. Okay, that's good. So now\nthing. Okay, that's good. So now you can do one more optimization. If you\nyou can do one more optimization. If you\nyou can do one more optimization. If you just look at the graph, you are seeing\njust look at the graph, you are seeing\njust look at the graph, you are seeing the solid lines instead of dotted lines.\nthe solid lines instead of dotted lines.\nthe solid lines instead of dotted lines. Do you know why? You know the answer.\nDo you know why? You know the answer.\nDo you know why? You know the answer. That's why I written it. That's why I\nThat's why I written it. That's why I\nThat's why I written it. That's why I wrote it here so that you can just\nwrote it here so that you can just\nwrote it here so that you can just understand it. If I say add edge and if\nunderstand it. If I say add edge and if\nunderstand it. If I say add edge and if I if I'm just creating the solid edge\nI if I'm just creating the solid edge\nI if I'm just creating the solid edge obviously it will create the solid edge.\nobviously it will create the solid edge.\nobviously it will create the solid edge. It it will not remain like a conditional\nIt it will not remain like a conditional\nIt it will not remain like a conditional edge. So you do not need to create any\nedge. So you do not need to create any\nedge. So you do not need to create any edge from decider because that logic is\nedge from decider because that logic is\nedge from decider because that logic is already handled here. That logic is\nalready handled here. That logic is\nalready handled here. That logic is already routing it here. Make sense? Let\nalready routing it here. Make sense? Let\nalready routing it here. Make sense? Let me just rerun it. Now you should see the\nme just rerun it. Now you should see the\nme just rerun it. Now you should see the dotted lines. Wow, it has removed\ndotted lines. Wow, it has removed\ndotted lines. Wow, it has removed something. Wait uh decider instead. Let\nsomething. Wait uh decider instead. Let\nsomething. Wait uh decider instead. Let me just see what did we actually\nme just see what did we actually\nme just see what did we actually removed. Maybe we removed some extra\nremoved. Maybe we removed some extra\nremoved. Maybe we removed some extra stuff. I think everything is fine. It's\nstuff. I think everything is fine. It's\nstuff. I think everything is fine.

I think they have actually made this\nI think they have actually made this\nI think they have actually made this particular change for all of the\nparticular change for all of the\nparticular change for all of the mappings. It was not there before but we\nmappings. It was not there before but we\nmappings. It was not there before but we do not actually need to worry. So the\ndo not actually need to worry. So the\ndo not actually need to worry. So the same thing that we saw in the react\nsame thing that we saw in the react\nsame thing that we saw in the react agent thing. So we have to provide the\nagent thing. So we have to provide the\nagent thing. So we have to provide the mapping like this earlier when we used\nmapping like this earlier when we used\nmapping like this earlier when we used to work with the previous versions it\nto work with the previous versions it\nto work with the previous versions it was optional like we can provide the\nwas optional like we can provide the\nwas optional like we can provide the mapping. So yeah this is the thing. So I\nmapping. So yeah this is the thing. So I\nmapping. So yeah this is the thing. So I can also check the documentation but it\ncan also check the documentation but it\ncan also check the documentation but it is not written there. So earlier when we\nis not written there. So earlier when we\nis not written there. So earlier when we didn't have this particular upgrade so\ndidn't have this particular upgrade so\ndidn't have this particular upgrade so if we just write the exact node name it\nif we just write the exact node name it\nif we just write the exact node name it was working fine like you do not need to\nwas working fine like you do not need to\nwas working fine like you do not need to again mention it in the mapping but I\nagain mention it in the mapping but I\nagain mention it in the mapping but I think they have just made it\nthink they have just made it\nthink they have just made it mandatory but it's fine it's their\nmandatory but it's fine it's their\nmandatory but it's fine it's their package whatever they want to do it's\npackage whatever they want to do it's\npackage whatever they want to do it's done we are developers we know how to\ndone we are developers we know how to\ndone we are developers we know how to debug and that's it okay so this is done\ndebug and that's it okay so this is done\ndebug and that's it okay so this is done by the way so you have created this\nby the way so you have created this\nby the way so you have created this dotted lines okay and this is your graph\ndotted lines okay and this is your graph\ndotted lines okay and this is your graph so now what will happen if you just want\nso now what will happen if you just want\nso now what will happen if you just want to run it And if you want to let's say\nto run it And if you want to let's say\nto run it And if you want to let's say invoke it with\ninvoke it with\ninvoke it with the initial input and the input you will\nthe initial input and the input you will\nthe initial input and the input you will simply say I want to generate a post for\nsimply say I want to generate a post for\nsimply say I want to generate a post for Twitter about AI. Simple rest of the\nTwitter about AI. Simple rest of the\nTwitter about AI. Simple rest of the things will be automatically generated\nthings will be automatically generated\nthings will be automatically generated obviously. So you do not need to pass\nobviously. So you do not need to pass\nobviously. So you do not need to pass any kind of topic. Why? Because AI will\nany kind of topic. Why? Because AI will\nany kind of topic. Why? Because AI will do it. Then you can say category\ndo it. Then you can say category\ndo it. Then you can say category and category will be again empty.\nand category will be again empty.\nand category will be again empty. Perfect.\nPerfect.\nPerfect. Make sense. And then post.\nPerfect. Now let's try to invoke it and\nPerfect.

So,\nCC mistakes in this particular code. So,\nCC mistakes in this particular code. So, I have just fixed it quickly. So, first\nI have just fixed it quickly. So, first\nI have just fixed it quickly. So, first of all, we used LLM schema instead of\nof all, we used LLM schema instead of\nof all, we used LLM schema instead of LLM with schema and we wanted to use LLM\nLLM with schema and we wanted to use LLM\nLLM with schema and we wanted to use LLM with schema obviously. So, just a typo.\nwith schema obviously. So, just a typo.\nwith schema obviously. So, just a typo. Second thing if you just notice one\nSecond thing if you just notice one\nSecond thing if you just notice one thing we forgot to pick the topic from\nthing we forgot to pick the topic from\nthing we forgot to pick the topic from that particular\nthat particular\nthat particular response which is a common sense right\nresponse which is a common sense right\nresponse which is a common sense right so we forgot that as well so I just\nso we forgot that as well so I just\nso we forgot that as well so I just simply added it and now it is absolutely\nsimply added it and now it is absolutely\nsimply added it and now it is absolutely good absolutely amazing I haven't run\ngood absolutely amazing I haven't run\ngood absolutely amazing I haven't run this code but I wanted to show you\nthis code but I wanted to show you\nthis code but I wanted to show you before running the code because I was\nbefore running the code because I was\nbefore running the code because I was seeing that error and one more thing I\nseeing that error and one more thing I\nseeing that error and one more thing I have also returned the post instead of\nhave also returned the post instead of\nhave also returned the post instead of returning the LinkedIn and blah blah\nreturning the LinkedIn and blah blah\nreturning the LinkedIn and blah blah blah because as you know in the\nblah because as you know in the\nblah because as you know in the parallelization we had um this install\nparallelization we had um this install\nparallelization we had um this install LinkedIn Twitter But in the router we\nLinkedIn Twitter But in the router we\nLinkedIn Twitter But in the router we have only the post the same post you can\nhave only the post the same post you can\nhave only the post the same post you can say the key right.

So let me just run it in front of you so that you can also see\nin front of you so that you can also see\nin front of you so that you can also see um yeah let's wait for it to run and\num yeah let's wait for it to run and\num yeah let's wait for it to run and complete. So now let's wait and see if\ncomplete. So now let's wait and see if\ncomplete. So now let's wait and see if our error is gone and meanwhile we can\nour error is gone and meanwhile we can\nour error is gone and meanwhile we can just talk about the other frameworks as\njust talk about the other frameworks as\njust talk about the other frameworks as well other styles so you can say other\nwell other styles so you can say other\nwell other styles so you can say other kinds of frameworks. So this is this\nkinds of frameworks. So this is this\nkinds of frameworks. So this is this one. So now we'll be just looking at\none. So now we'll be just looking at\none.

Orchestrator worker and this will just test your\nthis will just test your\nthis will just test your multi-threading, Python multi-threading\nmulti-threading, Python multi-threading\nmulti-threading, Python multi-threading skills. Don't worry, we will just talk\nskills. Don't worry, we will just talk\nskills. Don't worry, we will just talk about it. And by the way, this ran fine.\nabout it. And by the way, this ran fine.\nabout it. And by the way, this ran fine. Very good. Very good. Very good. So\nVery good. Very good. Very good. So\nVery good. Very good. Very good. So yeah, there was some silly mistakes in\nyeah, there was some silly mistakes in\nyeah, there was some silly mistakes in this particular code. So if you're just\nthis particular code. So if you're just\nthis particular code. So if you're just watching this particular segment, so\nwatching this particular segment, so\nwatching this particular segment, so just make sure you are using the my\njust make sure you are using the my\njust make sure you are using the my updated notebook or you can say Python\nupdated notebook or you can say Python\nupdated notebook or you can say Python Jupyter notebook which is updated here.\nJupyter notebook which is updated here.\nJupyter notebook which is updated here. So there are some silly mistakes, okay,\nSo there are some silly mistakes, okay,\nSo there are some silly mistakes, okay, that we just simply updated and now it\nthat we just simply updated and now it\nthat we just simply updated and now it is running absolutely fine. Simple.\nis running absolutely fine. Simple.\nis running absolutely fine. Simple. Okay, very very very good.\nOkay, very very very good.\nOkay, very very very good. So now\nSo now\nSo now let's talk about this amazing\nlet's talk about this amazing\nlet's talk about this amazing architecture.\narchitecture.\narchitecture. It's called orchestrator worker. And let\nIt's called orchestrator worker. And let\nIt's called orchestrator worker. And let me just tell you this is a kind of\nme just tell you this is a kind of\nme just tell you this is a kind of advanced architecture\nadvanced architecture\nadvanced architecture but nowadays not nowadays since the\nbut nowadays not nowadays since the\nbut nowadays not nowadays since the beginning if you want to work with any\nbeginning if you want to work with any\nbeginning if you want to work with any kind of agentic\nkind of agentic\nkind of agentic you can say framework then this is the\nyou can say framework then this is the\nyou can say framework then this is the one that every organization every single\none that every organization every single\none that every organization every single organization uses. Why? Because let me\norganization uses. Why? Because let me\norganization uses. Why? Because let me just first of all explain the\njust first of all explain the\njust first of all explain the architecture then you will automatically\narchitecture then you will automatically\narchitecture then you will automatically get the answer. Why?\nget the answer. Why?\nget the answer. Why? So let's say you are a user.\nSo let's say you are a user.\nSo let's say you are a user. Okay. Let's say\nOkay. Let's say\nOkay. Let's say you are this user. Simple. Okay.\nyou are this user. Simple. Okay.\nyou are this user. Simple. Okay. Now this user can submit\nNow this user can submit\nNow this user can submit multiple tasks in a single prompt.\nmultiple tasks in a single prompt.\nmultiple tasks in a single prompt. I want to get this. I want to do this.\nI want to get this. I want to do this.\nI want to get this. I want to do this. Can you please do this? Can you please\nCan you please do this? Can you please\nCan you please do this? Can you please do this? Enter.\ndo this? Enter.\ndo this? Enter. Obviously,\nObviously,\nObviously, right?\nright?\nright? You can\nYou can\nYou can submit multiple tasks in single prompt\nsubmit multiple tasks in single prompt\nsubmit multiple tasks in single prompt to the LLM. Simple. Very good. Now\nto the LLM. Simple. Very good. Now\nto the LLM. Simple. Very good. Now obviously\nobviously\nobviously LLM can perform these tasks in one go\nLLM can perform these tasks in one go\nLLM can perform these tasks in one go using the prompt because LLMs are like\nusing the prompt because LLMs are like\nusing the prompt because LLMs are like advanced enough nowadays. But\nadvanced enough nowadays. But\nadvanced enough nowadays. But what if in your query in your question\nwhat if in your query in your question\nwhat if in your query in your question you want to perform a specific tasks\nyou want to perform a specific tasks\nyou want to perform a specific tasks that LLM cannot do alone? Maybe LM might\nthat LLM cannot do alone? Maybe LM might\nthat LLM cannot do alone? Maybe LM might need to make some API calls, some tool\nneed to make some API calls, some tool\nneed to make some API calls, some tool calling or even forget about tool\ncalling or even forget about tool\ncalling or even forget about tool calling and API calls. We know that our\ncalling and API calls. We know that our\ncalling and API calls. We know that our LLM can handle tasks in parallel. But if\nLLM can handle tasks in parallel. But if\nLLM can handle tasks in parallel. But if you want to generate the accurate\nyou want to generate the accurate\nyou want to generate the accurate answers, the good answers, we need to\nanswers, the good answers, we need to\nanswers, the good answers, we need to just submit the tasks one by one.\njust submit the tasks one by one.\njust submit the tasks one by one. Make sense? Yes. Here when I said one by\nMake sense? Yes. Here when I said one by\nMake sense? Yes. Here when I said one by one that doesn't mean that I have to\none that doesn't mean that I have to\none that doesn't mean that I have to just submit one task then wait for the\njust submit one task then wait for the\njust submit one task then wait for the answer then second then third. No. I\nanswer then second then third. No. I\nanswer then second then third. No. I meant to say that we need to submit the\nmeant to say that we need to submit the\nmeant to say that we need to submit the independent task in chunks.\nindependent task in chunks.\nindependent task in chunks. Make sense? For example, I'm saying\nMake sense? For example, I'm saying\nMake sense? For example, I'm saying um what is 10 + 10 and what is the\num what is 10 + 10 and what is the\num what is 10 + 10 and what is the temperature in Dubai right now? So\ntemperature in Dubai right now? So\ntemperature in Dubai right now? So obviously these are two different tasks,\nobviously these are two different tasks,\nobviously these are two different tasks, right? I need to submit these two\nright? I need to submit these two\nright? I need to submit these two questions separately. In parallel, yes,\nquestions separately. In parallel, yes,\nquestions separately. In parallel, yes, in series, yes, that is a different\nin series, yes, that is a different\nin series, yes, that is a different thing. We can just submit those\nthing. We can just submit those\nthing. We can just submit those questions um maybe in a series or\nquestions um maybe in a series or\nquestions um maybe in a series or parallel. That's that's that that's not\nparallel. That's that's that that's not\nparallel. That's that's that that's not a problem. But the concern is I want to\na problem. But the concern is I want to\na problem. But the concern is I want to just make different requests, right? So,\njust make different requests, right? So,\njust make different requests, right? So, okay, here comes this this architecture.\nokay, here comes this this architecture.\nokay, here comes this this architecture. And this is a kind of architecture that\nAnd this is a kind of architecture that\nAnd this is a kind of architecture that we use in the real world. The above\nwe use in the real world. The above\nwe use in the real world. The above architectures that we have learned are\narchitectures that we have learned are\narchitectures that we have learned are just the micro components of the bigger\njust the micro components of the bigger\njust the micro components of the bigger architectures. We can use routing in our\narchitectures. We can use routing in our\narchitectures. We can use routing in our big architecture. We can use\nbig architecture. We can use\nbig architecture. We can use parallelization in our big architecture\nparallelization in our big architecture\nparallelization in our big architecture that is just like small small\nthat is just like small small\nthat is just like small small components. But orchestrator worker is a\ncomponents. But orchestrator worker is a\ncomponents. But orchestrator worker is a kind of complete architecture and\nkind of complete architecture and\nkind of complete architecture and obviously an advanced one. Um earlier I\nobviously an advanced one. Um earlier I\nobviously an advanced one. Um earlier I was thinking like should I just teach\nwas thinking like should I just teach\nwas thinking like should I just teach this as well because this is a kind of\nthis as well because this is a kind of\nthis as well because this is a kind of very advanced topic but I know it will\nvery advanced topic but I know it will\nvery advanced topic but I know it will require some extra efforts but it will\nrequire some extra efforts but it will\nrequire some extra efforts but it will be worth it and just hit the subscribe\nbe worth it and just hit the subscribe\nbe worth it and just hit the subscribe button right now. Okay, just hit the\nbutton right now. Okay, just hit the\nbutton right now. Okay, just hit the subscribe button if you find if you find\nsubscribe button if you find if you find\nsubscribe button if you find if you find this topic helpful. Make sense? Okay. So\nthis topic helpful. Make sense? Okay. So\nthis topic helpful. Make sense? Okay. So now let's talk about it. So what will\nnow let's talk about it. So what will\nnow let's talk about it. So what will happen? I will submit my query to the\nhappen? I will submit my query to the\nhappen? I will submit my query to the LLM. Let's say this is the LLM.\nLLM. Let's say this is the LLM.\nLLM. Let's say this is the LLM. That's the same thing that we are doing\nThat's the same thing that we are doing\nThat's the same thing that we are doing so far. Simple. Okay.\nso far. Simple. Okay.\nso far. Simple. Okay. So this is done. This is not a big deal.\nSo this is done. This is not a big deal.\nSo this is done. This is not a big deal. We know that we can just do this simple.\nWe know that we can just do this simple.\nWe know that we can just do this simple. But now I do not want to directly submit\nBut now I do not want to directly submit\nBut now I do not want to directly submit my query which has like so many\nmy query which has like so many\nmy query which has like so many questions within. Right now you can say\nquestions within. Right now you can say\nquestions within. Right now you can say uh\nso many questions\nso many questions in a\nin a\nin a query. Right? So what I will do\nquery. Right? So what I will do\nquery. Right? So what I will do now the real work will be started. Okay,\nnow the real work will be started. Okay,\nnow the real work will be started. Okay, what kind of real work? Let me just show\nwhat kind of real work? Let me just show\nwhat kind of real work? Let me just show you. So, first of all, I will send this\nyou. So, first of all, I will send this\nyou. So, first of all, I will send this query to the LLM. And do you know what\nquery to the LLM. And do you know what\nquery to the LLM. And do you know what this node, this LLM node will be called\nthis node, this LLM node will be called\nthis node, this LLM node will be called as orchestrator.\nAnd do you know what this node will do?\nAnd do you know what this node will do? This node will not execute anything.\nThis node will not execute anything.\nThis node will not execute anything. Okay, this node will create the list of\nOkay, this node will create the list of\nOkay, this node will create the list of tasks.\nThis node will create the list of tasks.\nThis node will create the list of tasks. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Simple.\nOkay. This will create the list of\nOkay. This will create the list of tasks. That's it. Because this is an\ntasks. That's it. Because this is an\ntasks. That's it. Because this is an orchestrator.\norchestrator.\norchestrator. This cannot perform anything. This will\nThis cannot perform anything. This will\nThis cannot perform anything. This will simply orchestrate. This will like this\nsimply orchestrate. This will like this\nsimply orchestrate. This will like this is responsible for the orchestration.\nis responsible for the orchestration.\nis responsible for the orchestration. Simple. So this will take your query and\nSimple. So this will take your query and\nSimple. So this will take your query and it will generate the list out of it.\nit will generate the list out of it.\nit will generate the list out of it. Wow, how obviously we'll just see how.\nWow, how obviously we'll just see how.\nWow, how obviously we'll just see how. So this will create the list of tasks.\nSo this will create the list of tasks.\nSo this will create the list of tasks. Make sense? Then comes the worker node.\nMake sense? Then comes the worker node.\nMake sense? Then comes the worker node. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. Then comes the worker node. So let's say\nThen comes the worker node. So let's say\nThen comes the worker node. So let's say this one.\nthis one.\nthis one. So this worker node is very special.\nSo this worker node is very special.\nSo this worker node is very special. This worker node will perform obviously\nThis worker node will perform obviously\nThis worker node will perform obviously all the tasks. Common sense because we\nall the tasks. Common sense because we\nall the tasks. Common sense because we need to perform the tasks. So like we\nneed to perform the tasks. So like we\nneed to perform the tasks. So like we need to execute the tasks. But now do\nneed to execute the tasks. But now do\nneed to execute the tasks. But now do you know what this worker node this one\nyou know what this worker node this one\nyou know what this worker node this one will\nwill\nwill will not perform tasks in one go or\nwill not perform tasks in one go or\nwill not perform tasks in one go or let's say perform task one by one by\nlet's say perform task one by one by\nlet's say perform task one by one by one. No this worker node is special.\none. No this worker node is special.\none. No this worker node is special. This has multiple threads. Okay. This\nThis has multiple threads. Okay. This\nThis has multiple threads. Okay. This has multiple threads. So let's say\nhas multiple threads. So let's say\nhas multiple threads. So let's say thread one, thread two, thread three.\nthread one, thread two, thread three.\nthread one, thread two, thread three. And these threads are dynamic. These are\nAnd these threads are dynamic. These are\nAnd these threads are dynamic. These are purely based upon the number of tasks\npurely based upon the number of tasks\npurely based upon the number of tasks that we have in the list. Let's say in\nthat we have in the list. Let's say in\nthat we have in the list. Let's say in our list we have three tasks. So it will\nour list we have three tasks. So it will\nour list we have three tasks. So it will create three threads. If it it if it has\ncreate three threads. If it it if it has\ncreate three threads. If it it if it has let's say 10 task, it will create 10\nlet's say 10 task, it will create 10\nlet's say 10 task, it will create 10 threads. If it has let's say 20 task, it\nthreads. If it has let's say 20 task, it\nthreads. If it has let's say 20 task, it will create 20 threads and it will\nwill create 20 threads and it will\nwill create 20 threads and it will perform\nperform\nperform the execution\nthe execution\nthe execution automatically parallelly to save the\nautomatically parallelly to save the\nautomatically parallelly to save the task like to save the time. So this node\ntask like to save the time. So this node\ntask like to save the time. So this node is called my worker node. This entire\nis called my worker node. This entire\nis called my worker node. This entire node\nnode\nnode simple this node is called worker node\nwhich is having threads right okay now\nwhich is having threads right okay now you will say anal lamba yeah this node\nyou will say anal lamba yeah this node\nyou will say anal lamba yeah this node can perform these tasks right yeah so\ncan perform these tasks right yeah so\ncan perform these tasks right yeah so how to perform this task like what will\nhow to perform this task like what will\nhow to perform this task like what will be the execution thing that we need to\nbe the execution thing that we need to\nbe the execution thing that we need to execute because we need to execute\nexecute because we need to execute\nexecute because we need to execute something right exactly so when this\nsomething right exactly so when this\nsomething right exactly so when this will create multiple threads It will\nwill create multiple threads It will\nwill create multiple threads It will create threads on top of a specific\ncreate threads on top of a specific\ncreate threads on top of a specific function. So this will be having a kind\nfunction. So this will be having a kind\nfunction. So this will be having a kind of function\nsimple. Let me just write let's say\nsimple. Let me just write let's say function. So this will run the threads\nfunction. So this will run the threads\nfunction. So this will run the threads for function\nfor function\nfor function in parallel.\nin parallel.\nin parallel. Wow.\nWow.\nWow. Make sense?\nMake sense?\nMake sense? And then once everything is completed.\nAnd then once everything is completed.\nAnd then once everything is completed. Okay. Once everything is completed then\nOkay. Once everything is completed then\nOkay. Once everything is completed then we can have a kind of collector task as\nwe can have a kind of collector task as\nwe can have a kind of collector task as well or you can say collector node as\nwell or you can say collector node as\nwell or you can say collector node as well. So this will simply collect all of\nwell. So this will simply collect all of\nwell. So this will simply collect all of the results of task and it can just\nthe results of task and it can just\nthe results of task and it can just generate the output to you. Okay, it's\ngenerate the output to you. Okay, it's\ngenerate the output to you. Okay, it's like optional thing but it's good to\nlike optional thing but it's good to\nlike optional thing but it's good to have thing. So let's say this is a\nhave thing. So let's say this is a\nhave thing. So let's say this is a collector.\nOkay. So this is called collector. That\nOkay. So this is called collector. That means it will collect everything.\nmeans it will collect everything.\nmeans it will collect everything. Simple.\nthis will collect the results of task.\nthis will collect the results of task. Perfect. Simple. And then finally\nPerfect. Simple. And then finally\nPerfect. Simple. And then finally you will get the response back\nyou will get the response back\nyou will get the response back by this collector. Simple.\nby this collector. Simple.\nby this collector. Simple. This is the entire architecture and this\nThis is the entire architecture and this\nThis is the entire architecture and this is a complex one. Okay. You have to be\nis a complex one. Okay. You have to be\nis a complex one. Okay. You have to be very careful while building this. So\nvery careful while building this. So\nvery careful while building this. So this is the architecture that we build\nthis is the architecture that we build\nthis is the architecture that we build in real life. I hope it makes sense.\nin real life. I hope it makes sense.\nin real life. I hope it makes sense. Okay. So this is the architecture. Now\nOkay. So this is the architecture. Now\nOkay. So this is the architecture. Now we are just trying to build.\nwe are just trying to build.\nwe are just trying to build. Make sense? Let me just open my VS code.\nMake sense? Let me just open my VS code.\nMake sense? Let me just open my VS code. Let's try to do this. Yep, perfect. So\nLet's try to do this. Yep, perfect. So\nLet's try to do this. Yep, perfect. So now first thing first, let me just\nnow first thing first, let me just\nnow first thing first, let me just create a new notebook\ncreate a new notebook\ncreate a new notebook and let me just say\norchestrator\norchestrator worker ipyv. And yes, you might be\nworker ipyv. And yes, you might be\nworker ipyv. And yes, you might be watching this segment of the video\nwatching this segment of the video\nwatching this segment of the video multiple times because this is actually\nmultiple times because this is actually\nmultiple times because this is actually important and this is a little bit\nimportant and this is a little bit\nimportant and this is a little bit critical, okay, and obviously complex\ncritical, okay, and obviously complex\ncritical, okay, and obviously complex one as well. So\none as well. So\none as well. So first of all what you need to do just\nfirst of all what you need to do just\nfirst of all what you need to do just import the boiler plate code simple. So\nimport the boiler plate code simple. So\nimport the boiler plate code simple. So let me just import the boiler plate code\nlet me just import the boiler plate code\nlet me just import the boiler plate code from here.\nSimple code and select kernel. This is\nSimple code and select kernel. This is the kernel. Run this.\nthe kernel. Run this.\nthe kernel. Run this. Perfect. Let's create the llm object.\nPerfect. Let's create the llm object.\nPerfect. Let's create the llm object. Uh let me just get the code from here.\nSo okay perfect my LM object is also\nSo okay perfect my LM object is also created. Now you need to create a\ncreated. Now you need to create a\ncreated. Now you need to create a special node which will create the list\nspecial node which will create the list\nspecial node which will create the list of tasks right. So you have already\nof tasks right. So you have already\nof tasks right. So you have already worked with a scenario where your LLM\nworked with a scenario where your LLM\nworked with a scenario where your LLM just generates a kind of schema.\njust generates a kind of schema.\njust generates a kind of schema. If you remember in the routing part we\nIf you remember in the routing part we\nIf you remember in the routing part we learned that we can create a special LLM\nlearned that we can create a special LLM\nlearned that we can create a special LLM object which will generate the specific\nobject which will generate the specific\nobject which will generate the specific you can say output\nyou can say output\nyou can say output right. So here do you know what we we we\nright. So here do you know what we we we\nright. So here do you know what we we we will be just doing here. So here I will\nwill be just doing here. So here I will\nwill be just doing here. So here I will be creating a kind of pentic schema\nbe creating a kind of pentic schema\nbe creating a kind of pentic schema which will generate the list of tasks\nwhich will generate the list of tasks\nwhich will generate the list of tasks simple because I want to use that thing\nsimple because I want to use that thing\nsimple because I want to use that thing like what are the list make sense? Okay.\nlike what are the list make sense? Okay.\nlike what are the list make sense? Okay. So what I will do I will simply say\nPentec\nPentec LLM schema simple so here I need to\nLLM schema simple so here I need to\nLLM schema simple so here I need to generate the schema for the\ngenerate the schema for the\ngenerate the schema for the you can say LLM because see when we will\nyou can say LLM because see when we will\nyou can say LLM because see when we will be just creating our main schema for the\nbe just creating our main schema for the\nbe just creating our main schema for the graph obviously We need to have tasks.\ngraph obviously We need to have tasks.\ngraph obviously We need to have tasks. That is the common sense.\nThat is the common sense.\nThat is the common sense. Who will generate that task key? This\nWho will generate that task key? This\nWho will generate that task key? This pentic LM\npentic LM\npentic LM makes sense because we need one LLM\nmakes sense because we need one LLM\nmakes sense because we need one LLM which will only generate the output in\nwhich will only generate the output in\nwhich will only generate the output in the form of specific schema because we\nthe form of specific schema because we\nthe form of specific schema because we need a list right very good. So let's\nneed a list right very good. So let's\nneed a list right very good. So let's create the um object. So I'll say class\ncreate the um object. So I'll say class\ncreate the um object. So I'll say class um LLM output is or let's say LLM schema\num LLM output is or let's say LLM schema\num LLM output is or let's say LLM schema base model and here it will be let's say\nbase model and here it will be let's say\nbase model and here it will be let's say tasks and this will be list\ntasks and this will be list\ntasks and this will be list and let me just import\nand let me just import\nand let me just import from pyic import base model from typing\nfrom pyic import base model from typing\nfrom pyic import base model from typing board list and I also want to import\nboard list and I also want to import\nboard list and I also want to import field because I want to provide some\nfield because I want to provide some\nfield because I want to provide some description\ndescription\ndescription because LLM can better understand the\nbecause LLM can better understand the\nbecause LLM can better understand the things then field description A list of\nthings then field description A list of\nthings then field description A list of task perform. Wow, very good\ntask perform. Wow, very good\ntask perform. Wow, very good description. So now it is created. Now I\ndescription. So now it is created. Now I\ndescription. So now it is created. Now I can simply create LLM with schema\ncan simply create LLM with schema\ncan simply create LLM with schema equals LLM dot with structured output.\nequals LLM dot with structured output.\nequals LLM dot with structured output. And this is the LLM schema. Perfect. Now\nAnd this is the LLM schema. Perfect. Now\nAnd this is the LLM schema. Perfect. Now let's try to test it. I will simply say\nlet's try to test it. I will simply say\nlet's try to test it. I will simply say llm schema\nllm schema\nllm schema or llm with schema dot invoke\nor llm with schema dot invoke\nor llm with schema dot invoke um and I say uh what is not what is\num and I say uh what is not what is\num and I say uh what is not what is let's say yeah what is the capital of\nlet's say yeah what is the capital of\nlet's say yeah what is the capital of France and\nwhat is the population of France that's\nwhat is the population of France that's a two different question right let's see\na two different question right let's see\na two different question right let's see what do we get we should see a list with\nwhat do we get we should see a list with\nwhat do we get we should see a list with two tasks right let's\nYes. What do we get? No, it has just\nYes. What do we get? No, it has just created the one. So, I can just be more\ncreated the one. So, I can just be more\ncreated the one. So, I can just be more specific or we do not need to be more\nspecific or we do not need to be more\nspecific or we do not need to be more specific here because this is just a\nspecific here because this is just a\nspecific here because this is just a data type. We will be more specific when\ndata type. We will be more specific when\ndata type. We will be more specific when we will be calling this LLM with a kind\nwe will be calling this LLM with a kind\nwe will be calling this LLM with a kind of you can say template, right? Because\nof you can say template, right? Because\nof you can say template, right? Because we do not need to call it this thing. We\nwe do not need to call it this thing. We\nwe do not need to call it this thing. We just need to test it here that it is\njust need to test it here that it is\njust need to test it here that it is returning a task list and that's it. the\nreturning a task list and that's it. the\nreturning a task list and that's it. the task items within the list. We will be\ntask items within the list. We will be\ntask items within the list. We will be just manipulating it during the\njust manipulating it during the\njust manipulating it during the invocation in our graph, right? So that\ninvocation in our graph, right? So that\ninvocation in our graph, right? So that is fine. We do not need to be very\nis fine. We do not need to be very\nis fine. We do not need to be very specific here because this is just a\nspecific here because this is just a\nspecific here because this is just a description for the list that it is\ndescription for the list that it is\ndescription for the list that it is returning the list. Simple. Okay. So\nreturning the list. Simple. Okay. So\nreturning the list. Simple. Okay. So this is fine. So our pyantic LLM schema\nthis is fine. So our pyantic LLM schema\nthis is fine. So our pyantic LLM schema is created. Simple. And our LLM object\nis created. Simple. And our LLM object\nis created. Simple. And our LLM object is also created. Now let's define the\nis also created. Now let's define the\nis also created. Now let's define the schema for our code. So I will say\nschema for our code. So I will say\nschema for our code. So I will say graph\ngraph\ngraph schema\nschema\nschema simple and here I want to create let's\nsimple and here I want to create let's\nsimple and here I want to create let's say\ngraph schema and type debt perfect. So\ngraph schema and type debt perfect. So here what do I need?\nhere what do I need?\nhere what do I need? I need first of all tasks.\nFirst of all, tasks obviously. So tasks\nFirst of all, tasks obviously. So tasks will be of list string. Then what do I\nwill be of list string. Then what do I\nwill be of list string. Then what do I need? I need let's say\nneed? I need let's say\nneed? I need let's say because that's the only thing that we\nbecause that's the only thing that we\nbecause that's the only thing that we need and obviously query by the user.\nneed and obviously query by the user.\nneed and obviously query by the user. Okay, query is string. So these two are\nOkay, query is string. So these two are\nOkay, query is string. So these two are the mandatory task that we have. Then we\nthe mandatory task that we have. Then we\nthe mandatory task that we have. Then we will also create uh one more you can say\nwill also create uh one more you can say\nwill also create uh one more you can say key that is called results. And this\nkey that is called results. And this\nkey that is called results. And this will be also a list. Why list? because\nwill be also a list. Why list? because\nwill be also a list. Why list? because we'll be having multiple tasks, right?\nwe'll be having multiple tasks, right?\nwe'll be having multiple tasks, right? So, let's create a list of it. Simple.\nSo, let's create a list of it. Simple.\nSo, let's create a list of it. Simple. And just as you can say a kind of um\nAnd just as you can say a kind of um\nAnd just as you can say a kind of um optional key, we can also say summary.\noptional key, we can also say summary.\noptional key, we can also say summary. Let's say we want to provide the summary\nLet's say we want to provide the summary\nLet's say we want to provide the summary as well to the user that hey, these are\nas well to the user that hey, these are\nas well to the user that hey, these are all of the um answers that we have\nall of the um answers that we have\nall of the um answers that we have provided as per your questions and it\nprovided as per your questions and it\nprovided as per your questions and it will look good and it will be like more\nwill look good and it will be like more\nwill look good and it will be like more professional. So, this is the graph\nprofessional. So, this is the graph\nprofessional. So, this is the graph schema right class graph schema and this\nschema right class graph schema and this\nschema right class graph schema and this is the schema. So I have created this\nis the schema. So I have created this\nis the schema. So I have created this thing type detect is not defined. Let me\nthing type detect is not defined. Let me\nthing type detect is not defined. Let me just run this.\njust run this.\njust run this. Perfect. So my graph schema is ready.\nPerfect. So my graph schema is ready.\nPerfect. So my graph schema is ready. Very good. Now I need to create the\nVery good. Now I need to create the\nVery good. Now I need to create the worker node. Oh sorry orchestrator node.\nworker node. Oh sorry orchestrator node.\nworker node. Oh sorry orchestrator node. If I just want to see my chart\nIf I just want to see my chart\nIf I just want to see my chart orchestrator node will create the list\norchestrator node will create the list\norchestrator node will create the list of task. Right. Let's try to create\nof task. Right. Let's try to create\nof task. Right. Let's try to create this. So I will say\ncreating let's say worker node\ncreating let's say worker node not worker orchestrator\nsimple okay so now what I will do I will\nsimple okay so now what I will do I will create a function tf and you can say\ncreate a function tf and you can say\ncreate a function tf and you can say orchestrate a node um it will take state\norchestrate a node um it will take state\norchestrate a node um it will take state obviously of graph schema and we will\nobviously of graph schema and we will\nobviously of graph schema and we will generate the graph schema. Okay. Yeah.\ngenerate the graph schema. Okay. Yeah.\ngenerate the graph schema. Okay. Yeah. So first of all I will get the input\nSo first of all I will get the input\nSo first of all I will get the input right. First of all the input that I\nright. First of all the input that I\nright. First of all the input that I want to perform. So I will say query or\nwant to perform. So I will say query or\nwant to perform. So I will say query or user query\nuser query\nuser query equals to state of query. Perfect.\nequals to state of query. Perfect.\nequals to state of query. Perfect. Fetching the\nFetching the\nFetching the user query. Simple. That is the first\nuser query. Simple. That is the first\nuser query. Simple. That is the first thing. Fetching the\nthing. Fetching the\nthing. Fetching the user query. Perfect. Now what I need to\nuser query. Perfect. Now what I need to\nuser query. Perfect. Now what I need to do, I will generate\ndo, I will generate\ndo, I will generate a prompt because I want to be very very\na prompt because I want to be very very\na prompt because I want to be very very specific because I want my LLM to\nspecific because I want my LLM to\nspecific because I want my LLM to generate the accurate answer. And\ngenerate the accurate answer. And\ngenerate the accurate answer. And obviously whenever you want to generate\nobviously whenever you want to generate\nobviously whenever you want to generate accurate answers, we should always use\naccurate answers, we should always use\naccurate answers, we should always use prompt because prompts can guide LM\nprompt because prompts can guide LM\nprompt because prompts can guide LM better. So here I will create the\nbetter. So here I will create the\nbetter. So here I will create the prompt.\nprompt.\nprompt. Create the prompt for LM.\nSo I will say prompt equals chat prompt\nSo I will say prompt equals chat prompt template\ntemplate\ntemplate dot from messages and we do not have\ndot from messages and we do not have\ndot from messages and we do not have chat prompt template. Let me just in um\nchat prompt template. Let me just in um\nchat prompt template. Let me just in um call it\ncall it\ncall it from perfect\nfrom perfect\nfrom perfect and dot from messages. Let me just\nand dot from messages. Let me just\nand dot from messages. Let me just create the list.\ncreate the list.\ncreate the list. Perfect. So here let's see what it has\nPerfect. So here let's see what it has\nPerfect. So here let's see what it has written. You are an orchestrator that\nwritten. You are an orchestrator that\nwritten. You are an orchestrator that breaks down user query into tasks for\nbreaks down user query into tasks for\nbreaks down user query into tasks for the worker. Very good. Very good. That\nthe worker. Very good. Very good. That\nthe worker. Very good. Very good. That is a very good system message. And let\nis a very good system message. And let\nis a very good system message. And let me just modify the user message. So user\nme just modify the user message. So user\nme just modify the user message. So user query is this. Perfect. Please break\nquery is this. Perfect. Please break\nquery is this. Perfect. Please break down this task into list into a list of\ndown this task into list into a list of\ndown this task into list into a list of task for the worker to perform. Um no, I\ntask for the worker to perform. Um no, I\ntask for the worker to perform. Um no, I will be very specific. I will say\nwill be very specific. I will say\nwill be very specific. I will say please generate one\nplease generate one\nplease generate one prompt\nprompt\nprompt per task\nper task\nper task for the worker to complete. Very good.\nfor the worker to complete. Very good.\nfor the worker to complete. Very good. Let's try to use this prompt. Okay. And\nLet's try to use this prompt. Okay. And\nLet's try to use this prompt. Okay. And let's see how does it behave. So, okay.\nlet's see how does it behave. So, okay.\nlet's see how does it behave. So, okay. This is the thing user query. Okay. And\nThis is the thing user query. Okay. And\nThis is the thing user query. Okay. And user query is here. So, this is my\nuser query is here. So, this is my\nuser query is here. So, this is my prompt. Simple.\nprompt. Simple.\nprompt. Simple. Now, when I will be calling the LLM, I\nNow, when I will be calling the LLM, I\nNow, when I will be calling the LLM, I will simply pass this prompt. Simple. I\nwill simply pass this prompt. Simple. I\nwill simply pass this prompt. Simple. I can simply say\ncan simply say\ncan simply say now I have two options. I can also\nnow I have two options. I can also\nnow I have two options. I can also invoke my prompt right now. So, because\ninvoke my prompt right now. So, because\ninvoke my prompt right now. So, because I obviously need to fulfill this thing\nI obviously need to fulfill this thing\nI obviously need to fulfill this thing which is user query. Okay. And then I\nwhich is user query. Okay. And then I\nwhich is user query. Okay. And then I can simply call the LLM or I can create\ncan simply call the LLM or I can create\ncan simply call the LLM or I can create a quick you can say chain. Okay, quick\na quick you can say chain. Okay, quick\na quick you can say chain. Okay, quick chain. So let's create a quick chain\nchain. So let's create a quick chain\nchain. So let's create a quick chain because now we know the fundamentals of\nbecause now we know the fundamentals of\nbecause now we know the fundamentals of lang chain. Uh quick chain or let's say\nlang chain. Uh quick chain or let's say\nlang chain. Uh quick chain or let's say create the chain.\ncreate the chain.\ncreate the chain. So chain will be\nSo chain will be\nSo chain will be um first of all prompt\num first of all prompt\num first of all prompt and then llm with schema. Why did I\nand then llm with schema. Why did I\nand then llm with schema. Why did I create chain? Because I don't want to\ncreate chain? Because I don't want to\ncreate chain? Because I don't want to use dot invoke dot invoke two times.\nuse dot invoke dot invoke two times.\nuse dot invoke dot invoke two times. This chain will just do the work. Okay.\nThis chain will just do the work. Okay.\nThis chain will just do the work. Okay. So this is my chain. Now I can simply\nSo this is my chain. Now I can simply\nSo this is my chain. Now I can simply invoke the chain and that's it. So I'll\ninvoke the chain and that's it. So I'll\ninvoke the chain and that's it. So I'll simply say chain.run. No, I don't like\nsimply say chain.run. No, I don't like\nsimply say chain.run. No, I don't like run method. I like invoke.\nrun method. I like invoke.\nrun method. I like invoke. Okay. Query equals to user query.\nOkay. Query equals to user query.\nOkay. Query equals to user query. Perfect. So now this response should\nPerfect. So now this response should\nPerfect. So now this response should have the task list. Yes, the task list.\nhave the task list. Yes, the task list.\nhave the task list. Yes, the task list. Update the task list. Perfect. And we\nUpdate the task list. Perfect. And we\nUpdate the task list. Perfect. And we have got the response. And it has\nhave got the response. And it has\nhave got the response. And it has performed response. Tasks.\nperformed response. Tasks.\nperformed response. Tasks. um response dot tasks. Yes, because this\num response dot tasks. Yes, because this\num response dot tasks. Yes, because this will be a kind of dictionary. I think it\nwill be a kind of dictionary. I think it\nwill be a kind of dictionary. I think it should be response of tasks. Uh let me\nshould be response of tasks. Uh let me\nshould be response of tasks. Uh let me first of all check because obviously we\nfirst of all check because obviously we\nfirst of all check because obviously we need to test it because we haven't\nneed to test it because we haven't\nneed to test it because we haven't tested it. So let's try to test it first\ntested it. So let's try to test it first\ntested it. So let's try to test it first of all because I don't know if it will\nof all because I don't know if it will\nof all because I don't know if it will work or not. Like obviously I know it\nwork or not. Like obviously I know it\nwork or not. Like obviously I know it will work but\nthis prompt needs to be tested. Okay. So\nthis prompt needs to be tested. Okay. So now here I need to pass a user query.\nnow here I need to pass a user query.\nnow here I need to pass a user query. Now I will simply say user query\nNow I will simply say user query\nNow I will simply say user query trip for Paris.\ntrip for Paris.\ntrip for Paris. So let me just provide any random thing.\nSo let me just provide any random thing.\nSo let me just provide any random thing. What is the capital of France and what\nWhat is the capital of France and what\nWhat is the capital of France and what is the population of Paris? Let's say\nis the population of Paris? Let's say\nis the population of Paris? Let's say yeah. So we need to make sure that this\nyeah. So we need to make sure that this\nyeah. So we need to make sure that this response\nresponse\nresponse will generate the list. Right? Let's see\nwill generate the list. Right? Let's see\nwill generate the list. Right? Let's see what do we get when we run this. Let's\nwhat do we get when we run this. Let's\nwhat do we get when we run this. Let's see. This is a testing phase. Perfect.\nsee. This is a testing phase. Perfect.\nsee. This is a testing phase. Perfect. Very good. This time you can see the\nVery good. This time you can see the\nVery good. This time you can see the tasks list is actually a kind of list of\ntasks list is actually a kind of list of\ntasks list is actually a kind of list of two items, different items, right? Wow.\ntwo items, different items, right? Wow.\ntwo items, different items, right? Wow. And this is the first one. Okay. And\nAnd this is the first one. Okay. And\nAnd this is the first one. Okay. And this is the second one. Very good. Very\nthis is the second one. Very good. Very\nthis is the second one. Very good. Very good. And if I just say response task\ngood. And if I just say response task\ngood. And if I just say response task because this is a pyantic object\nbecause this is a pyantic object\nbecause this is a pyantic object obviously because llm with schema is a\nobviously because llm with schema is a\nobviously because llm with schema is a llm which is bind with structured\nllm which is bind with structured\nllm which is bind with structured output. Perfect. That's exactly I need.\noutput. Perfect. That's exactly I need.\noutput. Perfect. That's exactly I need. Very good. This is tested and this is\nVery good. This is tested and this is\nVery good. This is tested and this is working absolutely fine. Perfect. So\nworking absolutely fine. Perfect. So\nworking absolutely fine. Perfect. So this is good. My orchestrator node is\nthis is good. My orchestrator node is\nthis is good. My orchestrator node is done. Now let's create the worker node.\ndone. Now let's create the worker node.\ndone. Now let's create the worker node. Okay. And worker node is very very\nOkay. And worker node is very very\nOkay. And worker node is very very important. Obviously orchestrator\nimportant. Obviously orchestrator\nimportant. Obviously orchestrator orchestrator node is also important.\nWorker node. Now just tell me one thing.\nWorker node. Now just tell me one thing. If I just go back to my architecture I\nIf I just go back to my architecture I\nIf I just go back to my architecture I need first of all two things.\nneed first of all two things.\nneed first of all two things. First of all the worker node which will\nFirst of all the worker node which will\nFirst of all the worker node which will generate the parallel threads and the\ngenerate the parallel threads and the\ngenerate the parallel threads and the function as well obviously because I\nfunction as well obviously because I\nfunction as well obviously because I need to generate the threads for the\nneed to generate the threads for the\nneed to generate the threads for the function right so first of all let's\nfunction right so first of all let's\nfunction right so first of all let's create this quick function which is\ncreate this quick function which is\ncreate this quick function which is nothing but just the llm call and that's\nnothing but just the llm call and that's\nnothing but just the llm call and that's it okay so I will go here and I will\nit okay so I will go here and I will\nit okay so I will go here and I will create the\ncreate the\ncreate the um you can say\num you can say\num you can say this will be let's say\nthis will be let's say\nthis will be let's say execute function that you want to\nexecute function that you want to\nexecute function that you want to execute simple so I will say EF\nexecute simple so I will say EF\nexecute simple so I will say EF execute.\nexecute.\nexecute. Okay. And I will take state um not state\nOkay. And I will take state um not state\nOkay. And I will take state um not state basically I can take query\nbasically I can take query\nbasically I can take query and then string simple. And this will\nand then string simple. And this will\nand then string simple. And this will yeah that is fine.\nyeah that is fine.\nyeah that is fine. So now what it will do it will simply\nSo now what it will do it will simply\nSo now what it will do it will simply execute the task and that's it. It will\nexecute the task and that's it. It will\nexecute the task and that's it. It will simply send the uh call or basically\nsimply send the uh call or basically\nsimply send the uh call or basically make the call to the API LLM API and\nmake the call to the API LLM API and\nmake the call to the API LLM API and that's it. That's it and that's exactly\nthat's it. That's it and that's exactly\nthat's it. That's it and that's exactly we need to do right. So I'll simply say\nwe need to do right. So I'll simply say\nwe need to do right. So I'll simply say llm or let's say response\nllm or let's say response\nllm or let's say response equals llm.invoke\nequals llm.invoke\nequals llm.invoke simple lm not llm with schema because\nsimple lm not llm with schema because\nsimple lm not llm with schema because this is like real execution not the\nthis is like real execution not the\nthis is like real execution not the generating the task. So I will simply\ngenerating the task. So I will simply\ngenerating the task. So I will simply say\nsay\nsay um please\nwhat not please simply send the query\nwhat not please simply send the query what is please\nwhat is please\nwhat is please lm and generate the thing okay so\nlm and generate the thing okay so\nlm and generate the thing okay so llm.invoke invoke and query equals to\nllm.invoke invoke and query equals to\nllm.invoke invoke and query equals to query. Um no we do not need to say query\nquery. Um no we do not need to say query\nquery. Um no we do not need to say query because we can directly say dot invoke\nbecause we can directly say dot invoke\nbecause we can directly say dot invoke simple because see\nsimple because see\nsimple because see this list will be having our tasks right\nthis list will be having our tasks right\nthis list will be having our tasks right or we can just let's say be a little bit\nor we can just let's say be a little bit\nor we can just let's say be a little bit polite we can say please\npolite we can say please\npolite we can say please execute this task\nexecute this task\nexecute this task simple\nsimple\nsimple okay we can say this thing please\nokay we can say this thing please\nokay we can say this thing please execute this task and we can just return\nexecute this task and we can just return\nexecute this task and we can just return the response\nPerfect. This is my simple function\nPerfect. This is my simple function execute function. Now we'll be creating\nexecute function. Now we'll be creating\nexecute function. Now we'll be creating the\nthe\nthe main exeutor node or basically you can\nmain exeutor node or basically you can\nmain exeutor node or basically you can say worker node which is generating the\nsay worker node which is generating the\nsay worker node which is generating the parallel threads. And for that you need\nparallel threads. And for that you need\nparallel threads. And for that you need to have a very good understanding of\nto have a very good understanding of\nto have a very good understanding of thread pool exeutor that we use in\nthread pool exeutor that we use in\nthread pool exeutor that we use in Python. Again Python fundamentals\nPython. Again Python fundamentals\nPython. Again Python fundamentals make your Python skills strong if you\nmake your Python skills strong if you\nmake your Python skills strong if you want to grow in today's era. Everyone\nwant to grow in today's era. Everyone\nwant to grow in today's era. Everyone wants to learn lang chain, langraph,\nwants to learn lang chain, langraph,\nwants to learn lang chain, langraph, blah blah blah. Learn Python first.\nblah blah blah. Learn Python first.\nblah blah blah. Learn Python first. Learn Python first. It's all about\nLearn Python first. It's all about\nLearn Python first. It's all about Python. Okay, at the end of the day,\nPython. Okay, at the end of the day,\nPython. Okay, at the end of the day, it's all about Python. So now I'll be\nit's all about Python. So now I'll be\nit's all about Python. So now I'll be just using threadpool exeutor. If you do\njust using threadpool exeutor. If you do\njust using threadpool exeutor. If you do not know about multi-threading and\nnot know about multi-threading and\nnot know about multi-threading and threadpool exeutor, you can just go and\nthreadpool exeutor, you can just go and\nthreadpool exeutor, you can just go and just learn about it. It's a very good\njust learn about it. It's a very good\njust learn about it. It's a very good feature in Python or not in Python. It's\nfeature in Python or not in Python. It's\nfeature in Python or not in Python. It's available in every programming language.\navailable in every programming language.\navailable in every programming language. Like how we can just generate parallel\nLike how we can just generate parallel\nLike how we can just generate parallel threads and we can execute our code in\nthreads and we can execute our code in\nthreads and we can execute our code in parallel. It is different from\nparallel. It is different from\nparallel. It is different from asynchronous behavior. Do not get\nasynchronous behavior. Do not get\nasynchronous behavior. Do not get confused. This is totally different\nconfused. This is totally different\nconfused. This is totally different thing. We are data engineers. We know\nthing. We are data engineers. We know\nthing. We are data engineers. We know it. So it's not about data engineers\nit. So it's not about data engineers\nit. So it's not about data engineers bro. Like if you are programmer, you\nbro. Like if you are programmer, you\nbro. Like if you are programmer, you should know about this thing which is\nshould know about this thing which is\nshould know about this thing which is called parallel threads. Okay. So for\ncalled parallel threads. Okay. So for\ncalled parallel threads. Okay. So for that particular thing, I would need to\nthat particular thing, I would need to\nthat particular thing, I would need to you can say import one library which is\nyou can say import one library which is\nyou can say import one library which is called threadpool exeutor from\ncalled threadpool exeutor from\ncalled threadpool exeutor from concurrent.futures.\nconcurrent.futures.\nconcurrent.futures. Simple. So let me just do that. From\nSimple. So let me just do that. From\nSimple. So let me just do that. From concurrent.futures import threadpool\nconcurrent.futures import threadpool\nconcurrent.futures import threadpool exeutor. Simple. So now this thread pool\nexeutor. Simple. So now this thread pool\nexeutor. Simple. So now this thread pool executor will do the real work. So I\nexecutor will do the real work. So I\nexecutor will do the real work. So I will say df worker node and I will take\nwill say df worker node and I will take\nwill say df worker node and I will take the state\nthe state\nthe state of graph schema. Perfect. And here's the\nof graph schema. Perfect. And here's the\nof graph schema. Perfect. And here's the thing. First of all I will f the tasks\nthing. First of all I will f the tasks\nthing. First of all I will f the tasks that I want to perform. Perfect. And I\nthat I want to perform. Perfect. And I\nthat I want to perform. Perfect. And I will create a empty list of results.\nwill create a empty list of results.\nwill create a empty list of results. Very good. Then this is the thread pool\nVery good. Then this is the thread pool\nVery good. Then this is the thread pool executor. I will open my context\nexecutor. I will open my context\nexecutor. I will open my context manager. I will say with thread pool\nmanager. I will say with thread pool\nmanager. I will say with thread pool executor.\nexecutor.\nexecutor. Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay. As executor.\nAs executor.\nAs executor. So this is fine. This is fine. Like this\nSo this is fine. This is fine. Like this\nSo this is fine. This is fine. Like this part is fine. But you know what? When we\npart is fine. But you know what? When we\npart is fine. But you know what? When we define this thing, we do not know like\ndefine this thing, we do not know like\ndefine this thing, we do not know like how many executors we need or basically\nhow many executors we need or basically\nhow many executors we need or basically how many workers we need, right? And\nhow many workers we need, right? And\nhow many workers we need, right? And what did I say? I will create the\nwhat did I say? I will create the\nwhat did I say? I will create the dynamic workers, right? Let's say there\ndynamic workers, right? Let's say there\ndynamic workers, right? Let's say there are three tasks or three workers, five\nare three tasks or three workers, five\nare three tasks or three workers, five task, five workers, seven task, seven\ntask, five workers, seven task, seven\ntask, five workers, seven task, seven workers and so many other things. So\nworkers and so many other things. So\nworkers and so many other things. So what we can do instead of using the\nwhat we can do instead of using the\nwhat we can do instead of using the default workers I will simply say\ndefault workers I will simply say\ndefault workers I will simply say workers or you can say max workers\nworkers or you can say max workers\nworkers or you can say max workers equals length of task.\nequals length of task.\nequals length of task. Okay length of task. So now if in my\nOkay length of task. So now if in my\nOkay length of task. So now if in my tasks list if there are two task then\ntasks list if there are two task then\ntasks list if there are two task then two workers will be working in parallel.\ntwo workers will be working in parallel.\ntwo workers will be working in parallel. If three task three workers will be\nIf three task three workers will be\nIf three task three workers will be running in parallel. Five task five\nrunning in parallel. Five task five\nrunning in parallel. Five task five workers will be running in parallel.\nworkers will be running in parallel.\nworkers will be running in parallel. Simple that's how it works. Now I will\nSimple that's how it works. Now I will\nSimple that's how it works. Now I will use the map map map function like there\nuse the map map map function like there\nuse the map map map function like there are multiple ways to use thread pool\nare multiple ways to use thread pool\nare multiple ways to use thread pool executor. My way is I will simply say\nexecutor. My way is I will simply say\nexecutor. My way is I will simply say results\nresults\nresults okay or let's say results um\nokay or let's say results um\nokay or let's say results um futures because that is a kind of naming\nfutures because that is a kind of naming\nfutures because that is a kind of naming convention we use results futures equals\nconvention we use results futures equals\nconvention we use results futures equals to I will use executor or let's say map\nto I will use executor or let's say map\nto I will use executor or let's say map function. So map function what this map\nfunction. So map function what this map\nfunction. So map function what this map function will do let me just tell you.\nfunction will do let me just tell you.\nfunction will do let me just tell you. So let's say you have a function okay\nSo let's say you have a function okay\nSo let's say you have a function okay this is your function you can map this\nthis is your function you can map this\nthis is your function you can map this function to the entire list so that\nfunction to the entire list so that\nfunction to the entire list so that let's say 1 2 3 so this map function\nlet's say 1 2 3 so this map function\nlet's say 1 2 3 so this map function will be applied to this to this and to\nwill be applied to this to this and to\nwill be applied to this to this and to this again Python fundamentals okay so\nthis again Python fundamentals okay so\nthis again Python fundamentals okay so you need to know that how we can just\nyou need to know that how we can just\nyou need to know that how we can just apply the map okay so I will simply say\napply the map okay so I will simply say\napply the map okay so I will simply say executor do map okay and what I need to\nexecutor do map okay and what I need to\nexecutor do map okay and what I need to map like which function the function is\nmap like which function the function is\nmap like which function the function is execute that we just created here\nexecute that we just created here\nexecute that we just created here here and to which list I want to apply\nhere and to which list I want to apply\nhere and to which list I want to apply this tasks obviously. Simple. So now do\nthis tasks obviously. Simple. So now do\nthis tasks obviously. Simple. So now do you know what will happen? This tasks\nyou know what will happen? This tasks\nyou know what will happen? This tasks list\nlist\nlist this tasks list\nthis tasks list\nthis tasks list will act as the input for my execute\nwill act as the input for my execute\nwill act as the input for my execute function. Oh, so whatever I have written\nfunction. Oh, so whatever I have written\nfunction. Oh, so whatever I have written in the tasks in the you can say in this\nin the tasks in the you can say in this\nin the tasks in the you can say in this particular thing. So let's say if my\nparticular thing. So let's say if my\nparticular thing. So let's say if my task is having one item, second item,\ntask is having one item, second item,\ntask is having one item, second item, third item, right? So that item will\nthird item, right? So that item will\nthird item, right? So that item will become the input for my function. So\nbecome the input for my function. So\nbecome the input for my function. So just be very careful if you just want to\njust be very careful if you just want to\njust be very careful if you just want to use this feature in future. Okay? Um\nuse this feature in future. Okay? Um\nuse this feature in future. Okay? Um maybe in any other workflow. Just make\nmaybe in any other workflow. Just make\nmaybe in any other workflow. Just make sure that the item should match the data\nsure that the item should match the data\nsure that the item should match the data type of this function. If let's say in\ntype of this function. If let's say in\ntype of this function. If let's say in my list I am having dictionaries, I can\nmy list I am having dictionaries, I can\nmy list I am having dictionaries, I can have dictionaries, right? dictionaries\nhave dictionaries, right? dictionaries\nhave dictionaries, right? dictionaries of a list of dictionaries then this data\nof a list of dictionaries then this data\nof a list of dictionaries then this data type cannot be string this will also be\ntype cannot be string this will also be\ntype cannot be string this will also be like dictionary and then you can fetch\nlike dictionary and then you can fetch\nlike dictionary and then you can fetch the values from that dictionary again\nthe values from that dictionary again\nthe values from that dictionary again highle things so do not worry about that\nhighle things so do not worry about that\nhighle things so do not worry about that see you will learn gradually do not feel\nsee you will learn gradually do not feel\nsee you will learn gradually do not feel like like you do not know the things\nlike like you do not know the things\nlike like you do not know the things it's all about time it's all about\nit's all about time it's all about\nit's all about time it's all about practice it's all about playing and\npractice it's all about playing and\npractice it's all about playing and experimenting okay so it's fine if you\nexperimenting okay so it's fine if you\nexperimenting okay so it's fine if you do not know about the things you are\ndo not know about the things you are\ndo not know about the things you are landed on the perfect channel just\nlanded on the perfect channel just\nlanded on the perfect channel just subscribe to this channel you will know\nsubscribe to this channel you will know\nsubscribe to this channel you will know everything okay so results futures are\neverything okay so results futures are\neverything okay so results futures are here so what will happen now Now all of\nhere so what will happen now Now all of\nhere so what will happen now Now all of the threads will be running in parallel.\nthe threads will be running in parallel.\nthe threads will be running in parallel. Yes. And now I can just save the results\nYes. And now I can just save the results\nYes. And now I can just save the results of every task smartly. Do you know how?\nof every task smartly. Do you know how?\nof every task smartly. Do you know how? Within the context manager. I will\nWithin the context manager. I will\nWithin the context manager. I will simply say for result in results future.\nsimply say for result in results future.\nsimply say for result in results future. Okay. And then I can append my this\nOkay. And then I can append my this\nOkay. And then I can append my this empty results. Okay. Because we have to\nempty results. Okay. Because we have to\nempty results. Okay. Because we have to do it in the context manager otherwise\ndo it in the context manager otherwise\ndo it in the context manager otherwise once this um context manager is um you\nonce this um context manager is um you\nonce this um context manager is um you can say completed or executed completely\ncan say completed or executed completely\ncan say completed or executed completely then it will not save the results. It\nthen it will not save the results. It\nthen it will not save the results. It will simply release it. So we have to\nwill simply release it. So we have to\nwill simply release it. So we have to store it immediately within the context\nstore it immediately within the context\nstore it immediately within the context manager. This is the code and then I can\nmanager. This is the code and then I can\nmanager. This is the code and then I can simply update it. Return state. Simple.\nsimply update it. Return state. Simple.\nsimply update it. Return state. Simple. This is the code that we need to build.\nThis is the code that we need to build.\nThis is the code that we need to build. Simple.\nSimple.\nSimple. Wow. Okay. This is the 90% of the work.\nWow. Okay. This is the 90% of the work.\nWow. Okay. This is the 90% of the work. Now 10% of the work is like collector\nNow 10% of the work is like collector\nNow 10% of the work is like collector node which is the optional thing that\nnode which is the optional thing that\nnode which is the optional thing that you want to let's say collect all of the\nyou want to let's say collect all of the\nyou want to let's say collect all of the things and you want to say like what you\nthings and you want to say like what you\nthings and you want to say like what you have done and blah blah blah blah blah.\nhave done and blah blah blah blah blah.\nhave done and blah blah blah blah blah. Right? Let's do it because that is also\nRight? Let's do it because that is also\nRight? Let's do it because that is also a good feature to know. So let's say\na good feature to know. So let's say\na good feature to know. So let's say your results is also populated with the\nyour results is also populated with the\nyour results is also populated with the AI messages right obviously. So what I\nAI messages right obviously. So what I\nAI messages right obviously. So what I will do I will create one node and I\nwill do I will create one node and I\nwill do I will create one node and I will say\nwill say\nwill say collector node. So this collector node\ncollector node. So this collector node\ncollector node. So this collector node will do nothing. It will simply say\ncollector node and this will take this\ncollector node and this will take this and\nand\nand this will say I think it suggested a\nthis will say I think it suggested a\nthis will say I think it suggested a good thing results. Okay, results we can\ngood thing results. Okay, results we can\ngood thing results. Okay, results we can just fetch prompt. You are a collector\njust fetch prompt. You are a collector\njust fetch prompt. You are a collector that summarize. Yes, exactly. So this\nthat summarize. Yes, exactly. So this\nthat summarize. Yes, exactly. So this prompt is a good one. You are a\nprompt is a good one. You are a\nprompt is a good one. You are a collector that summarizes the results\ncollector that summarizes the results\ncollector that summarizes the results from the worker. Very good. And here are\nfrom the worker. Very good. And here are\nfrom the worker. Very good. And here are the results. We can just pass the\nthe results. We can just pass the\nthe results. We can just pass the results list and please summarize these\nresults list and please summarize these\nresults list and please summarize these results in a concise manner. Perfect.\nresults in a concise manner. Perfect.\nresults in a concise manner. Perfect. And then we simply need to invoke the\nAnd then we simply need to invoke the\nAnd then we simply need to invoke the LLM and that's it. So our summary is\nLLM and that's it. So our summary is\nLLM and that's it. So our summary is also created. See, so now our all the\nalso created. See, so now our all the\nalso created. See, so now our all the keys of the schema are generated. Simple\nkeys of the schema are generated. Simple\nkeys of the schema are generated. Simple date. Perfect. So that's it. That's it.\ndate. Perfect. So that's it. That's it.\ndate. Perfect. So that's it. That's it. That's it. Now finally what? Simple. Now\nThat's it. Now finally what? Simple. Now\nThat's it. Now finally what? Simple. Now that you can say favorite part crafting\nthat you can say favorite part crafting\nthat you can say favorite part crafting the graph. Now I will simply say\ncreating graph and executing simple. So\ncreating graph and executing simple. So here we can say um graph\nhere we can say um graph\nhere we can say um graph let's say from\nstate graph\nstate graph start and\nstart and\nstart and very good and bro if you understood this\nvery good and bro if you understood this\nvery good and bro if you understood this concept then obviously tap your back\nconcept then obviously tap your back\nconcept then obviously tap your back because this is not an easy one to\nbecause this is not an easy one to\nbecause this is not an easy one to understand and yes I put my best efforts\nunderstand and yes I put my best efforts\nunderstand and yes I put my best efforts to explain the things you put double\nto explain the things you put double\nto explain the things you put double extra efforts to understand it. So it's\nextra efforts to understand it. So it's\nextra efforts to understand it. So it's a good win for you and you should\na good win for you and you should\na good win for you and you should celebrate it. Okay, simple. Let me be\ncelebrate it. Okay, simple. Let me be\ncelebrate it. Okay, simple. Let me be honest with you. This is not a very easy\nhonest with you. This is not a very easy\nhonest with you. This is not a very easy thing to understand. Okay, very good.\nthing to understand. Okay, very good.\nthing to understand. Okay, very good. Very good. Very good. So now let's build\nVery good. Very good. So now let's build\nVery good. Very good. So now let's build the graph. So graph equals to state\nthe graph. So graph equals to state\nthe graph. So graph equals to state graph\ngraph\ngraph and graph schema. Perfect.\nand graph schema. Perfect.\nand graph schema. Perfect. Graph dot\nGraph dot\nGraph dot add edge.\nadd edge.\nadd edge. Not add edge. add node. So first of all\nNot add edge. add node. So first of all\nNot add edge. add node. So first of all I will create the node for orchestrator\nbro order pizza.\nbro order pizza. Do you know what I am hungry?\nDo you know what I am hungry?\nDo you know what I am hungry? Orchestrator node\nOrchestrator node\nOrchestrator node and the function is orchestrator node.\nand the function is orchestrator node.\nand the function is orchestrator node. Perfect. Then I want to create worker\nPerfect. Then I want to create worker\nPerfect. Then I want to create worker node. Um yes. Then I want to create\nnode. Um yes. Then I want to create\nnode. Um yes. Then I want to create collector node. Yes. Perfect. Now let's\ncollector node. Yes. Perfect. Now let's\ncollector node. Yes. Perfect. Now let's create the edges. So it will start from\ncreate the edges. So it will start from\ncreate the edges. So it will start from orchestrator. Then it will go to worker\norchestrator. Then it will go to worker\norchestrator. Then it will go to worker and then collector and then end simple.\nand then collector and then end simple.\nand then collector and then end simple. And then let's say compile\nequals\nequals graph.compile and let's see that\ngraph.compile and let's see that\ngraph.compile and let's see that particular thing the visualized graph\nparticular thing the visualized graph\nparticular thing the visualized graph just to make sure like our graph is\njust to make sure like our graph is\njust to make sure like our graph is fine. So this is the code for it.\nSo here we can say complex graph perfect\nSo here we can say complex graph perfect orchestrator node is not defined very\norchestrator node is not defined very\norchestrator node is not defined very good because we didn't define it like we\ngood because we didn't define it like we\ngood because we didn't define it like we didn't run this let me just run let me\ndidn't run this let me just run let me\ndidn't run this let me just run let me just click on run all simple\nperfect perfect\nperfect perfect graph perfect now the beauty of this\ngraph perfect now the beauty of this\ngraph perfect now the beauty of this graph is it looks very simple but we\ngraph is it looks very simple but we\ngraph is it looks very simple but we know that\nknow that\nknow that what's going on here And what's going on\nwhat's going on here And what's going on\nwhat's going on here And what's going on here? Right? So well done. And now let's\nhere? Right? So well done. And now let's\nhere? Right? So well done. And now let's try to execute our graph. Simple.\ntry to execute our graph. Simple.\ntry to execute our graph. Simple. So I'll simply say\nSo I'll simply say\nSo I'll simply say complex graph\ncomplex graph\ncomplex graph dot invoke. And then I can say\ndot invoke. And then I can say\ndot invoke. And then I can say uh first of all query. I will say query\nwhat is the capital of France? What is\nwhat is the capital of France? What is the population Paris? Let's see. And\nthe population Paris? Let's see. And\nthe population Paris? Let's see. And let's add one more thing. And\nlet's add one more thing. And\nlet's add one more thing. And what is the\nwhat is the\nwhat is the capital of Germany and what is the\ncapital of Germany and what is the\ncapital of Germany and what is the population of Berlin? Wow.\npopulation of Berlin? Wow.\npopulation of Berlin? Wow. Let's perform all of these things. So we\nLet's perform all of these things. So we\nLet's perform all of these things. So we have query ready. Now what do we have\nhave query ready. Now what do we have\nhave query ready. Now what do we have next? We have I think tasks and we do\nnext? We have I think tasks and we do\nnext? We have I think tasks and we do not need to pass anything. So it will be\nnot need to pass anything. So it will be\nnot need to pass anything. So it will be like empty list. Results will be empty\nlike empty list. Results will be empty\nlike empty list. Results will be empty list. Summary will be empty thing.\nlist. Summary will be empty thing.\nlist. Summary will be empty thing. Simple. Now let's try to invoke it. Now\nSimple. Now let's try to invoke it. Now\nSimple. Now let's try to invoke it. Now let's see what do we get. So we should\nlet's see what do we get. So we should\nlet's see what do we get. So we should see first of all tasks as well. We\nsee first of all tasks as well. We\nsee first of all tasks as well. We should see results as well and we should\nshould see results as well and we should\nshould see results as well and we should see obviously summary as well. So we\nsee obviously summary as well.

So now let's talk about our other architecture\nabout our other architecture\nabout our other architecture and it's called\nand it's called\nand it's called evaluator optimizer and it is also\nevaluator optimizer and it is also\nevaluator optimizer and it is also called as um generate and critique. It\ncalled as um generate and critique. It\ncalled as um generate and critique. It has like so many names but let's use the\nhas like so many names but let's use the\nhas like so many names but let's use the name which is written in langra but I'm\nname which is written in langra but I'm\nname which is written in langra but I'm simply telling you if you just see this\nsimply telling you if you just see this\nsimply telling you if you just see this name let's say critique or I think there\nname let's say critique or I think there\nname let's say critique or I think there was a very popular name um it was called\nwas a very popular name um it was called\nwas a very popular name um it was called as let me check I guess I wrote it\nas let me check I guess I wrote it\nas let me check I guess I wrote it somewhere uh\nsomewhere uh\nsomewhere uh generator evaluator oh yeah generator\ngenerator evaluator oh yeah generator\ngenerator evaluator oh yeah generator evaluator so this is called evaluator\nevaluator so this is called evaluator\nevaluator so this is called evaluator optimizer you can also call it as\noptimizer you can also call it as\noptimizer you can also call it as generator evaluator you can also call it\ngenerator evaluator you can also call it\ngenerator evaluator you can also call it as generator and critique okay there are\nas generator and critique okay there are\nas generator and critique okay there are so many names but the concept is\nso many names but the concept is\nso many names but the concept is absolutely same okay because do you know\nabsolutely same okay because do you know\nabsolutely same okay because do you know what let me just explain like what will\nwhat let me just explain like what will\nwhat let me just explain like what will happen so let me just take you to my\nhappen so let me just take you to my\nhappen so let me just take you to my whiteboard so I will simply say\nwhiteboard so I will simply say\nwhiteboard so I will simply say generator evaluator that's a good name\ngenerator evaluator that's a good name\ngenerator evaluator that's a good name generator\ngenerator\ngenerator evaluator because I want to use those\nevaluator because I want to use those\nevaluator because I want to use those terms which you can understand better\nterms which you can understand better\nterms which you can understand better generator evaluator simple so now what\ngenerator evaluator simple so now what\ngenerator evaluator simple so now what will happen you will go to this let's\nwill happen you will go to this let's\nwill happen you will go to this let's say node\nsay node\nsay node Okay, with some query\nOkay, with some query\nOkay, with some query simple you asked something.\nsimple you asked something.\nsimple you asked something. Okay, now what will happen? Now\nOkay, now what will happen? Now\nOkay, now what will happen? Now obviously this LLM node will generate\nobviously this LLM node will generate\nobviously this LLM node will generate something. Yes, but here let's say this\nsomething. Yes, but here let's say this\nsomething. Yes, but here let's say this is a generate node.\nNo, it generate node. Okay, so let's say\nNo, it generate node. Okay, so let's say this is generate node. This will only\nthis is generate node. This will only\nthis is generate node. This will only generate the tasks but there should be\ngenerate the tasks but there should be\ngenerate the tasks but there should be someone who can evaluate that the\nsomeone who can evaluate that the\nsomeone who can evaluate that the generated answer is correct, generated\ngenerated answer is correct, generated\ngenerated answer is correct, generated answer is good, generated answer is like\nanswer is good, generated answer is like\nanswer is good, generated answer is like ready to go. So there should be someone\nready to go. So there should be someone\nready to go. So there should be someone right. So yes, we can create one more\nright. So yes, we can create one more\nright. So yes, we can create one more node and we can call it as let's say\nnode and we can call it as let's say\nnode and we can call it as let's say evaluator.\nevaluator.\nevaluator. Okay, generator and evaluator.\nOkay, generator and evaluator.\nOkay, generator and evaluator. So this will do what?\nSo this will do what?\nSo this will do what? This will evaluate the answer generated\nThis will evaluate the answer generated\nThis will evaluate the answer generated by this node.\nby this node.\nby this node. Okay. Yeah. This will evaluate the\nOkay. Yeah. This will evaluate the\nOkay. Yeah. This will evaluate the answer.\nanswer.\nanswer. If\nIf\nIf if the answer is good, then it will\nif the answer is good, then it will\nif the answer is good, then it will simply say okay, I am satisfied with\nsimply say okay, I am satisfied with\nsimply say okay, I am satisfied with this thing\nthis thing\nthis thing and it's good to go. Simple.\nand it's good to go. Simple.\nand it's good to go. Simple. Okay. But if the answer is not good\nOkay. But if the answer is not good\nOkay. But if the answer is not good enough, let's say it's not good enough,\nenough, let's say it's not good enough,\nenough, let's say it's not good enough, so it will simply send it back to this\nso it will simply send it back to this\nso it will simply send it back to this generate node. Hey, just correct it\ngenerate node. Hey, just correct it\ngenerate node. Hey, just correct it because it is not good. Simple. This is\nbecause it is not good. Simple. This is\nbecause it is not good. Simple. This is the entire architecture for this\nthe entire architecture for this\nthe entire architecture for this generator evaluator.\ngenerator evaluator.\ngenerator evaluator. Simple. Now you can just ask this\nSimple. Now you can just ask this\nSimple. Now you can just ask this question if you are smart. Okay? And I\nquestion if you are smart. Okay? And I\nquestion if you are smart. Okay? And I know you are very smart. This can end up\nknow you are very smart. This can end up\nknow you are very smart. This can end up in the infinite loop. Let's say our\nin the infinite loop. Let's say our\nin the infinite loop. Let's say our evaluator node is like very strict. It\nevaluator node is like very strict. It\nevaluator node is like very strict. It is like every time saying hey this is\nis like every time saying hey this is\nis like every time saying hey this is not good. Hey this is not good. Hey this\nnot good. Hey this is not good. Hey this\nnot good. Hey this is not good. Hey this is not good just like your favorite\nis not good just like your favorite\nis not good just like your favorite class teacher whenever you submit the\nclass teacher whenever you submit the\nclass teacher whenever you submit the homework. So in that scenario it will\nhomework. So in that scenario it will\nhomework. So in that scenario it will never generate the final answer. Um kind\nnever generate the final answer. Um kind\nnever generate the final answer. Um kind of yes. So in that scenario just for the\nof yes. So in that scenario just for the\nof yes. So in that scenario just for the safer side or you can say just to add a\nsafer side or you can say just to add a\nsafer side or you can say just to add a guardrail so that we do not enter into\nguardrail so that we do not enter into\nguardrail so that we do not enter into the infinite loop we can create the\nthe infinite loop we can create the\nthe infinite loop we can create the maximum iterations like we can set the\nmaximum iterations like we can set the\nmaximum iterations like we can set the maximum iterations number. So maximum\nmaximum iterations number. So maximum\nmaximum iterations number. So maximum iterations number will be let's say\niterations number will be let's say\niterations number will be let's say three or let's say 10. So yes evaluator\nthree or let's say 10. So yes evaluator\nthree or let's say 10. So yes evaluator can reject the answer but not more than\ncan reject the answer but not more than\ncan reject the answer but not more than 10 times right not more than three times\n10 times right not more than three times\n10 times right not more than three times not more than four times like this\nnot more than four times like this\nnot more than four times like this make sense. So that's how you can say\nmake sense. So that's how you can say\nmake sense. So that's how you can say generator evaluator or generator\ngenerator evaluator or generator\ngenerator evaluator or generator critique because this can act as a\ncritique because this can act as a\ncritique because this can act as a critique.\ncritique.\ncritique. Okay, this can act as a critique. Okay,\nOkay, this can act as a critique. Okay,\nOkay, this can act as a critique. Okay, or you can say it is a kind of I like\nor you can say it is a kind of I like\nor you can say it is a kind of I like this word generator evaluator because\nthis word generator evaluator because\nthis word generator evaluator because this is a good one like this is a better\nthis is a good one like this is a better\nthis is a good one like this is a better way to understand this thing. Okay. So\nway to understand this thing. Okay. So\nway to understand this thing. Okay. So now what exactly we need to do? We will\nnow what exactly we need to do? We will\nnow what exactly we need to do? We will just use the piantic here as well. Why?\njust use the piantic here as well. Why?\njust use the piantic here as well. Why? Because let me just tell you. So let's\nBecause let me just tell you. So let's\nBecause let me just tell you. So let's say my query is let's generate a joke.\nsay my query is let's generate a joke.\nsay my query is let's generate a joke. Okay. So generate node will generate a\nOkay. So generate node will generate a\nOkay. So generate node will generate a joke obviously.\njoke obviously.\njoke obviously. Now evaluator\nNow evaluator\nNow evaluator will consider the joke as funny or not\nwill consider the joke as funny or not\nwill consider the joke as funny or not or funny or not. Make sense? Okay. Now\nor funny or not. Make sense? Okay. Now\nor funny or not. Make sense? Okay. Now you will say how evaluator node knows\nyou will say how evaluator node knows\nyou will say how evaluator node knows that joke is funny or not. Obviously we\nthat joke is funny or not. Obviously we\nthat joke is funny or not. Obviously we do not have AGI for now. So now we can\ndo not have AGI for now. So now we can\ndo not have AGI for now. So now we can just add some hints. Let's say if\njust add some hints. Let's say if\njust add some hints. Let's say if there's a punch line, if there's an ex\nthere's a punch line, if there's an ex\nthere's a punch line, if there's an ex exclamation mark because whenever you\nexclamation mark because whenever you\nexclamation mark because whenever you are just writing a joke, you have to\nare just writing a joke, you have to\nare just writing a joke, you have to make some pauses within the you can say\nmake some pauses within the you can say\nmake some pauses within the you can say between the joke statement or whatever.\nbetween the joke statement or whatever.\nbetween the joke statement or whatever. Okay, if you have ever made any joke. So\nOkay, if you have ever made any joke. So\nOkay, if you have ever made any joke. So you have to just take some pauses and\nyou have to just take some pauses and\nyou have to just take some pauses and while you will be just writing the joke,\nwhile you will be just writing the joke,\nwhile you will be just writing the joke, you have to demonstrate that you are\nyou have to demonstrate that you are\nyou have to demonstrate that you are taking the pause. So let's say I will\ntaking the pause. So let's say I will\ntaking the pause. So let's say I will say add some exclamation mark. I will\nsay add some exclamation mark. I will\nsay add some exclamation mark. I will add some generic rules so that evaluator\nadd some generic rules so that evaluator\nadd some generic rules so that evaluator can better understand the joke.\ncan better understand the joke.\ncan better understand the joke. Simple and then it will provide the\nSimple and then it will provide the\nSimple and then it will provide the feedback on the on the basis of it or\nfeedback on the on the basis of it or\nfeedback on the on the basis of it or you can say it will simply say okay this\nyou can say it will simply say okay this\nyou can say it will simply say okay this joke is is this joke joke this joke is\njoke is is this joke joke this joke is\njoke is is this joke joke this joke is good simple. So it can simply say funny\ngood simple. So it can simply say funny\ngood simple. So it can simply say funny or not funny and then it can simply\nor not funny and then it can simply\nor not funny and then it can simply provide the feedback\nprovide the feedback\nprovide the feedback and this feedback will go back to the\nand this feedback will go back to the\nand this feedback will go back to the generate node\ngenerate node\ngenerate node simple and then it can improve the joke\nsimple and then it can improve the joke\nsimple and then it can improve the joke simple and the maximum iterations for\nsimple and the maximum iterations for\nsimple and the maximum iterations for this will be let's say three three or\nthis will be let's say three three or\nthis will be let's say three three or five let's say five simple so now let's\nfive let's say five simple so now let's\nfive let's say five simple so now let's try to create this thing in our VS code\ntry to create this thing in our VS code\ntry to create this thing in our VS code editor so let's try to do this so what\neditor so let's try to do this so what\neditor so let's try to do this so what we need to do first of all let's try to\nwe need to do first of all let's try to\nwe need to do first of all let's try to copy this Uh let me just say 10\ngenerator\ngenerator evaluator.\nOkay, generator evaluator.\nOkay, generator evaluator. Let's see. So first of all, this is\nLet's see. So first of all, this is\nLet's see. So first of all, this is same. Let me just select the kernel\nand llm. Now let's change the pientic\nand llm. Now let's change the pientic schema. So here we do not need to create\nschema. So here we do not need to create\nschema. So here we do not need to create any tasks and all tasks and all. So here\nany tasks and all tasks and all. So here\nany tasks and all tasks and all. So here I first of all need to create\nI first of all need to create\nI first of all need to create um joke flag or you can say funny flag.\num joke flag or you can say funny flag.\num joke flag or you can say funny flag. Okay,\nOkay,\nOkay, funny flag. This will be not boolean. I\nfunny flag. This will be not boolean. I\nfunny flag. This will be not boolean. I can simply say boolean but I want to\ncan simply say boolean but I want to\ncan simply say boolean but I want to keep it as let's say literal. Literal is\nkeep it as let's say literal. Literal is\nkeep it as let's say literal. Literal is a better way to work with it. And\na better way to work with it. And\na better way to work with it. And literal of string.\nliteral of string.\nliteral of string. Simple. Uh let me just pick the literal\nSimple. Uh let me just pick the literal\nSimple. Uh let me just pick the literal from here.\nfrom here.\nfrom here. Simple.\nSimple.\nSimple. So literal of string. So this will do\nSo literal of string. So this will do\nSo literal of string. So this will do what? What's wrong with you, bro?\nwhat? What's wrong with you, bro?\nwhat? What's wrong with you, bro? Literal of Oh, makes sense. Literal of\nLiteral of Oh, makes sense. Literal of\nLiteral of Oh, makes sense. Literal of funny and not funny.\nfunny and not funny.\nfunny and not funny. Simple. Very good. Funny and not funny.\nSimple. Very good. Funny and not funny.\nSimple. Very good. Funny and not funny. And you can provide some description\nAnd you can provide some description\nAnd you can provide some description whether the joke is funny or not.\nwhether the joke is funny or not.\nwhether the joke is funny or not. Simple. Now what I will do? I will\nSimple. Now what I will do? I will\nSimple. Now what I will do? I will simply attach this with our LLM.\nsimply attach this with our LLM.\nsimply attach this with our LLM. Simple. Now we do not need to test it\nSimple. Now we do not need to test it\nSimple. Now we do not need to test it here because we have not provided any\nhere because we have not provided any\nhere because we have not provided any kind of instructions like how to judge\nkind of instructions like how to judge\nkind of instructions like how to judge that it is a funny or not. It is just\nthat it is a funny or not. It is just\nthat it is a funny or not. It is just the way to tell LLM that you just need\nthe way to tell LLM that you just need\nthe way to tell LLM that you just need to generate the output with this\nto generate the output with this\nto generate the output with this particular key in it and obviously\nparticular key in it and obviously\nparticular key in it and obviously either this value or that value. But\neither this value or that value. But\neither this value or that value. But obviously if you will just try to um\nobviously if you will just try to um\nobviously if you will just try to um test it hey lm with schema.invoke and we\ntest it hey lm with schema.invoke and we\ntest it hey lm with schema.invoke and we will write a joke and you will see let's\nwill write a joke and you will see let's\nwill write a joke and you will see let's see what what it will return. It it\nsee what what it will return. It it\nsee what what it will return. It it doesn't know like how to say funny or\ndoesn't know like how to say funny or\ndoesn't know like how to say funny or not funny. For that particular thing, we\nnot funny. For that particular thing, we\nnot funny. For that particular thing, we have to provide the prompt, right? So\nhave to provide the prompt, right? So\nhave to provide the prompt, right? So that prompt will be provided during the\nthat prompt will be provided during the\nthat prompt will be provided during the invocation.\ninvocation.\ninvocation. Okay? Or if you just want to test it,\nOkay? Or if you just want to test it,\nOkay? Or if you just want to test it, you have to provide the prompt within\nyou have to provide the prompt within\nyou have to provide the prompt within the query. So you will simply say,\nthe query.

That's it. Very good. Now after creating this thing we\ngood. Now after creating this thing we\ngood. Now after creating this thing we obviously need to update the joke which\nobviously need to update the joke which\nobviously need to update the joke which is joke or let's say state\nis joke or let's say state\nis joke or let's say state of joke equals to response and I will\nof joke equals to response and I will\nof joke equals to response and I will say response doc content because I don't\nsay response doc content because I don't\nsay response doc content because I don't want to save those those metadata. Okay\nwant to save those those metadata. Okay\nwant to save those those metadata. Okay so state of joke equals to this and\nso state of joke equals to this and\nso state of joke equals to this and return state. So this is done. Very well\nreturn state. So this is done. Very well\nreturn state. So this is done. Very well done.\ndone.\ndone. Now let's create the node for our\nNow let's create the node for our\nNow let's create the node for our evaluator. This is very important. So I\nevaluator. This is very important. So I\nevaluator. This is very important. So I have written the detailed um you can say\nhave written the detailed um you can say\nhave written the detailed um you can say prompt for it and I will just share it\nprompt for it and I will just share it\nprompt for it and I will just share it with you. Don't worry. df and evaluate\nwith you. Don't worry. df and evaluate\nwith you. Don't worry. df and evaluate node. So now we need to evaluate the\nnode. So now we need to evaluate the\nnode. So now we need to evaluate the node uh joke. So now you can be the\nnode uh joke. So now you can be the\nnode uh joke. So now you can be the strict teacher of the classroom. Now you\nstrict teacher of the classroom. Now you\nstrict teacher of the classroom. Now you need to evaluate the homework. So you\nneed to evaluate the homework. So you\nneed to evaluate the homework. So you generated this joke. Let me just read it\ngenerated this joke. Let me just read it\ngenerated this joke. Let me just read it and let me just see like what you have\nand let me just see like what you have\nand let me just see like what you have generated. So you can just behave like\ngenerated. So you can just behave like\ngenerated. So you can just behave like this, right? Okay. So now what you can\nthis, right? Okay. So now what you can\nthis, right? Okay. So now what you can do you can simply write a prompt. Okay.\ndo you can simply write a prompt. Okay.\ndo you can simply write a prompt. Okay.

So it will be like let's say so I have to convert\nbe like let's say so I have to convert\nbe like let's say so I have to convert it because I just wrote it um few hours\nit because I just wrote it um few hours\nit because I just wrote it um few hours back. So this is the first of all let me\nback. So this is the first of all let me\nback. So this is the first of all let me just prepare some of the things. So uh\njust prepare some of the things. So uh\njust prepare some of the things. So uh first of all I need to fetch the joke.\nfirst of all I need to fetch the joke.\nfirst of all I need to fetch the joke. So let's say this is a joke and who told\nSo let's say this is a joke and who told\nSo let's say this is a joke and who told you to complete everything? So joke is\nyou to complete everything? So joke is\nyou to complete everything? So joke is state of joke. Now you need to evaluate.\nstate of joke. Now you need to evaluate.\nstate of joke. Now you need to evaluate. So I will simply write the prompt. Okay.\nSo I will simply write the prompt. Okay.\nSo I will simply write the prompt. Okay.

And provide feedback on how to make it funny. Okay. Now I will write\nto make it funny. Okay. Now I will write\nto make it funny. Okay. Now I will write that prompt that I have written. So this\nthat prompt that I have written. So this\nthat prompt that I have written. So this is this particular thing because I I\nis this particular thing because I I\nis this particular thing because I I added some um you can say patterns\nadded some um you can say patterns\nadded some um you can say patterns evaluate the following job response with\nevaluate the following job response with\nevaluate the following job response with funny or not. Uh perfect because you\nfunny or not. Uh perfect because you\nfunny or not. Uh perfect because you have to be very very specific and you\nhave to be very very specific and you\nhave to be very very specific and you have to write this thing. This is very\nhave to write this thing. This is very\nhave to write this thing. This is very important response with funny not funny.\nimportant response with funny not funny.\nimportant response with funny not funny. Even we have attached our LLM with\nEven we have attached our LLM with\nEven we have attached our LLM with structured schema still you should guide\nstructured schema still you should guide\nstructured schema still you should guide in the prompt that you need to respond\nin the prompt that you need to respond\nin the prompt that you need to respond with funny or not funny. It is a good\nwith funny or not funny. It is a good\nwith funny or not funny. It is a good practice. Simple.\npractice. Simple.\npractice. Simple. And provide feedback if it's not funny.\nAnd provide feedback if it's not funny.\nAnd provide feedback if it's not funny. Simple.\nSimple.\nSimple. Okay. So now let's try to\ninvoke it. And then I can say uh my\ninvoke it. And then I can say uh my chain. Okay. And chain will be prompt\nchain. Okay. And chain will be prompt\nchain. Okay. And chain will be prompt and then lm schema.

And while invoking it, I need to pass\nAnd while invoking it, I need to pass\nAnd while invoking it, I need to pass some things such as joke\nsome things such as joke\nsome things such as joke and joke is joke and anything else. No.\nand joke is joke and anything else. No.\nand joke is joke and anything else. No. Very good. And then I can say state of\nVery good. And then I can say state of\nVery good. And then I can say state of funny flag will be response. Funny flag\nfunny flag will be response. Funny flag\nfunny flag will be response. Funny flag and state of feedback will be response\nand state of feedback will be response\nand state of feedback will be response feedback. Perfect. Return state. And one\nfeedback. Perfect. Return state. And one\nfeedback. Perfect. Return state. And one more thing just tell me that what what\nmore thing just tell me that what what\nmore thing just tell me that what what is left. We also need to increment the\nis left. We also need to increment the\nis left. We also need to increment the iteration, right? so that we do not make\niteration, right? so that we do not make\niteration, right? so that we do not make more than five iterations right so first\nmore than five iterations right so first\nmore than five iterations right so first of all I will get the iterations\nof all I will get the iterations\nof all I will get the iterations so let's say\nso let's say\nso let's say iteration\niteration\niteration equals to state of max iterations\nequals to state of max iterations\nequals to state of max iterations perfect so let's say this is zero for\nperfect so let's say this is zero for\nperfect so let's say this is zero for now for the first time so here I will\nnow for the first time so here I will\nnow for the first time so here I will simply say state of max iterations\nsimply say state of max iterations\nsimply say state of max iterations equals to iteration + one so every time\nequals to iteration + one so every time\nequals to iteration + one so every time it will be just keep on appending or not\nit will be just keep on appending or not\nit will be just keep on appending or not appending like adding one one one one to\nappending like adding one one one one to\nappending like adding one one one one to the iteration So that we do not come to\nthe iteration So that we do not come to\nthe iteration So that we do not come to this function more than five times.\nthis function more than five times.\nthis function more than five times. Simple. And here we are done. Our node\nSimple. And here we are done. Our node\nSimple. And here we are done. Our node is done. Now we need to create the nodes\nis done. Now we need to create the nodes\nis done. Now we need to create the nodes and edges.\nand edges.\nand edges. Simple. And if I just go back here. So\nSimple. And if I just go back here. So\nSimple. And if I just go back here. So just tell me one thing here. We need to\njust tell me one thing here. We need to\njust tell me one thing here. We need to create one conditional edge and just\ncreate one conditional edge and just\ncreate one conditional edge and just tell me what is that conditional edge?\ntell me what is that conditional edge?\ntell me what is that conditional edge? The conditional edge is these two. Why?\nThe conditional edge is these two. Why?\nThe conditional edge is these two. Why? Because you do not need to go to this\nBecause you do not need to go to this\nBecause you do not need to go to this evaluate node every time. You only need\nevaluate node every time. You only need\nevaluate node every time. You only need to go to this evaluate node if the value\nto go to this evaluate node if the value\nto go to this evaluate node if the value of maximum iteration is less than equals\nof maximum iteration is less than equals\nof maximum iteration is less than equals to 5. Right? So we will create that\nto 5. Right? So we will create that\nto 5. Right? So we will create that evaluate node. Simple. So\nevaluate node. Simple. So\nevaluate node. Simple. So this is fixed because obviously this\nthis is fixed because obviously this\nthis is fixed because obviously this will go back to the generate node but\nwill go back to the generate node but\nwill go back to the generate node but this is um conditional node or\nthis is um conditional node or\nthis is um conditional node or conditional edge. So let me just create\nconditional edge. So let me just create\nconditional edge. So let me just create that as well.\nconditional edge function.\nconditional edge function. So I will simply say\nSo I will simply say\nSo I will simply say DF\nDF\nDF check iteration.\nOkay, check iteration and let's say this\nOkay, check iteration and let's say this will be returning string.\nwill be returning string.\nwill be returning string. So I will first of all fetch the\nSo I will first of all fetch the\nSo I will first of all fetch the iteration. itteration\niteration. itteration\niteration. itteration equals to state of maximum iterations.\nequals to state of maximum iterations.\nequals to state of maximum iterations. If the iteration is less than equals to\nIf the iteration is less than equals to\nIf the iteration is less than equals to 5 then obviously return\n5 then obviously return\n5 then obviously return the node name and node name let's say\nthe node name and node name let's say\nthe node name and node name let's say our generate\nour generate\nour generate um not generate basically evaluate\nevaluate node simple otherwise return\nevaluate node simple otherwise return end simple return end because we simply\nend simple return end because we simply\nend simple return end because we simply need to generate the final answer simple\nneed to generate the final answer simple\nneed to generate the final answer simple okay make sense okay if I just look back\nokay make sense okay if I just look back\nokay make sense okay if I just look back here um evaluate node. Yeah. So let's\nhere um evaluate node. Yeah. So let's\nhere um evaluate node. Yeah. So let's create one more arrow here because if\ncreate one more arrow here because if\ncreate one more arrow here because if the maxim iterations are have surpassed\nthe maxim iterations are have surpassed\nthe maxim iterations are have surpassed the answer then we can just generate the\nthe answer then we can just generate the\nthe answer then we can just generate the final answer instead of like from here\nfinal answer instead of like from here\nfinal answer instead of like from here we can just generate from here. So it's\nwe can just generate from here. So it's\nwe can just generate from here. So it's fine simple. So let's go and create this\nfine simple. So let's go and create this\nfine simple. So let's go and create this thing as well. Graph schema is not\nthing as well. Graph schema is not\nthing as well. Graph schema is not defined because we haven't run anything.\ndefined because we haven't run anything.\ndefined because we haven't run anything. So let's say run all and perfect. So now\nSo let's say run all and perfect. So now\nSo let's say run all and perfect. So now let's create the graph.\nCreate state graph.\nCreate state graph. And here let's say\nAnd here let's say\nAnd here let's say from\nfrom\nfrom langraph.graph graph\nand so I will say graph equals to state\nand so I will say graph equals to state graph schema generate node evaluate node\ngraph schema generate node evaluate node\ngraph schema generate node evaluate node add edge then add conditional edges\nadd edge then add conditional edges\nadd edge then add conditional edges then generate node\nthen generate node\nthen generate node and check iteration and then obviously\nand check iteration and then obviously\nand check iteration and then obviously the mapping the same mapping that we see\nthe mapping the same mapping that we see\nthe mapping the same mapping that we see error every time. So it will be like\nerror every time. So it will be like\nerror every time. So it will be like first of all\nfirst of all\nfirst of all generate not generate I will say\ngenerate not generate I will say\ngenerate not generate I will say evaluate\nand end is equals to end. Okay perfect.\nand end is equals to end. Okay perfect. So this is also done. So here it is\nSo this is also done. So here it is\nSo this is also done. So here it is done. Now we need to add edge from\ndone. Now we need to add edge from\ndone. Now we need to add edge from evaluate to generate. Okay. And then\nevaluate to generate. Okay. And then\nevaluate to generate. Okay. And then from generate to end.\nfrom generate to end.\nfrom generate to end. Graph dot add edge.\nGenerate node to end. simple just four\nGenerate node to end. simple just four edges\nedges\nedges simple because obviously we will always\nsimple because obviously we will always\nsimple because obviously we will always um end the uh you can say joke with the\num end the uh you can say joke with the\num end the uh you can say joke with the generate node like it's my choice by the\ngenerate node like it's my choice by the\ngenerate node like it's my choice by the way I can\nway I can\nway I can let's say end the process from\nlet's say end the process from\nlet's say end the process from evaluate node as well so what will\nevaluate node as well so what will\nevaluate node as well so what will happen in that particular particular\nhappen in that particular particular\nhappen in that particular particular case so let's say we have let's first of\ncase so let's say we have let's first of\ncase so let's say we have let's first of all compile this just to see like how\nall compile this just to see like how\nall compile this just to see like how our graph looks like right right now\nour graph looks like right right now\nour graph looks like right right now because if I just let's say add the\nbecause if I just let's say add the\nbecause if I just let's say add the conditional edge only the conditional\nconditional edge only the conditional\nconditional edge only the conditional edge Then what will happen? If you see\nedge Then what will happen? If you see\nedge Then what will happen? If you see the conditional edge, we have already\nthe conditional edge, we have already\nthe conditional edge, we have already the end statement here, right? So that\nthe end statement here, right? So that\nthe end statement here, right? So that means it will automatically end the\nmeans it will automatically end the\nmeans it will automatically end the graph if we do not have any kind of\ngraph if we do not have any kind of\ngraph if we do not have any kind of value at node. So we do not need to go\nvalue at node. So we do not need to go\nvalue at node. So we do not need to go back to the generate node after this\nback to the generate node after this\nback to the generate node after this end. So it's my choice. So I can also\nend. So it's my choice. So I can also\nend. So it's my choice. So I can also let's say comment it out um these two.\nlet's say comment it out um these two.\nlet's say comment it out um these two. So I can only create the two or let's\nSo I can only create the two or let's\nSo I can only create the two or let's say three edges. That's it. First of all\nsay three edges. That's it. First of all\nsay three edges. That's it. First of all start. Okay. and then from generate to\nstart. Okay. and then from generate to\nstart. Okay. and then from generate to evaluate\nevaluate\nevaluate in the form of conditional.\nin the form of conditional.\nin the form of conditional. Okay. Okay. Wait, why did we just add\nOkay. Okay. Wait, why did we just add\nOkay. Okay. Wait, why did we just add conditional from generate to evaluate?\nconditional from generate to evaluate?\nconditional from generate to evaluate? Okay, makes sense because that is a kind\nOkay, makes sense because that is a kind\nOkay, makes sense because that is a kind of conditional uh edge because it cannot\nof conditional uh edge because it cannot\nof conditional uh edge because it cannot go every time to the evaluate nodes.\ngo every time to the evaluate nodes.\ngo every time to the evaluate nodes. That's that makes sense. So let's try to\nThat's that makes sense. So let's try to\nThat's that makes sense. So let's try to compile it. Uh\ncompile it. Uh\ncompile it. Uh let's say evaluator\nevaluator graph. You can just give any\nevaluator graph. You can just give any name graph.compile. And let's try to\nname graph.compile. And let's try to\nname graph.compile. And let's try to print it.\nprint it.\nprint it. Let's try to print it.\nSo this is my evaluator graph. Perfect.\nSo this is my evaluator graph. Perfect. Let's see what do we have because I\nLet's see what do we have because I\nLet's see what do we have because I think we can just change some edges. But\nthink we can just change some edges. But\nthink we can just change some edges. But let's see. So currently it is like this.\nlet's see. So currently it is like this.\nlet's see. So currently it is like this. So start generate node and it will go to\nSo start generate node and it will go to\nSo start generate node and it will go to evaluate node only only if the\nevaluate node only only if the\nevaluate node only only if the iterations are more than five otherwise\niterations are more than five otherwise\niterations are more than five otherwise it will not go to evaluate node and this\nit will not go to evaluate node and this\nit will not go to evaluate node and this will simply go back to the generate node\nwill simply go back to the generate node\nwill simply go back to the generate node every time whenever it is coming here.\nevery time whenever it is coming here.\nevery time whenever it is coming here. So it is also kind of thing but you can\nSo it is also kind of thing but you can\nSo it is also kind of thing but you can just redesign it as per you maybe you\njust redesign it as per you maybe you\njust redesign it as per you maybe you want to generate the final answer from\nwant to generate the final answer from\nwant to generate the final answer from um evaluate node. So you can do it like\num evaluate node. So you can do it like\num evaluate node. So you can do it like that as well but this is fine. This is\nthat as well but this is fine. This is\nthat as well but this is fine. This is fine. Now let's try to invoke it.\nPerfect. And let's say\nPerfect. And let's say um\num\num evaluator graph\nevaluator graph dot invoke\nevaluator graph dot invoke and here I need to just provide the\nand here I need to just provide the\nand here I need to just provide the topic. Oh yeah that is perfect. So we\ntopic. Oh yeah that is perfect. So we\ntopic. Oh yeah that is perfect. So we have just invoked the graph with zero\nhave just invoked the graph with zero\nhave just invoked the graph with zero max iterations and topic is AI. Let's\nmax iterations and topic is AI. Let's\nmax iterations and topic is AI. Let's not pick AI. What is what joke we need\nnot pick AI. What is what joke we need\nnot pick AI. What is what joke we need to make on AI? Let's say on\nto make on AI? Let's say on\nto make on AI? Let's say on No, bro. No jokes on programming. Not at\nNo, bro. No jokes on programming. Not at\nNo, bro. No jokes on programming. Not at all. Let's say on cars. Okay. On cars.\nall. Let's say on cars. Okay. On cars.\nall. Let's say on cars. Okay. On cars. Let me just click on run all. Let's see\nLet me just click on run all. Let's see\nLet me just click on run all. Let's see what do we get.\nwhat do we get.\nwhat do we get. Uh let's see. Let's see. Let's see.\nUh let's see. Let's see. Let's see.\nUh let's see. Let's see. Let's see. And our joke will be updated. Okay,\nAnd our joke will be updated. Okay,\nAnd our joke will be updated. Okay, that's fine. Yeah,\nthat's fine. Yeah,\nthat's fine. Yeah, that's fine. Uh, let's see what do we\nthat's fine. Uh, let's see what do we\nthat's fine. Uh, let's see what do we get. So, bro, I just replaced my\nget. So, bro, I just replaced my\nget. So, bro, I just replaced my invocation function with this one\ninvocation function with this one\ninvocation function with this one because it was taking so much time\nbecause it was taking so much time\nbecause it was taking so much time because obviously it is taking time\nbecause obviously it is taking time\nbecause obviously it is taking time because of iteration. So, I wanted to\nbecause of iteration. So, I wanted to\nbecause of iteration. So, I wanted to see the data in real time. So, I can see\nsee the data in real time. So, I can see\nsee the data in real time. So, I can see it now. It is generating the data. See\nit now. It is generating the data. See\nit now. It is generating the data. See generate node and then this is the joke.\ngenerate node and then this is the joke.\ngenerate node and then this is the joke. Evaluate node is this joke and it has\nEvaluate node is this joke and it has\nEvaluate node is this joke and it has simply provided some critique. Okay, so\nsimply provided some critique. Okay, so\nsimply provided some critique. Okay, so funny flag is funny. Oh, if funny flag\nfunny flag is funny. Oh, if funny flag\nfunny flag is funny. Oh, if funny flag is funny, why it is just generating more\nis funny, why it is just generating more\nis funny, why it is just generating more jokes. Okay, we will just check it\njokes.

By the way, if if if it is saying funny, why it\nway, if if if it is saying funny, why it\nway, if if if it is saying funny, why it is just going to that node? Let me just\nis just going to that node? Let me just\nis just going to that node? Let me just check our logic. Let me just check our\ncheck our logic. Let me just check our\ncheck our logic. Let me just check our logic.\nlogic.\nlogic. So let me just go to my condition.\nSo let me just go to my condition.\nSo let me just go to my condition. Oh,\nOh,\nOh, makes sense because see we only need to\nmakes sense because see we only need to\nmakes sense because see we only need to go to the iteration like this evaluate\ngo to the iteration like this evaluate\ngo to the iteration like this evaluate node if the iteration is less than\nnode if the iteration is less than\nnode if the iteration is less than equals to 5 obviously and if the funny\nequals to 5 obviously and if the funny\nequals to 5 obviously and if the funny flag is not funny make sense only then\nflag is not funny make sense only then\nflag is not funny make sense only then we need to just go there otherwise end\nwe need to just go there otherwise end\nwe need to just go there otherwise end it. So I'll simply say less than equal\nit. So I'll simply say less than equal\nit. So I'll simply say less than equal to 5 amp%\nto 5 amp%\nto 5 amp% state flag is not equals to funny\nstate flag is not equals to funny\nstate flag is not equals to funny otherwise end it. Okay now makes sense.\notherwise end it. Okay now makes sense.\notherwise end it. Okay now makes sense. Now let's see the answer in the real\nNow let's see the answer in the real\nNow let's see the answer in the real time.\ntime.\ntime.

Why did car go to therapy? It had too many exhaust issues.\ntoo many exhaust issues.\ntoo many exhaust issues. So funny. So funny. Evaluate node. So\nSo funny. So funny. Evaluate node. So\nSo funny. So funny. Evaluate node. So what it has evaluated? Oh, so it has\nwhat it has evaluated? Oh, so it has\nwhat it has evaluated? Oh, so it has said like funny flag is funny. Okay,\nsaid like funny flag is funny. Okay,\nsaid like funny flag is funny. Okay, makes sense. Okay. And now generate node\nmakes sense. Okay. And now generate node\nmakes sense. Okay. And now generate node has generated this thing. My car is\nhas generated this thing. My car is\nhas generated this thing. My car is great comedy and it's always exhausting.\ngreat comedy and it's always exhausting.\ngreat comedy and it's always exhausting. And funny flag is funny. Okay, that\nAnd funny flag is funny. Okay, that\nAnd funny flag is funny. Okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. So now we\nmakes sense. That makes sense. So now we\nmakes sense. That makes sense. So now we have got the joke and the execution is\nhave got the joke and the execution is\nhave got the joke and the execution is completed with the critique. with the\ncompleted with the critique. with the\ncompleted with the critique. with the critique.\ncritique.\ncritique. That means that now you can simply\nThat means that now you can simply\nThat means that now you can simply generate the joke with the help of\ngenerate the joke with the help of\ngenerate the joke with the help of critique. Now you will say hey why it\ncritique. Now you will say hey why it\ncritique. Now you will say hey why it has just gone to generate node because\nhas just gone to generate node because\nhas just gone to generate node because it will obviously go to the generate\nit will obviously go to the generate\nit will obviously go to the generate node one time because of the because of\nnode one time because of the because of\nnode one time because of the because of this arrow. That makes sense because it\nthis arrow. That makes sense because it\nthis arrow. That makes sense because it cannot simply like go to end because of\ncannot simply like go to end because of\ncannot simply like go to end because of our edges. Simple. So obviously we need\nour edges. Simple. So obviously we need\nour edges. Simple. So obviously we need at least one at least one iteration of\nat least one at least one iteration of\nat least one at least one iteration of the of the joke. Okay. And then if it\nthe of the joke. Okay. And then if it\nthe of the joke. Okay. And then if it like surpassed the value five then it\nlike surpassed the value five then it\nlike surpassed the value five then it should not go to that one. Simple. So\nshould not go to that one. Simple. So\nshould not go to that one. Simple. So this way you can handle the infinite\nthis way you can handle the infinite\nthis way you can handle the infinite loop issues by just adding this max\nloop issues by just adding this max\nloop issues by just adding this max iterations key. Simple. Very very very\niterations key. Simple. Very very very\niterations key. Simple. Very very very well done. So now you have understood\nwell done. So now you have understood\nwell done. So now you have understood and mastered not understood mastered all\nand mastered not understood mastered all\nand mastered not understood mastered all of the architectures available in the\nof the architectures available in the\nof the architectures available in the langraph. All of the workflows react\nlangraph. All of the workflows react\nlangraph. All of the workflows react agent everything. See everything is\nagent everything. See everything is\nagent everything. See everything is covered. Now you are ready to build your\ncovered. Now you are ready to build your\ncovered. Now you are ready to build your langraph applications. But there's one\nlangraph applications. But there's one\nlangraph applications. But there's one more concept that I want to show you.\nmore concept that I want to show you.\nmore concept that I want to show you. It's called memory. And it's very\nIt's called memory. And it's very\nIt's called memory. And it's very important. So now let me just ask you a\nimportant. So now let me just ask you a\nimportant. So now let me just ask you a simple question. Whatever I am asking to\nsimple question. Whatever I am asking to\nsimple question. Whatever I am asking to this LLM, let's say I am this user,\nthis LLM, let's say I am this user,\nthis LLM, let's say I am this user, right? If I invoke this graph, okay,\nright? If I invoke this graph, okay,\nright? If I invoke this graph, okay, let's say let's let's take the example\nlet's say let's let's take the example\nlet's say let's let's take the example of very simple use case. So let's talk\nof very simple use case. So let's talk\nof very simple use case. So let's talk about the memory in langraph.\nSimple. I am this user\nSimple. I am this user and I am talking to this\nand I am talking to this\nand I am talking to this node.\nnode.\nnode. Okay. I am just talking to this node and\nOkay. I am just talking to this node and\nOkay. I am just talking to this node and this is just giving me the answers.\nthis is just giving me the answers.\nthis is just giving me the answers. Simple. Now when I just invoke this\nSimple. Now when I just invoke this\nSimple. Now when I just invoke this graph, it gives me the answer. But when\ngraph, it gives me the answer. But when\ngraph, it gives me the answer. But when I again invoke this graph, will it\nI again invoke this graph, will it\nI again invoke this graph, will it remember me? Obviously not. So now you\nremember me? Obviously not. So now you\nremember me? Obviously not. So now you will say obviously this is the expected\nwill say obviously this is the expected\nwill say obviously this is the expected behavior but I want this LLM to remember\nbehavior but I want this LLM to remember\nbehavior but I want this LLM to remember me. I want whenever I'm asking any\nme. I want whenever I'm asking any\nme. I want whenever I'm asking any question LLM should answer as per my\nquestion LLM should answer as per my\nquestion LLM should answer as per my previous chat as per my previous\nprevious chat as per my previous\nprevious chat as per my previous preferences.\npreferences.\npreferences. Then only I will get the desired answer\nThen only I will get the desired answer\nThen only I will get the desired answer every time whenever I'm just asking any\nevery time whenever I'm just asking any\nevery time whenever I'm just asking any question that's the behavior you see in\nquestion that's the behavior you see in\nquestion that's the behavior you see in chat GBD or any chatbot right?\nchat GBD or any chatbot right?\nchat GBD or any chatbot right? Make sense? So now let's see how we can\nMake sense? So now let's see how we can\nMake sense? So now let's see how we can just implement this solution in our\njust implement this solution in our\njust implement this solution in our code. Let's see. So now let's try to\ncode. Let's see. So now let's try to\ncode. Let's see. So now let's try to create our memory. And first of all just\ncreate our memory. And first of all just\ncreate our memory. And first of all just a good thing you can even create your\na good thing you can even create your\na good thing you can even create your own method to store the memory because\nown method to store the memory because\nown method to store the memory because it's all about creativity how you want\nit's all about creativity how you want\nit's all about creativity how you want to just store the memory. I am just\nto just store the memory. I am just\nto just store the memory. I am just showing you the way that is described in\nshowing you the way that is described in\nshowing you the way that is described in the langraph. Okay. So that you can just\nthe langraph. Okay. So that you can just\nthe langraph. Okay. So that you can just know one of the creative ways as well.\nknow one of the creative ways as well.\nknow one of the creative ways as well. So let's say memory\nSo let's say memory\nSo let's say memory because you can literally create let\nbecause you can literally create let\nbecause you can literally create let let's try to complete this code and then\nlet's try to complete this code and then\nlet's try to complete this code and then I will just show you what are the other\nI will just show you what are the other\nI will just show you what are the other ways that you can use. Okay simple. So\nways that you can use. Okay simple. So\nways that you can use. Okay simple. So let me just um which one did I copy? I\nlet me just um which one did I copy? I\nlet me just um which one did I copy? I don't need to copy this one because I\ndon't need to copy this one because I\ndon't need to copy this one because I just need to show you the basic graph\njust need to show you the basic graph\njust need to show you the basic graph because we here we are not like covering\nbecause we here we are not like covering\nbecause we here we are not like covering the complex graph. So let me just clone\nthe complex graph. So let me just clone\nthe complex graph. So let me just clone this one. Rename\nthis one. Rename\nthis one. Rename 11 and let's say memory. And if you will\n11 and let's say memory. And if you will\n11 and let's say memory. And if you will take my advice, I will always say that\ntake my advice, I will always say that\ntake my advice, I will always say that always build your own method to store\nalways build your own method to store\nalways build your own method to store the memory so that you do not face the\nthe memory so that you do not face the\nthe memory so that you do not face the problems like vendor lock in because\nproblems like vendor lock in because\nproblems like vendor lock in because storing memory is very very important.\nstoring memory is very very important.\nstoring memory is very very important. Okay. And I have faced those vendor\nOkay. And I have faced those vendor\nOkay. And I have faced those vendor lockins problem. That's why I'm just\nlockins problem. That's why I'm just\nlockins problem. That's why I'm just suggesting you but still I'm just\nsuggesting you but still I'm just\nsuggesting you but still I'm just showing you how you can just do it with\nshowing you how you can just do it with\nshowing you how you can just do it with the langraph. So first of all let's try\nthe langraph. So first of all let's try\nthe langraph. So first of all let's try to\nto\nto run this cell and let's try to create\nrun this cell and let's try to create\nrun this cell and let's try to create our LLM. So first step. So here I will\nour LLM. So first step. So here I will\nour LLM. So first step. So here I will also show you one more way and it is\nalso show you one more way and it is\nalso show you one more way and it is also important when you want to use the\nalso important when you want to use the\nalso important when you want to use the u built-in method of memory from lang\nu built-in method of memory from lang\nu built-in method of memory from lang graph. So here what we need to do we\ngraph. So here what we need to do we\ngraph. So here what we need to do we need to create the schema right so here\nneed to create the schema right so here\nneed to create the schema right so here we will create a very simple schema\nwe will create a very simple schema\nwe will create a very simple schema let's say class graph schema and here I\nlet's say class graph schema and here I\nlet's say class graph schema and here I will just create a keyword called\nwill just create a keyword called\nwill just create a keyword called messages and here I will pick the\nmessages and here I will pick the\nmessages and here I will pick the annotated\nannotated\nannotated simple of list\nsimple of list\nsimple of list and here instead of using add I have to\nand here instead of using add I have to\nand here instead of using add I have to use add messages which is a kind of\nuse add messages which is a kind of\nuse add messages which is a kind of another reducer similar to add messages\nanother reducer similar to add messages\nanother reducer similar to add messages is like kind of old way to do it but if\nis like kind of old way to do it but if\nis like kind of old way to do it but if you want to use threads, you have to use\nyou want to use threads, you have to use\nyou want to use threads, you have to use add messages. So I'll simply say from\nadd messages. So I'll simply say from\nadd messages. So I'll simply say from langraph dot graph dot message import\nlangraph dot graph dot message import\nlangraph dot graph dot message import add messages. Simple and let's import\nadd messages. Simple and let's import\nadd messages. Simple and let's import annotated as well. And what is this\nannotated as well. And what is this\nannotated as well. And what is this langraph dot message\nlangraph dot message\nlangraph dot message uh or messages or message? I think this\nuh or messages or message? I think this\nuh or messages or message? I think this is the one. Oh, I think one g is left.\nis the one. Oh, I think one g is left.\nis the one. Oh, I think one g is left. Okay, perfect. So add messages. And one\nOkay, perfect. So add messages. And one\nOkay, perfect. So add messages. And one more thing, you have to keep the keyword\nmore thing, you have to keep the keyword\nmore thing, you have to keep the keyword as messages. You cannot keep like\nas messages. You cannot keep like\nas messages. You cannot keep like message or whatever. Okay, it is not\nmessage or whatever. Okay, it is not\nmessage or whatever. Okay, it is not allowed. That is like a kind of problem\nallowed. That is like a kind of problem\nallowed. That is like a kind of problem when you use like built-in features just\nwhen you use like built-in features just\nwhen you use like built-in features just to store the memory as well because it\nto store the memory as well because it\nto store the memory as well because it will only create the um automated\nwill only create the um automated\nwill only create the um automated addition of memory or basically history\naddition of memory or basically history\naddition of memory or basically history to your chat when you will use this\nto your chat when you will use this\nto your chat when you will use this keyword messages. That's why I like my\nkeyword messages. That's why I like my\nkeyword messages. That's why I like my own way of doing it. Okay, but let's try\nown way of doing it. Okay, but let's try\nown way of doing it. Okay, but let's try to explore this one as well. Then I will\nto explore this one as well. Then I will\nto explore this one as well. Then I will just give you my suggestions. So\njust give you my suggestions. So\njust give you my suggestions. So perfect. Here we just need to get the\nperfect. Here we just need to get the\nperfect. Here we just need to get the message and perfect. And here let me\nmessage and perfect. And here let me\nmessage and perfect. And here let me just change it to messages and we do not\njust change it to messages and we do not\njust change it to messages and we do not have any kind of name. So that is fine.\nhave any kind of name. So that is fine.\nhave any kind of name. So that is fine. I can remove this as well. This as well.\nI can remove this as well. This as well.\nI can remove this as well. This as well. This as well. Perfect. So current\nThis as well. Perfect. So current\nThis as well. Perfect. So current message and here's my response. Okay,\nmessage and here's my response. Okay,\nmessage and here's my response. Okay, that looks good. And this is our graph.\nthat looks good. And this is our graph.\nthat looks good. And this is our graph. So yeah, now now is the thing. Now you\nSo yeah, now now is the thing. Now you\nSo yeah, now now is the thing. Now you need to compile the graph in with just\nneed to compile the graph in with just\nneed to compile the graph in with just one tweak. Here you will compile the\none tweak. Here you will compile the\none tweak. Here you will compile the graph with something called as\ngraph with something called as\ngraph with something called as checkpoint\ncheckpoint\ncheckpoint because you want to create the\nbecause you want to create the\nbecause you want to create the checkpoint for your chat right whatever\ncheckpoint for your chat right whatever\ncheckpoint for your chat right whatever your last chat was. So I will compile\nyour last chat was. So I will compile\nyour last chat was. So I will compile the graph using checkpoint. So here what\nthe graph using checkpoint. So here what\nthe graph using checkpoint. So here what I need to do I will simply import from\nI need to do I will simply import from\nI need to do I will simply import from langraph\nlangraph\nlangraph dot graph. Let me just check the class\ndot graph. Let me just check the class\ndot graph. Let me just check the class in the official documentation.\nin the official documentation.\nin the official documentation. Uh\nUh\nUh where is the where is the class? So\nwhere is the where is the class? So\nwhere is the where is the class? So where's the class name? Uh the class\nwhere's the class name? Uh the class\nwhere's the class name? Uh the class name is this one langchain.point domey.\nname is this one langchain.point domey.\nname is this one langchain.point domey. Perfect.\nPerfect.\nPerfect. Perfect. So here I have imported this\nPerfect. So here I have imported this\nPerfect. So here I have imported this particular object called in-memory\nparticular object called in-memory\nparticular object called in-memory saver. So this is a kind of object that\nsaver. So this is a kind of object that\nsaver. So this is a kind of object that we use to create the checkpoint. So I\nwe use to create the checkpoint. So I\nwe use to create the checkpoint. So I will say checkpoint equals to inmemory\nwill say checkpoint equals to inmemory\nwill say checkpoint equals to inmemory saver. Perfect. Now while you can say\nsaver. Perfect. Now while you can say\nsaver. Perfect. Now while you can say compiling your graph. While compiling\ncompiling your graph. While compiling\ncompiling your graph. While compiling your graph you have to pass this\nyour graph you have to pass this\nyour graph you have to pass this checkpoint. You will simply say\ncheckpoint. You will simply say\ncheckpoint. You will simply say checkpoint equals to checkpoint. Simple.\ncheckpoint equals to checkpoint. Simple.\ncheckpoint equals to checkpoint. Simple. So now what will happen? Whenever you\nSo now what will happen? Whenever you\nSo now what will happen? Whenever you will be just invoking this graph, it\nwill be just invoking this graph, it\nwill be just invoking this graph, it will not be invoked normally. It will be\nwill not be invoked normally. It will be\nwill not be invoked normally. It will be now invoked using the checkpoints.\nnow invoked using the checkpoints.\nnow invoked using the checkpoints. Make sense? Very good. Now we also need\nMake sense? Very good. Now we also need\nMake sense? Very good. Now we also need to make sure that each user can access\nto make sure that each user can access\nto make sure that each user can access their chat and it should not have any\ntheir chat and it should not have any\ntheir chat and it should not have any kind of reference between the chats.\nkind of reference between the chats.\nkind of reference between the chats. Obviously for that we will invoke our\nObviously for that we will invoke our\nObviously for that we will invoke our graph with a different method. Okay,\ngraph with a different method. Okay,\ngraph with a different method. Okay, what is a method? Let me just show you.\nwhat is a method? Let me just show you.\nwhat is a method? Let me just show you. So instead of writing the graph like\nSo instead of writing the graph like\nSo instead of writing the graph like this, so we have to run the graph with\nthis, so we have to run the graph with\nthis, so we have to run the graph with config variables or you can say with\nconfig variables or you can say with\nconfig variables or you can say with config. Simple. So first of all, let me\nconfig. Simple. So first of all, let me\nconfig. Simple. So first of all, let me just import the config. So you can\njust import the config. So you can\njust import the config. So you can import the config like let's say from\nimport the config like let's say from\nimport the config like let's say from actually you don't need to import the\nactually you don't need to import the\nactually you don't need to import the config. You can directly run it as well.\nconfig. You can directly run it as well.\nconfig. You can directly run it as well. Let's see. So I will say\nLet's see. So I will say\nLet's see. So I will say memory graph dot invoke and my messages\nmemory graph dot invoke and my messages\nmemory graph dot invoke and my messages will be let's say\num I will say my name is an okay\num I will say my name is an okay simple and after passing this I have to\nsimple and after passing this I have to\nsimple and after passing this I have to pass the configuration so I will simply\npass the configuration so I will simply\npass the configuration so I will simply say configurable\nsay configurable\nsay configurable configurable\nconfigurable\nconfigurable and Then the configurable will be let's\nand Then the configurable will be let's\nand Then the configurable will be let's say\nsay\nsay um what should we say thread id yeah\nthread ID equals to thread one or let's\nthread ID equals to thread one or let's say my name let's say an this is me this\nsay my name let's say an this is me this\nsay my name let's say an this is me this is my identifier okay my thread ID means\nis my identifier okay my thread ID means\nis my identifier okay my thread ID means my identifier like okay this is me I am\nmy identifier like okay this is me I am\nmy identifier like okay this is me I am chatting with you simple simple simple\nchatting with you simple simple simple\nchatting with you simple simple simple simple so just make sure you use all of\nsimple so just make sure you use all of\nsimple so just make sure you use all of these things simple so now let's try to\nthese things simple so now let's try to\nthese things simple so now let's try to run this thing and we need to run all\nrun this thing and we need to run all\nrun this thing and we need to run all because we didn't run anything.\nbecause we didn't run anything.\nbecause we didn't run anything. So now what this will do this will\nSo now what this will do this will\nSo now what this will do this will invoke the graph first of all and you\ninvoke the graph first of all and you\ninvoke the graph first of all and you will see the graph here and now it will\nwill see the graph here and now it will\nwill see the graph here and now it will invoke the graph with this query for\ninvoke the graph with this query for\ninvoke the graph with this query for sure but it will also pass this\nsure but it will also pass this\nsure but it will also pass this configuration along with the query. So\nconfiguration along with the query. So\nconfiguration along with the query. So you have got the response and it is\nyou have got the response and it is\nyou have got the response and it is saying my name is an\nsaying my name is an\nsaying my name is an wow we have just got human message.\nwow we have just got human message.\nwow we have just got human message. Where's the AI message? That's the\nWhere's the AI message? That's the\nWhere's the AI message? That's the thing. Human message, my name is An.\nthing. Human message, my name is An.\nthing. Human message, my name is An. Okay, that makes sense. But where is our\nOkay, that makes sense. But where is our\nOkay, that makes sense. But where is our messages? Let me just see if we are\nmessages? Let me just see if we are\nmessages? Let me just see if we are adding anything or not. Um, your current\nadding anything or not. Um, your current\nadding anything or not. Um, your current message was this. And oh, we have to\nmessage was this. And oh, we have to\nmessage was this. And oh, we have to change the messages because this is now\nchange the messages because this is now\nchange the messages because this is now messages. Okay, let me just say run all.\nmessages. Okay, let me just say run all.\nmessages. Okay, let me just say run all. And now let's see what do we have.\nperfect. So it is saying your content\nperfect. So it is saying your content was human message and here's my\nwas human message and here's my\nwas human message and here's my response. Nice to meet you. How can I\nresponse. Nice to meet you. How can I\nresponse. Nice to meet you. How can I help you today? Now now now\nhelp you today? Now now now\nhelp you today? Now now now if I if I try to ask the question like\nif I if I try to ask the question like\nif I if I try to ask the question like what is my name?\nwhat is my name?\nwhat is my name? Let's see what it responds. Let's see.\nLet's see what it responds. Let's see.\nLet's see what it responds. Let's see. Okay. And it is saying\nOkay. And it is saying\nOkay. And it is saying your message was this my name is an and\nyour message was this my name is an and\nyour message was this my name is an and nice to meet you an how can you help you\nnice to meet you an how can you help you\nnice to meet you an how can you help you how can I help you today so my name is\nhow can I help you today so my name is\nhow can I help you today so my name is an human message I can simply get the\nan human message I can simply get the\nan human message I can simply get the latest message as well but that's fine\nlatest message as well but that's fine\nlatest message as well but that's fine so now I want to just show you what\nso now I want to just show you what\nso now I want to just show you what actually is happening so if I go to\nactually is happening so if I go to\nactually is happening so if I go to response let's say response\nresponse let's say response\nresponse let's say response okay because we just need to fetch the\nokay because we just need to fetch the\nokay because we just need to fetch the response of\nresponse of\nresponse of content basically or let's say response\ncontent basically or let's say response\ncontent basically or let's say response of minus one dot content let's see so\nof minus one dot content let's see so\nof minus one dot content let's see so I'm again asking the same question what\nI'm again asking the same question what\nI'm again asking the same question what is my name uh response of minus one\nis my name uh response of minus one\nis my name uh response of minus one let's say response dot content\ndictionary object has no oh because\ndictionary object has no oh because response is a um you can say\nresponse is a um you can say\nresponse is a um you can say a kind of list and within the list I can\na kind of list and within the list I can\na kind of list and within the list I can access minus one now let's\nOkay. So it is saying your message was\nOkay. So it is saying your message was my name is an okay and here is my\nmy name is an okay and here is my\nmy name is an okay and here is my response. It will say\nresponse. It will say\nresponse. It will say your message was my name is an\nyour message was my name is an\nyour message was my name is an and nice to meet you. How can I help you\nand nice to meet you. How can I help you\nand nice to meet you. How can I help you today? Here are few things and let me\ntoday? Here are few things and let me\ntoday? Here are few things and let me just make it like beauty like let me\njust make it like beauty like let me\njust make it like beauty like let me just beautify this because whenever you\njust beautify this because whenever you\njust beautify this because whenever you just work with this kind of things we\njust work with this kind of things we\njust work with this kind of things we have to just use something called as\nhave to just use something called as\nhave to just use something called as pretty print because then only you can\npretty print because then only you can\npretty print because then only you can see like what was the um you can say\nsee like what was the um you can say\nsee like what was the um you can say answer because it will like keep on\nanswer because it will like keep on\nanswer because it will like keep on adding keep on adding keep on adding\nadding keep on adding keep on adding\nadding keep on adding keep on adding stuff and let me just show you first of\nstuff and let me just show you first of\nstuff and let me just show you first of all with a new thread id so let's say I\nall with a new thread id so let's say I\nall with a new thread id so let's say I am an lamba now I am a new person so I'm\nam an lamba now I am a new person so I'm\nam an lamba now I am a new person so I'm just sending a new request let's say my\njust sending a new request let's say my\njust sending a new request let's say my name is an okay let's try to invoke it.\nname is an okay let's try to invoke it.\nname is an okay let's try to invoke it. And now let me just bring the pretty\nAnd now let me just bring the pretty\nAnd now let me just bring the pretty print code. So what we can do we can\nprint code. So what we can do we can\nprint code. So what we can do we can have like messages. So I will simply say\nhave like messages. So I will simply say\nhave like messages. So I will simply say for message in response of messages and\nfor message in response of messages and\nfor message in response of messages and then\nthen\nthen message dot\nmessage dot\nmessage dot pretty simple now let's try to run this\npretty simple now let's try to run this\npretty simple now let's try to run this pretty print because I want to just see\npretty print because I want to just see\npretty print because I want to just see the you can say message in the nice\nthe you can say message in the nice\nthe you can say message in the nice format. Okay. Now it is saying human\nformat. Okay. Now it is saying human\nformat. Okay. Now it is saying human message human message your name your\nmessage human message your name your\nmessage human message your name your message was this and now it is like why\nmessage was this and now it is like why\nmessage was this and now it is like why it is writing human message here because\nit is writing human message here because\nit is writing human message here because this is an AI message right so it is\nthis is an AI message right so it is\nthis is an AI message right so it is saying that is not a problem okay\nsaying that is not a problem okay\nsaying that is not a problem okay because this is the main thing that we\nbecause this is the main thing that we\nbecause this is the main thing that we want your message was this one my name\nwant your message was this one my name\nwant your message was this one my name is an and here's my response nice to\nis an and here's my response nice to\nis an and here's my response nice to meet you so this was like very first\nmeet you so this was like very first\nmeet you so this was like very first message simple this is like very first\nmessage simple this is like very first\nmessage simple this is like very first message now what I need to do I need to\nmessage now what I need to do I need to\nmessage now what I need to do I need to simply ask the Second question I will\nsimply ask the Second question I will\nsimply ask the Second question I will simply say uh what is my name and it\nsimply say uh what is my name and it\nsimply say uh what is my name and it should remember me okay as per the\nshould remember me okay as per the\nshould remember me okay as per the memory. Let's try to run this thing and\nmemory. Let's try to run this thing and\nmemory. Let's try to run this thing and let's see what do we get.\nlet's see what do we get.\nlet's see what do we get. Okay so it is saying my name is an your\nOkay so it is saying my name is an your\nOkay so it is saying my name is an your message was this. This is a previous\nmessage was this. This is a previous\nmessage was this. This is a previous message. This is a new message. My what\nmessage. This is a new message. My what\nmessage. This is a new message. My what is my name? So now it is saying your\nis my name? So now it is saying your\nis my name? So now it is saying your message was this. This is the kind of\nmessage was this. This is the kind of\nmessage was this. This is the kind of history that it is just telling me.\nhistory that it is just telling me.\nhistory that it is just telling me. Okay. So now it is responding me this\nOkay. So now it is responding me this\nOkay. So now it is responding me this thing. your message was this and it is\nthing. your message was this and it is\nthing. your message was this and it is generating your message was this again\ngenerating your message was this again\ngenerating your message was this again because it is like keep on appending the\nbecause it is like keep on appending the\nbecause it is like keep on appending the things and it is saying nice to meet you\nthings and it is saying nice to meet you\nthings and it is saying nice to meet you an examples blah blah blah I just want\nan examples blah blah blah I just want\nan examples blah blah blah I just want to see the latest message here's my\nto see the latest message here's my\nto see the latest message here's my response your name is an it is like\nresponse your name is an it is like\nresponse your name is an it is like embedded\nembedded\nembedded uh you can say hierarchically but I know\nuh you can say hierarchically but I know\nuh you can say hierarchically but I know how to find it so here is a response it\nhow to find it so here is a response it\nhow to find it so here is a response it is saying your name is an\nis saying your name is an\nis saying your name is an so now it remembers me why because I go\nso now it remembers me why because I go\nso now it remembers me why because I go to LLM with my identity card which is\nto LLM with my identity card which is\nto LLM with my identity card which is this one configurable.\nthis one configurable.\nthis one configurable. Now it remembers me. But if I go to LLM\nNow it remembers me. But if I go to LLM\nNow it remembers me. But if I go to LLM with any other name let's say XYZ. Okay.\nwith any other name let's say XYZ. Okay.\nwith any other name let's say XYZ. Okay. And if I ask the same question it will\nAnd if I ask the same question it will\nAnd if I ask the same question it will not say your name is Anal Lamba. Let me\nnot say your name is Anal Lamba. Let me\nnot say your name is Anal Lamba. Let me show you. It will simply say I don't\nshow you. It will simply say I don't\nshow you. It will simply say I don't know you because this is a different ID\nknow you because this is a different ID\nknow you because this is a different ID card. See what is my name and this is\ncard. See what is my name and this is\ncard. See what is my name and this is the your message was this thing and\nthe your message was this thing and\nthe your message was this thing and here's the response. Let me slide. I\nhere's the response. Let me slide. I\nhere's the response. Let me slide. I don't know your name yet. See because\ndon't know your name yet. See because\ndon't know your name yet. See because now this person is new. This person is\nnow this person is new. This person is\nnow this person is new. This person is new. And when I ask the question as my\nnew. And when I ask the question as my\nnew. And when I ask the question as my ID called An Lamba, it knows me. It\nID called An Lamba, it knows me. It\nID called An Lamba, it knows me. It knows me. But with a different ID, it\nknows me. But with a different ID, it\nknows me. But with a different ID, it doesn't know anything. That is the\ndoesn't know anything. That is the\ndoesn't know anything. That is the concept of memory. And now let me share\nconcept of memory. And now let me share\nconcept of memory. And now let me share my insights like how you can just take\nmy insights like how you can just take\nmy insights like how you can just take care of memories in Langraph or in you\ncare of memories in Langraph or in you\ncare of memories in Langraph or in you can say in the real world. First of all,\ncan say in the real world. First of all,\ncan say in the real world. First of all, you should never dependent uh on this\nyou should never dependent uh on this\nyou should never dependent uh on this particular method called inmemory saver\nparticular method called inmemory saver\nparticular method called inmemory saver and all. You should always create your\nand all. You should always create your\nand all. You should always create your own method to how you can just store the\nown method to how you can just store the\nown method to how you can just store the memory. For example, you can just write\nmemory. For example, you can just write\nmemory. For example, you can just write the data in the disk. You can create a\nthe data in the disk. You can create a\nthe data in the disk. You can create a txt file. Okay, you can just store the\ntxt file. Okay, you can just store the\ntxt file. Okay, you can just store the um ID and then the entire chat history\num ID and then the entire chat history\num ID and then the entire chat history using simple list um comprehension. This\nusing simple list um comprehension. This\nusing simple list um comprehension. This is one way. Second way, you can also\nis one way. Second way, you can also\nis one way. Second way, you can also explore Postgrace. You can create your\nexplore Postgrace. You can create your\nexplore Postgrace. You can create your Postgrid database and you can just write\nPostgrid database and you can just write\nPostgrid database and you can just write the data into the Postgress database.\nthe data into the Postgress database.\nthe data into the Postgress database. This is just for the prototyping. Okay,\nThis is just for the prototyping. Okay,\nThis is just for the prototyping. Okay, this in memory saver but it is good to\nthis in memory saver but it is good to\nthis in memory saver but it is good to understand the concept first of all,\nunderstand the concept first of all,\nunderstand the concept first of all, right? So this is my guidance and you\nright? So this is my guidance and you\nright? So this is my guidance and you can just take it because when you will\ncan just take it because when you will\ncan just take it because when you will be just creating your own method, you\nbe just creating your own method, you\nbe just creating your own method, you have like full freedom. You do not need\nhave like full freedom. You do not need\nhave like full freedom. You do not need to just use the same keyword. You do not\nto just use the same keyword. You do not\nto just use the same keyword. You do not need to just use ad messages or whatever\nneed to just use ad messages or whatever\nneed to just use ad messages or whatever because you will handle everything. And\nbecause you will handle everything. And\nbecause you will handle everything. And when you handle everything, you have to\nwhen you handle everything, you have to\nwhen you handle everything, you have to just put extra efforts. If you want to\njust put extra efforts. If you want to\njust put extra efforts. If you want to use the vendor features then obviously\nuse the vendor features then obviously\nuse the vendor features then obviously you need to just cooperate with the uh\nyou need to just cooperate with the uh\nyou need to just cooperate with the uh prerequest and all right so it's your\nprerequest and all right so it's your\nprerequest and all right so it's your choice if you just want to do a quick\nchoice if you just want to do a quick\nchoice if you just want to do a quick prototyping you can just um use this one\nprototyping you can just um use this one\nprototyping you can just um use this one if you want to build your own thing you\nif you want to build your own thing you\nif you want to build your own thing you can just use any method okay this is all\ncan just use any method okay this is all\ncan just use any method okay this is all about the memory in langraph now let's\nabout the memory in langraph now let's\nabout the memory in langraph now let's talk about a very important concept\ntalk about a very important concept\ntalk about a very important concept called human in loop because whenever we\ncalled human in loop because whenever we\ncalled human in loop because whenever we just build the agentic frameworks or\njust build the agentic frameworks or\njust build the agentic frameworks or basically agentic solutions using agenti\nbasically agentic solutions using agenti\nbasically agentic solutions using agenti frame aentic framework works. We have to\nframe aentic framework works. We have to\nframe aentic framework works. We have to involve this concept called human in the\ninvolve this concept called human in the\ninvolve this concept called human in the loop. Not every time but sometimes yes.\nloop. Not every time but sometimes yes.\nloop. Not every time but sometimes yes. Maybe you are doing something critical\nMaybe you are doing something critical\nMaybe you are doing something critical and you cannot let your agent framework\nand you cannot let your agent framework\nand you cannot let your agent framework to complete everything without your\nto complete everything without your\nto complete everything without your permission. So if that is the scenario\npermission. So if that is the scenario\npermission. So if that is the scenario then you have to involve this concept\nthen you have to involve this concept\nthen you have to involve this concept called human in the loop. Simple. So now\ncalled human in the loop. Simple. So now\ncalled human in the loop. Simple. So now if I just try to explain this concept.\nif I just try to explain this concept.\nif I just try to explain this concept. This is very simple. Let's say this is\nThis is very simple. Let's say this is\nThis is very simple. Let's say this is the same scenario here. So this is a\nthe same scenario here. So this is a\nthe same scenario here. So this is a task that this user wants LLM to do.\ntask that this user wants LLM to do.\ntask that this user wants LLM to do. Okay. But this task can be or let's say\nOkay. But this task can be or let's say\nOkay. But this task can be or let's say let's remove the query.\nlet's remove the query.\nlet's remove the query. Now this task can be performed and\nNow this task can be performed and\nNow this task can be performed and cannot be performed. So let's say\ncannot be performed. So let's say\ncannot be performed. So let's say there's a task for um doing something.\nthere's a task for um doing something.\nthere's a task for um doing something. Let's say anything. Let's say sending an\nLet's say anything. Let's say sending an\nLet's say anything. Let's say sending an email. Sending an email to director.\nemail. Sending an email to director.\nemail. Sending an email to director. Obviously this is a risky thing right\nObviously this is a risky thing right\nObviously this is a risky thing right you cannot just send the email directly\nyou cannot just send the email directly\nyou cannot just send the email directly to director without confirming without\nto director without confirming without\nto director without confirming without rereading it or whatever right so this\nrereading it or whatever right so this\nrereading it or whatever right so this is a task but do you know what you have\nis a task but do you know what you have\nis a task but do you know what you have to create the workflow to let's say send\nto create the workflow to let's say send\nto create the workflow to let's say send the summary of the day to the director\nthe summary of the day to the director\nthe summary of the day to the director and this is a very simple example by the\nand this is a very simple example by the\nand this is a very simple example by the way just to explain the stuff so let's\nway just to explain the stuff so let's\nway just to explain the stuff so let's say you want to just send an email to\nsay you want to just send an email to\nsay you want to just send an email to your director and you want to summarize\nyour director and you want to summarize\nyour director and you want to summarize the entire day that you have done so far\nthe entire day that you have done so far\nthe entire day that you have done so far and blah blah blah so maybe you were\nand blah blah blah so maybe you were\nand blah blah blah so maybe you were just writing all of the tasks in a sheet\njust writing all of the tasks in a sheet\njust writing all of the tasks in a sheet in a CSV and then you created a workflow\nin a CSV and then you created a workflow\nin a CSV and then you created a workflow where LLM is just summarizing\nwhere LLM is just summarizing\nwhere LLM is just summarizing everything. Now you want to create a\neverything. Now you want to create a\neverything. Now you want to create a workflow to send that email to director\nworkflow to send that email to director\nworkflow to send that email to director on a daily basis. But before sending you\non a daily basis. But before sending you\non a daily basis. But before sending you just want to confirm like the thing that\njust want to confirm like the thing that\njust want to confirm like the thing that is generated by AI is fine. What you\nis generated by AI is fine. What you\nis generated by AI is fine. What you will do instead of directly sending this\nwill do instead of directly sending this\nwill do instead of directly sending this thing to director you will involve human\nthing to director you will involve human\nthing to director you will involve human in the loop. So you will add one\nin the loop. So you will add one\nin the loop. So you will add one guardrail here simple like this.\nguardrail here simple like this.\nguardrail here simple like this. And this will be called as approval\nAnd this will be called as approval\nAnd this will be called as approval node.\nnode.\nnode. So in this node it will ask you to\nSo in this node it will ask you to\nSo in this node it will ask you to provide the approval. So here this user\nprovide the approval. So here this user\nprovide the approval. So here this user okay this user will be approving this\nokay this user will be approving this\nokay this user will be approving this thing again after triggering the\nthing again after triggering the\nthing again after triggering the workflow. Obviously maybe this tri this\nworkflow. Obviously maybe this tri this\nworkflow. Obviously maybe this tri this workflow is being triggered manually or\nworkflow is being triggered manually or\nworkflow is being triggered manually or maybe the person is using someuling\nmaybe the person is using someuling\nmaybe the person is using someuling frameworks let's say airflow or\nframeworks let's say airflow or\nframeworks let's say airflow or anything. So let's say this was\nanything. So let's say this was\nanything. So let's say this was scheduled on a daily basis. Now this\nscheduled on a daily basis. Now this\nscheduled on a daily basis. Now this person requires to approve again. Okay,\nperson requires to approve again. Okay,\nperson requires to approve again. Okay, this person is required to approve this\nthis person is required to approve this\nthis person is required to approve this particular framework again. So before\nparticular framework again. So before\nparticular framework again. So before sending this thing to your director,\nsending this thing to your director,\nsending this thing to your director, right? Before sending this thing to your\nright? Before sending this thing to your\nright? Before sending this thing to your director, you need to first get the\ndirector, you need to first get the\ndirector, you need to first get the approval. If you approve it, then only\napproval. If you approve it, then only\napproval. If you approve it, then only it will send it. Otherwise it will let's\nit will send it. Otherwise it will let's\nit will send it. Otherwise it will let's say keep it in draft or whatever so that\nsay keep it in draft or whatever so that\nsay keep it in draft or whatever so that you can just iterate it later on if you\nyou can just iterate it later on if you\nyou can just iterate it later on if you do not have some time anything.\ndo not have some time anything.\ndo not have some time anything. Okay but on the basis of your answer.\nOkay but on the basis of your answer.\nOkay but on the basis of your answer. Make sense? On the basis of your answer.\nMake sense? On the basis of your answer.\nMake sense? On the basis of your answer. Okay. Simple simple.\nOkay. Simple simple.\nOkay. Simple simple. Perfect. So this is the scenario. So\nPerfect. So this is the scenario. So\nPerfect. So this is the scenario. So when you involve this kind of um element\nwhen you involve this kind of um element\nwhen you involve this kind of um element in your architecture it becomes human in\nin your architecture it becomes human in\nin your architecture it becomes human in the loop. And to demonstrate this with\nthe loop. And to demonstrate this with\nthe loop. And to demonstrate this with the help of the code example, I would\nthe help of the code example, I would\nthe help of the code example, I would definitely recommend this official\ndefinitely recommend this official\ndefinitely recommend this official documentation for this thing because\ndocumentation for this thing because\ndocumentation for this thing because they have actually demonstrated this\nthey have actually demonstrated this\nthey have actually demonstrated this thing with the very good example. So\nthing with the very good example. So\nthing with the very good example. So just go to langraph and don't worry, I\njust go to langraph and don't worry, I\njust go to langraph and don't worry, I will just provide you the provide you\nwill just provide you the provide you\nwill just provide you the provide you this code in my VS code editor as well.\nthis code in my VS code editor as well.\nthis code in my VS code editor as well. So do not worry at all. So this is the\nSo do not worry at all. So this is the\nSo do not worry at all. So this is the official documentation and if you just\nofficial documentation and if you just\nofficial documentation and if you just go to interrupts in Langraph and if you\ngo to interrupts in Langraph and if you\ngo to interrupts in Langraph and if you just scroll down, you will see the full\njust scroll down, you will see the full\njust scroll down, you will see the full example. So here what they are just\nexample. So here what they are just\nexample. So here what they are just trying to do, let me just explain this\ntrying to do, let me just explain this\ntrying to do, let me just explain this thing here. So first of all they have\nthing here. So first of all they have\nthing here. So first of all they have created this approval node. Okay. And\ncreated this approval node. Okay. And\ncreated this approval node. Okay. And this approval node will have either\nthis approval node will have either\nthis approval node will have either proceed or cancel. Proceed or cancel.\nproceed or cancel. Proceed or cancel.\nproceed or cancel. Proceed or cancel. Okay. So this is like on the right hand\nOkay. So this is like on the right hand\nOkay. So this is like on the right hand side. So so it will only generate two\nside. So so it will only generate two\nside. So so it will only generate two things proceed or cancel. Simple. And\nthings proceed or cancel. Simple. And\nthings proceed or cancel. Simple. And the question will be do you want to\nthe question will be do you want to\nthe question will be do you want to approve this action? Yes. If yes then\napprove this action? Yes. If yes then\napprove this action? Yes. If yes then obviously you will also see the details\nobviously you will also see the details\nobviously you will also see the details like hey just show me the details like\nlike hey just show me the details like\nlike hey just show me the details like what you are just trying to do. So you\nwhat you are just trying to do. So you\nwhat you are just trying to do. So you will see the details some details. Let's\nwill see the details some details. Let's\nwill see the details some details. Let's say this is your email. This is a list\nsay this is your email. This is a list\nsay this is your email. This is a list of tasks that you have done and blah\nof tasks that you have done and blah\nof tasks that you have done and blah blah blah. And then we are using a route\nblah blah. And then we are using a route\nblah blah. And then we are using a route and this is a called you can say a kind\nand this is a called you can say a kind\nand this is a called you can say a kind of built-in function called command\nof built-in function called command\nof built-in function called command where we can simply route our workflow\nwhere we can simply route our workflow\nwhere we can simply route our workflow towards let's say proceed node and\ntowards let's say proceed node and\ntowards let's say proceed node and cancel node. Now you will say hey where\ncancel node. Now you will say hey where\ncancel node. Now you will say hey where are these two nodes? Hold on here are\nare these two nodes? Hold on here are\nare these two nodes? Hold on here are these two nodes. So if we have proceed\nthese two nodes. So if we have proceed\nthese two nodes. So if we have proceed nodes then you will simply say status\nnodes then you will simply say status\nnodes then you will simply say status equals to approved. We will simply\nequals to approved. We will simply\nequals to approved. We will simply change the status. Simple. And if it is\nchange the status. Simple. And if it is\nchange the status. Simple. And if it is like cancel node we will simply say\nlike cancel node we will simply say\nlike cancel node we will simply say rejected. Simple. And then we are simply\nrejected. Simple. And then we are simply\nrejected. Simple. And then we are simply building the graph using add node, add\nbuilding the graph using add node, add\nbuilding the graph using add node, add edge and whatever. Simple. Very good. So\nedge and whatever. Simple. Very good. So\nedge and whatever. Simple. Very good. So far this is very simple. Now let's talk\nfar this is very simple. Now let's talk\nfar this is very simple. Now let's talk about the critical part. Now we have to\nabout the critical part. Now we have to\nabout the critical part. Now we have to use something called as checkpoint for\nuse something called as checkpoint for\nuse something called as checkpoint for this because lang graph needs to make\nthis because lang graph needs to make\nthis because lang graph needs to make sure that it can save your chat in the\nsure that it can save your chat in the\nsure that it can save your chat in the memory or in postgr whatever so that it\nmemory or in postgr whatever so that it\nmemory or in postgr whatever so that it can just make the use of checkpoints to\ncan just make the use of checkpoints to\ncan just make the use of checkpoints to provide that particular context because\nprovide that particular context because\nprovide that particular context because what will happen whenever you will be\nwhat will happen whenever you will be\nwhat will happen whenever you will be just prompted to provide your answer\njust prompted to provide your answer\njust prompted to provide your answer that hey do you approve it or do you\nthat hey do you approve it or do you\nthat hey do you approve it or do you reject it you still need to reinvoke the\nreject it you still need to reinvoke the\nreject it you still need to reinvoke the graph indirectly Right? Because let's\ngraph indirectly Right? Because let's\ngraph indirectly Right? Because let's say the graph executed then it is asking\nsay the graph executed then it is asking\nsay the graph executed then it is asking you hey do you want to approve it or\nyou hey do you want to approve it or\nyou hey do you want to approve it or reject it. If you say approve it then\nreject it. If you say approve it then\nreject it. If you say approve it then yes you will be just um you can say\nyes you will be just um you can say\nyes you will be just um you can say reinvoking the graph. So checkpointer\nreinvoking the graph. So checkpointer\nreinvoking the graph. So checkpointer what checkpointer will do? Checkpointer\nwhat checkpointer will do? Checkpointer\nwhat checkpointer will do? Checkpointer will only trigger the graph from the\nwill only trigger the graph from the\nwill only trigger the graph from the state it was posed.\nstate it was posed.\nstate it was posed. Make sense? It will not just run the\nMake sense? It will not just run the\nMake sense? It will not just run the entire graph from the scratch. It will\nentire graph from the scratch. It will\nentire graph from the scratch. It will just run the graph from the state it was\njust run the graph from the state it was\njust run the graph from the state it was paused.\npaused.\npaused. Right? That is why we have to use a\nRight? That is why we have to use a\nRight? That is why we have to use a checkpointer here. And again, you know\ncheckpointer here. And again, you know\ncheckpointer here. And again, you know how to use a checkpointer using the\nhow to use a checkpointer using the\nhow to use a checkpointer using the config. And that's it. That's it. And\nconfig. And that's it. That's it. And\nconfig. And that's it. That's it. And this is the action details like what you\nthis is the action details like what you\nthis is the action details like what you are just trying to send.\nare just trying to send.\nare just trying to send. Maybe here they are just using the\nMaybe here they are just using the\nMaybe here they are just using the example where you are just trying to\nexample where you are just trying to\nexample where you are just trying to transfer some money. But we can just\ntransfer some money. But we can just\ntransfer some money. But we can just change it. Let's say daily logs um daily\nchange it. Let's say daily logs um daily\nchange it. Let's say daily logs um daily activities or whatever. Simple. Okay.\nactivities or whatever. Simple. Okay.\nactivities or whatever. Simple. Okay. Very good. So let's try to um apply this\nVery good. So let's try to um apply this\nVery good. So let's try to um apply this thing in our VS code. Then you will\nthing in our VS code. Then you will\nthing in our VS code. Then you will understand it. And by the way, it's very\nunderstand it. And by the way, it's very\nunderstand it. And by the way, it's very simple because if you understood this\nsimple because if you understood this\nsimple because if you understood this part, then implementation is very very\npart, then implementation is very very\npart, then implementation is very very easy. It's not a rocket science. It's\neasy. It's not a rocket science. It's\neasy. It's not a rocket science. It's just like using their built-in functions\njust like using their built-in functions\njust like using their built-in functions and that's it. That's it. It's not\nand that's it. That's it. It's not\nand that's it. That's it. It's not something like you are building the\nsomething like you are building the\nsomething like you are building the concept on the fly in your notebook. No,\nconcept on the fly in your notebook. No,\nconcept on the fly in your notebook. No, you are building the concepts here on\nyou are building the concepts here on\nyou are building the concepts here on the fly because it it's it was up to you\nthe fly because it it's it was up to you\nthe fly because it it's it was up to you how you want to build your workflow. But\nhow you want to build your workflow. But\nhow you want to build your workflow. But here you are not building any concept.\nhere you are not building any concept.\nhere you are not building any concept. You're simply using the built-in\nYou're simply using the built-in\nYou're simply using the built-in functions. That's it. Okay. Okay. So let\nfunctions. That's it. Okay. Okay. So let\nfunctions. That's it. Okay. Okay. So let me just create our last notebook of the\nme just create our last notebook of the\nme just create our last notebook of the lecture. It's called human in loop\nlecture. It's called human in loop\nlecture. It's called human in loop dot ipy nb. Perfect. So here let me just\ndot ipy nb. Perfect. So here let me just\ndot ipy nb. Perfect. So here let me just create a code cell and before that this\ncreate a code cell and before that this\ncreate a code cell and before that this thing and let me just create this thing.\nthing and let me just create this thing.\nthing and let me just create this thing. So here we do not need any kind of lm\nSo here we do not need any kind of lm\nSo here we do not need any kind of lm because we are not involving llm for\nbecause we are not involving llm for\nbecause we are not involving llm for now. We are simply involving the email\nnow. We are simply involving the email\nnow. We are simply involving the email and we are assuming that our llm has\nand we are assuming that our llm has\nand we are assuming that our llm has generated some text. So I will make some\ngenerated some text. So I will make some\ngenerated some text. So I will make some changes obviously. So I will simply go\nchanges obviously. So I will simply go\nchanges obviously. So I will simply go to the this command which is saying this\nto the this command which is saying this\nto the this command which is saying this thing. So action details we are not\nthing. So action details we are not\nthing. So action details we are not transferring any money. So I will simply\ntransferring any money. So I will simply\ntransferring any money. So I will simply say um I want to send daily logs.\nsay um I want to send daily logs.\nsay um I want to send daily logs. Simple send daily logs. So this is the\nSimple send daily logs. So this is the\nSimple send daily logs. So this is the not daily log or let's say daily\nnot daily log or let's say daily\nnot daily log or let's say daily summary.\nsummary.\nsummary. Simple. And the the you can say initial\nSimple. And the the you can say initial\nSimple. And the the you can say initial status is pending. Why? Let me ask you\nstatus is pending. Why? Let me ask you\nstatus is pending. Why? Let me ask you this thing. You know the answer because\nthis thing. You know the answer because\nthis thing. You know the answer because the concept that we have discussed will\nthe concept that we have discussed will\nthe concept that we have discussed will answer this question. Why the status is\nanswer this question. Why the status is\nanswer this question. Why the status is pending? Because we need to involve\npending? Because we need to involve\npending? Because we need to involve human in the loop to change the status.\nhuman in the loop to change the status.\nhuman in the loop to change the status. If you will say approved, it will\nIf you will say approved, it will\nIf you will say approved, it will approve it. If you will say reject, it\napprove it. If you will say reject, it\napprove it. If you will say reject, it will reject it. That's why I am simply\nwill reject it. That's why I am simply\nwill reject it. That's why I am simply saying pending. Currently, it is pending\nsaying pending. Currently, it is pending\nsaying pending. Currently, it is pending and it's up to you what you want to do.\nand it's up to you what you want to do.\nand it's up to you what you want to do. Simple. So, I will generate the send\nSimple. So, I will generate the send\nSimple. So, I will generate the send daily summary. Let's say this is\ndaily summary. Let's say this is\ndaily summary. Let's say this is generated by LLM node. And then I have\ngenerated by LLM node. And then I have\ngenerated by LLM node. And then I have created this status which is pending.\ncreated this status which is pending.\ncreated this status which is pending. Simple makes sense and it's very easy.\nSimple makes sense and it's very easy.\nSimple makes sense and it's very easy. So then it will simply say approved and\nSo then it will simply say approved and\nSo then it will simply say approved and rejected whatever you want to do.\nrejected whatever you want to do.\nrejected whatever you want to do. Simple. Okay. Now let's try to invoke\nSimple. Okay. Now let's try to invoke\nSimple. Okay. Now let's try to invoke it. Then you will understand it better.\nit. Then you will understand it better.\nit. Then you will understand it better. So let's say let me run it and see it is\nSo let's say let me run it and see it is\nSo let's say let me run it and see it is saying interrupt. Interrupt means\nsaying interrupt. Interrupt means\nsaying interrupt. Interrupt means there's a function called interrupt that\nthere's a function called interrupt that\nthere's a function called interrupt that we use here. Uh where is that function\nwe use here. Uh where is that function\nwe use here. Uh where is that function interrupt?\ninterrupt?\ninterrupt? You will see it somewhere. Let me just\nYou will see it somewhere. Let me just\nYou will see it somewhere. Let me just search it.\nsearch it.\nsearch it. interrupt.\ninterrupt.\ninterrupt. So initial interrupt perfect where is\nSo initial interrupt perfect where is\nSo initial interrupt perfect where is that your function? Okay, so here they\nthat your function? Okay, so here they\nthat your function? Okay, so here they are just using this function here\nare just using this function here\nare just using this function here decision interrupt. Oops. So this is the\ndecision interrupt. Oops. So this is the\ndecision interrupt. Oops. So this is the function. So this is a built-in function\nfunction. So this is a built-in function\nfunction. So this is a built-in function for interrupting the workflow.\nfor interrupting the workflow.\nfor interrupting the workflow. Okay, by lang graph and here it will ask\nOkay, by lang graph and here it will ask\nOkay, by lang graph and here it will ask you what JSON you want to provide\nyou what JSON you want to provide\nyou what JSON you want to provide question and obviously some details so\nquestion and obviously some details so\nquestion and obviously some details so that reader can actually see something\nthat reader can actually see something\nthat reader can actually see something right and here I have got the same\nright and here I have got the same\nright and here I have got the same message here the workflow is interrupted\nmessage here the workflow is interrupted\nmessage here the workflow is interrupted and question is approve this action it\nand question is approve this action it\nand question is approve this action it is asking me and details is send daily\nis asking me and details is send daily\nis asking me and details is send daily summary and here you can imagine that\nsummary and here you can imagine that\nsummary and here you can imagine that there are some daily summary written by\nthere are some daily summary written by\nthere are some daily summary written by LLM so you will read it h okay okay okay\nLLM so you will read it h okay okay okay\nLLM so you will read it h okay okay okay if you are fine If you are fine with it,\nif you are fine If you are fine with it,\nif you are fine If you are fine with it, then you need to reinvoke this graph.\nthen you need to reinvoke this graph.\nthen you need to reinvoke this graph. Let me just go to the next line. And\nLet me just go to the next line. And\nLet me just go to the next line. And here you will just reinvoke this graph\nhere you will just reinvoke this graph\nhere you will just reinvoke this graph using this line. Let's say now I want to\nusing this line. Let's say now I want to\nusing this line. Let's say now I want to reinvoke this graph. I'll simply say\nreinvoke this graph. I'll simply say\nreinvoke this graph. I'll simply say um resumed status is equals to approved\num resumed status is equals to approved\num resumed status is equals to approved uh resume. Yeah. So let's say let me\nuh resume. Yeah. So let's say let me\nuh resume. Yeah. So let's say let me just invoke this thing.\njust invoke this thing.\njust invoke this thing. Perfect. So here I just simply ran this\nPerfect. So here I just simply ran this\nPerfect. So here I just simply ran this as well. Okay. So that is fine. Let me\nas well. Okay. So that is fine. Let me\nas well. Okay. So that is fine. Let me just remove this area from here. By the\njust remove this area from here. By the\njust remove this area from here. By the way, it didn't run because it simply\nway, it didn't run because it simply\nway, it didn't run because it simply three was this thing in the interrupt\nthree was this thing in the interrupt\nthree was this thing in the interrupt code. So that is also a good thing. But\ncode. So that is also a good thing. But\ncode. So that is also a good thing. But I can just remove it and put it in the\nI can just remove it and put it in the\nI can just remove it and put it in the next cell because it makes more sense.\nnext cell because it makes more sense.\nnext cell because it makes more sense. Let me just run it again. See, same\nLet me just run it again. See, same\nLet me just run it again. See, same thing. Nothing has changed. But now I'm\nthing. Nothing has changed. But now I'm\nthing. Nothing has changed. But now I'm simply saying that I want to resume it,\nsimply saying that I want to resume it,\nsimply saying that I want to resume it, right? Because resume is equals to true.\nright? Because resume is equals to true.\nright? Because resume is equals to true. I want to resume it. So now what will\nI want to resume it. So now what will\nI want to resume it. So now what will happen? It is approved.\nhappen? It is approved.\nhappen? It is approved. Now it is approved. That means it has\nNow it is approved.

Then, we'll move on to types of different multi-agent\ntypes of different multi-agent\ntypes of different multi-agent collaboration. More specifically, we\ncollaboration. More specifically, we\ncollaboration. More specifically, we will look into the structure of\nwill look into the structure of\nwill look into the structure of multi-agent systems and there are quite\nmulti-agent systems and there are quite\nmulti-agent systems and there are quite a few structures there. Particularly we\na few structures there. Particularly we\na few structures there. Particularly we will implement the hierarchical\nwill implement the hierarchical\nwill implement the hierarchical multi-agent system in Python of course\nmulti-agent system in Python of course\nmulti-agent system in Python of course and we will be using the langraph\nand we will be using the langraph\nand we will be using the langraph framework for implementation. So let's\nframework for implementation. So let's\nframework for implementation. So let's get started. Now before we jump straight\nget started. Now before we jump straight\nget started. Now before we jump straight into multi- aent system let's understand\ninto multi- aent system let's understand\ninto multi- aent system let's understand what are the problems with single agent\nwhat are the problems with single agent\nwhat are the problems with single agent system. As the agents become more and\nsystem. As the agents become more and\nsystem. As the agents become more and more commonplace in today's world the\nmore commonplace in today's world the\nmore commonplace in today's world the complexity increases. You know the there\ncomplexity increases. You know the there\ncomplexity increases. You know the there is always commercial systems are always\nis always commercial systems are always\nis always commercial systems are always complicated and so the complexity is\ncomplicated and so the complexity is\ncomplicated and so the complexity is quite high. So scaling these agentic\nquite high. So scaling these agentic\nquite high. So scaling these agentic systems becomes quite a big challenge\nsystems becomes quite a big challenge\nsystems becomes quite a big challenge like in any organization we have you\nlike in any organization we have you\nlike in any organization we have you know we have an accountant we have a\nknow we have an accountant we have a\nknow we have an accountant we have a lawyer and we also uh have someone who's\nlawyer and we also uh have someone who's\nlawyer and we also uh have someone who's taking care of commercials and someone\ntaking care of commercials and someone\ntaking care of commercials and someone who's taking care of technicals.\nwho's taking care of technicals.\nwho's taking care of technicals. Similarly, we need specializations among\nSimilarly, we need specializations among\nSimilarly, we need specializations among these agents. And instead of having a\nthese agents. And instead of having a\nthese agents. And instead of having a generic single agent that takes care of\ngeneric single agent that takes care of\ngeneric single agent that takes care of everything, we feel that specialization\neverything, we feel that specialization\neverything, we feel that specialization and decision branching is crucial for\nand decision branching is crucial for\nand decision branching is crucial for these agentic systems to collaborate and\nthese agentic systems to collaborate and\nthese agentic systems to collaborate and work together. And also there's a need\nwork together. And also there's a need\nwork together. And also there's a need for a error checking. Take an example\nfor a error checking. Take an example\nfor a error checking. Take an example where we have two agents. One agent is\nwhere we have two agents. One agent is\nwhere we have two agents. One agent is doing the actual task. The other one is\ndoing the actual task. The other one is\ndoing the actual task. The other one is actually supervising it. So it makes\nactually supervising it. So it makes\nactually supervising it. So it makes much more sense for the first one to be\nmuch more sense for the first one to be\nmuch more sense for the first one to be corrected whenever it does some mistakes\ncorrected whenever it does some mistakes\ncorrected whenever it does some mistakes because there's a second agent that's\nbecause there's a second agent that's\nbecause there's a second agent that's actually monitoring it. So when it comes\nactually monitoring it. So when it comes\nactually monitoring it. So when it comes to error checking and selfcorrection,\nto error checking and selfcorrection,\nto error checking and selfcorrection, it's makes sense to have multiple\nit's makes sense to have multiple\nit's makes sense to have multiple agents. And we also need to combine\nagents. And we also need to combine\nagents. And we also need to combine diverse models. For example, if you're\ndiverse models. For example, if you're\ndiverse models. For example, if you're doing a large coding task, we can go for\ndoing a large coding task, we can go for\ndoing a large coding task, we can go for the set model which is uh which is good\nthe set model which is uh which is good\nthe set model which is uh which is good at coding and then we can have some\nat coding and then we can have some\nat coding and then we can have some other model like openAI's GPT models in\nother model like openAI's GPT models in\nother model like openAI's GPT models in order to do some analysis or to you know\norder to do some analysis or to you know\norder to do some analysis or to you know gather some requirements. So combining\ngather some requirements. So combining\ngather some requirements. So combining diverse models is possible if we have\ndiverse models is possible if we have\ndiverse models is possible if we have multiple agents doing different task. So\nmultiple agents doing different task. So\nmultiple agents doing different task. So the solution lies in multi- aent\nthe solution lies in multi- aent\nthe solution lies in multi- aent systems. So talking of multi-agent\nsystems. So talking of multi-agent\nsystems. So talking of multi-agent system there's a very nice paper about\nsystem there's a very nice paper about\nsystem there's a very nice paper about multi-agent collaboration mechanism and\nmulti-agent collaboration mechanism and\nmulti-agent collaboration mechanism and which is a survey of multi-agent systems\nwhich is a survey of multi-agent systems\nwhich is a survey of multi-agent systems specific to LLMs and this paper talks of\nspecific to LLMs and this paper talks of\nspecific to LLMs and this paper talks of you know different multi- aent system\nyou know different multi- aent system\nyou know different multi- aent system collaborations multi-agent collaboration\ncollaborations multi-agent collaboration\ncollaborations multi-agent collaboration can be classified based on the type of\ncan be classified based on the type of\ncan be classified based on the type of collaboration for example the agents can\ncollaboration for example the agents can\ncollaboration for example the agents can be cooperative or competitive one agent\nbe cooperative or competitive one agent\nbe cooperative or competitive one agent is competing against the other and so\nis competing against the other and so\nis competing against the other and so you get the best performance out of the\nyou get the best performance out of the\nyou get the best performance out of the system or there could be cooperation as\nsystem or there could be cooperation as\nsystem or there could be cooperation as to a single goal that they need to\nto a single goal that they need to\nto a single goal that they need to achieve. And you can also classify\nachieve. And you can also classify\nachieve. And you can also classify multi- aent collaboration based on the\nmulti- aent collaboration based on the\nmulti- aent collaboration based on the structure. For example, you could have a\nstructure. For example, you could have a\nstructure. For example, you could have a centralized structure or you could have\ncentralized structure or you could have\ncentralized structure or you could have a distributed one or you could have a\na distributed one or you could have a\na distributed one or you could have a hierarchical one. And this hierarchical\nhierarchical one. And this hierarchical\nhierarchical one. And this hierarchical one is the one that we are going to\none is the one that we are going to\none is the one that we are going to implement today. And you can also have\nimplement today. And you can also have\nimplement today. And you can also have multi- aent collaboration based on the\nmulti- aent collaboration based on the\nmulti- aent collaboration based on the strategies. For example, it can be\nstrategies. For example, it can be\nstrategies. For example, it can be rule-based. It can be you know model\nrule-based. It can be you know model\nrule-based. It can be you know model based and it can even be role based. You\nbased and it can even be role based. You\nbased and it can even be role based. You can have separate roles for separate\ncan have separate roles for separate\ncan have separate roles for separate agents. For example, in a in a coding\nagents. For example, in a in a coding\nagents. For example, in a in a coding task, one can be a reviewer which is\ntask, one can be a reviewer which is\ntask, one can be a reviewer which is which acts as a senior developer and the\nwhich acts as a senior developer and the\nwhich acts as a senior developer and the other one can be an architect agent\nother one can be an architect agent\nother one can be an architect agent which is going to actually architect the\nwhich is going to actually architect the\nwhich is going to actually architect the system. So there are different ways in\nsystem. So there are different ways in\nsystem. So there are different ways in which multi- aent systems can be\nwhich multi- aent systems can be\nwhich multi- aent systems can be coordinated or orchestrated just based\ncoordinated or orchestrated just based\ncoordinated or orchestrated just based on the structure itself. We can have a\non the structure itself. We can have a\non the structure itself. We can have a supervisor agent supervisor as a tool\nsupervisor agent supervisor as a tool\nsupervisor agent supervisor as a tool and we can have a network structure, we\nand we can have a network structure, we\nand we can have a network structure, we can have hierarchical structure or we\ncan have hierarchical structure or we\ncan have hierarchical structure or we can have custom design. So in case of a\ncan have custom design. So in case of a\ncan have custom design. So in case of a network structure, we can have you know\nnetwork structure, we can have you know\nnetwork structure, we can have you know agents collaborating like this. In in\nagents collaborating like this. In in\nagents collaborating like this. In in this example, we have four agents and\nthis example, we have four agents and\nthis example, we have four agents and the communication between the four\nthe communication between the four\nthe communication between the four agents is possible in any direction. So\nagents is possible in any direction. So\nagents is possible in any direction. So as you can see this could easily lead to\nas you can see this could easily lead to\nas you can see this could easily lead to chaos because we have not defined the\nchaos because we have not defined the\nchaos because we have not defined the role of each of the agents and each one\nrole of each of the agents and each one\nrole of each of the agents and each one can do whatever it likes and pass on the\ncan do whatever it likes and pass on the\ncan do whatever it likes and pass on the control to a different agent. So that\ncontrol to a different agent. So that\ncontrol to a different agent. So that leads us to the next type of\nleads us to the next type of\nleads us to the next type of collaboration which is the supervisor\ncollaboration which is the supervisor\ncollaboration which is the supervisor structure. Here we have a well-defined\nstructure. Here we have a well-defined\nstructure. Here we have a well-defined supervisor with which all the other\nsupervisor with which all the other\nsupervisor with which all the other agents are reporting to or communicating\nagents are reporting to or communicating\nagents are reporting to or communicating to. So the supervisor can nicely\nto. So the supervisor can nicely\nto. So the supervisor can nicely coordinate the execution of the task\ncoordinate the execution of the task\ncoordinate the execution of the task between all the sub aents or the\nbetween all the sub aents or the\nbetween all the sub aents or the different teams and so there's nice\ndifferent teams and so there's nice\ndifferent teams and so there's nice control of the execution of the task.\ncontrol of the execution of the task.\ncontrol of the execution of the task. But again the drawback here is that if\nBut again the drawback here is that if\nBut again the drawback here is that if this if this supervisor agent collapses\nthis if this supervisor agent collapses\nthis if this supervisor agent collapses for some reason then the whole system\nfor some reason then the whole system\nfor some reason then the whole system breaks down. So this becomes a single\nbreaks down. So this becomes a single\nbreaks down. So this becomes a single point of failure. So that's something we\npoint of failure. So that's something we\npoint of failure. So that's something we need to keep in mind if you are building\nneed to keep in mind if you are building\nneed to keep in mind if you are building a supervisor based agentic system. Then\na supervisor based agentic system. Then\na supervisor based agentic system. Then comes supervisor as a tool or supervisor\ncomes supervisor as a tool or supervisor\ncomes supervisor as a tool or supervisor tool calling. In this case we have the\ntool calling. In this case we have the\ntool calling. In this case we have the different agents which expose themselves\ndifferent agents which expose themselves\ndifferent agents which expose themselves to the supervisor in the form of a tool.\nto the supervisor in the form of a tool.\nto the supervisor in the form of a tool. So basically supervisor treats them as a\nSo basically supervisor treats them as a\nSo basically supervisor treats them as a tool rather than an agent and this is a\ntool rather than an agent and this is a\ntool rather than an agent and this is a small variation to the supervisor\nsmall variation to the supervisor\nsmall variation to the supervisor structure and it's called the supervisor\nstructure and it's called the supervisor\nstructure and it's called the supervisor as tool or supervisor tool calling. The\nas tool or supervisor tool calling. The\nas tool or supervisor tool calling. The next type is that of hierarchical where\nnext type is that of hierarchical where\nnext type is that of hierarchical where we can see that there is a supervisor on\nwe can see that there is a supervisor on\nwe can see that there is a supervisor on top and below that there is another\ntop and below that there is another\ntop and below that there is another supervisor but this supervisor agent has\nsupervisor but this supervisor agent has\nsupervisor but this supervisor agent has a team and it's got two agents reporting\na team and it's got two agents reporting\na team and it's got two agents reporting to it. So uh so this team has a separate\nto it. So uh so this team has a separate\nto it. So uh so this team has a separate role to play. Similarly on the other\nrole to play. Similarly on the other\nrole to play. Similarly on the other side we have a separate supervisor and\nside we have a separate supervisor and\nside we have a separate supervisor and this supervisor has couple of agents\nthis supervisor has couple of agents\nthis supervisor has couple of agents reporting to it and these three together\nreporting to it and these three together\nreporting to it and these three together form a team and this team in turn\nform a team and this team in turn\nform a team and this team in turn reports to the supervisor. So we can\nreports to the supervisor. So we can\nreports to the supervisor. So we can imagine this as kind of how an\nimagine this as kind of how an\nimagine this as kind of how an organization is structured. So we have\norganization is structured. So we have\norganization is structured. So we have let's say the CEO or CTO and we have say\nlet's say the CEO or CTO and we have say\nlet's say the CEO or CTO and we have say the technical team which is reporting\nthe technical team which is reporting\nthe technical team which is reporting back to it and the technical team is\nback to it and the technical team is\nback to it and the technical team is probably led by a tech lead or somebody\nprobably led by a tech lead or somebody\nprobably led by a tech lead or somebody else and we have a commercial team that\nelse and we have a commercial team that\nelse and we have a commercial team that takes care of the commercials and the\ntakes care of the commercials and the\ntakes care of the commercials and the commercial team again reports back to\ncommercial team again reports back to\ncommercial team again reports back to the head of the organization. So this is\nthe head of the organization. So this is\nthe head of the organization. So this is the exact structure that we are going to\nthe exact structure that we are going to\nthe exact structure that we are going to implement today. So when I say\nimplement today. So when I say\nimplement today. So when I say implement, we are going to implement the\nimplement, we are going to implement the\nimplement, we are going to implement the hierarchical multi- aent system using\nhierarchical multi- aent system using\nhierarchical multi- aent system using langraph framework and we are going to\nlangraph framework and we are going to\nlangraph framework and we are going to build a blog writing agentic system. So\nbuild a blog writing agentic system. So\nbuild a blog writing agentic system. So we will have a researcher team and we\nwe will have a researcher team and we\nwe will have a researcher team and we will have a writing team as well. The\nwill have a writing team as well. The\nwill have a writing team as well. The researcher agent team and the writing\nresearcher agent team and the writing\nresearcher agent team and the writing agent team report to the supervisor\nagent team report to the supervisor\nagent team report to the supervisor agent and the supervisor a and the\nagent and the supervisor a and the\nagent and the supervisor a and the supervisor agent coordinates the\nsupervisor agent coordinates the\nsupervisor agent coordinates the execution of the task to achieve the end\nexecution of the task to achieve the end\nexecution of the task to achieve the end goal. These teams in turn have this kind\ngoal. These teams in turn have this kind\ngoal. These teams in turn have this kind of tools. For example, in order to do\nof tools. For example, in order to do\nof tools. For example, in order to do research, it needs access to web. So we\nresearch, it needs access to web. So we\nresearch, it needs access to web. So we will have a web scraper and a web search\nwill have a web scraper and a web search\nwill have a web scraper and a web search tool that is available readily to the\ntool that is available readily to the\ntool that is available readily to the research agent team. And we will have a\nresearch agent team. And we will have a\nresearch agent team. And we will have a writing team which of course needs to\nwriting team which of course needs to\nwriting team which of course needs to write or you know jot down bullet points\nwrite or you know jot down bullet points\nwrite or you know jot down bullet points and take notes. So we will have a\nand take notes. So we will have a\nand take notes. So we will have a writing tool. We will have a note-taking\nwriting tool. We will have a note-taking\nwriting tool. We will have a note-taking tool and we will have a chart generator\ntool and we will have a chart generator\ntool and we will have a chart generator tool. For example, if you want this\ntool. For example, if you want this\ntool. For example, if you want this agent to generate a report of say some\nagent to generate a report of say some\nagent to generate a report of say some financials then it needs to do some\nfinancials then it needs to do some\nfinancials then it needs to do some chart and come up with a report. So this\nchart and come up with a report. So this\nchart and come up with a report. So this agent is also going to have chart\nagent is also going to have chart\nagent is also going to have chart generation capability. So equipped with\ngeneration capability. So equipped with\ngeneration capability. So equipped with these tools, the writing agent and the\nthese tools, the writing agent and the\nthese tools, the writing agent and the research agent, we will have the entire\nresearch agent, we will have the entire\nresearch agent, we will have the entire hierarchical agentic system built. So\nhierarchical agentic system built. So\nhierarchical agentic system built. So let's get our hands dirty and let's\nlet's get our hands dirty and let's\nlet's get our hands dirty and let's start coding now. So let's start by\nstart coding now. So let's start by\nstart coding now. So let's start by creating a cond environment. I'm going\ncreating a cond environment. I'm going\ncreating a cond environment. I'm going to call create minus n. Let's call it\nto call create minus n. Let's call it\nto call create minus n. Let's call it multi- aent and I'm going to use python\nmulti- aent and I'm going to use python\nmulti- aent and I'm going to use python 3.12. So that will create a new cond\n3.12. So that will create a new cond\n3.12. So that will create a new cond environment and let's let's activate the\nenvironment and let's let's activate the\nenvironment and let's let's activate the cond environment. I'm just going to do\ncond environment. I'm just going to do\ncond environment. I'm just going to do activate multi- aent and once that is\nactivate multi- aent and once that is\nactivate multi- aent and once that is activated I'm now going to install\nactivated I'm now going to install\nactivated I'm now going to install Jupyter lab with install Jupiter lab in\nJupyter lab with install Jupiter lab in\nJupyter lab with install Jupiter lab in order to run the notebook in this\norder to run the notebook in this\norder to run the notebook in this environment. So that's installing\nenvironment. So that's installing\nenvironment. So that's installing Jupiter lab. I'm going to clear. I'm now\nJupiter lab. I'm going to clear. I'm now\nJupiter lab. I'm going to clear. I'm now going to say Jupita lab and we should be\ngoing to say Jupita lab and we should be\ngoing to say Jupita lab and we should be able to write a notebook in this\nable to write a notebook in this\nable to write a notebook in this directory. So how we are going to go\ndirectory. So how we are going to go\ndirectory. So how we are going to go about implementing this is we're going\nabout implementing this is we're going\nabout implementing this is we're going to do the preliminary setup first which\nto do the preliminary setup first which\nto do the preliminary setup first which includes you know defining your openi\nincludes you know defining your openi\nincludes you know defining your openi API key and you know tavi API key\nAPI key and you know tavi API key\nAPI key and you know tavi API key whatever the API key that's needed for\nwhatever the API key that's needed for\nwhatever the API key that's needed for your tools. Then we're going to do all\nyour tools. Then we're going to do all\nyour tools. Then we're going to do all the imports that are needed or whatever\nthe imports that are needed or whatever\nthe imports that are needed or whatever the that'll make sure we have all the\nthe that'll make sure we have all the\nthe that'll make sure we have all the packages in place and they work fine.\npackages in place and they work fine.\npackages in place and they work fine. And then we're going to define the\nAnd then we're going to define the\nAnd then we're going to define the different tools. For example, web\ndifferent tools. For example, web\ndifferent tools. For example, web scraping tool or you know it's going to\nscraping tool or you know it's going to\nscraping tool or you know it's going to be a outline creation tool or reading a\nbe a outline creation tool or reading a\nbe a outline creation tool or reading a document could be a tool. Writing a\ndocument could be a tool. Writing a\ndocument could be a tool. Writing a document could be a tool. So we're going\ndocument could be a tool. So we're going\ndocument could be a tool. So we're going to define those tools. We're going to\nto define those tools. We're going to\nto define those tools. We're going to define the supervisor and once we\ndefine the supervisor and once we\ndefine the supervisor and once we implement that then we will define the\nimplement that then we will define the\nimplement that then we will define the actual teams itself which is going to be\nactual teams itself which is going to be\nactual teams itself which is going to be the researcher team and the writing\nthe researcher team and the writing\nthe researcher team and the writing team. So those are the two teams we'll\nteam. So those are the two teams we'll\nteam. So those are the two teams we'll define. We'll visualize the individual\ndefine. We'll visualize the individual\ndefine. We'll visualize the individual graphs for these two and we'll test them\ngraphs for these two and we'll test them\ngraphs for these two and we'll test them separately and make sure they work fine.\nseparately and make sure they work fine.\nseparately and make sure they work fine. And finally, we will implement the end\nAnd finally, we will implement the end\nAnd finally, we will implement the end to end graph. So the end to end graph is\nto end graph. So the end to end graph is\nto end graph. So the end to end graph is going to be the entire graph. We're\ngoing to be the entire graph. We're\ngoing to be the entire graph. We're going to put all these three together\ngoing to put all these three together\ngoing to put all these three together and we'll make sure this one works fine\nand we'll make sure this one works fine\nand we'll make sure this one works fine including all the tools that are here.\nincluding all the tools that are here.\nincluding all the tools that are here. So the whole thing needs to be tied\nSo the whole thing needs to be tied\nSo the whole thing needs to be tied together and we'll do that in the end to\ntogether and we'll do that in the end to\ntogether and we'll do that in the end to end graph and eventually we'll run the\nend graph and eventually we'll run the\nend graph and eventually we'll run the graph for some requirement. We will give\ngraph for some requirement. We will give\ngraph for some requirement. We will give a user input. We'll give a prompt which\na user input. We'll give a prompt which\na user input. We'll give a prompt which is here and we'll make sure we get the\nis here and we'll make sure we get the\nis here and we'll make sure we get the required output and the output will be\nrequired output and the output will be\nrequired output and the output will be the return article from this agent team\nthe return article from this agent team\nthe return article from this agent team which is going to get stored locally in\nwhich is going to get stored locally in\nwhich is going to get stored locally in a file. Now that we have the blocks well\na file. Now that we have the blocks well\na file. Now that we have the blocks well definfined, we just have to keep filling\ndefinfined, we just have to keep filling\ndefinfined, we just have to keep filling them. So let's start with the\nthem. So let's start with the\nthem. So let's start with the preliminary. Of course, we need the\npreliminary. Of course, we need the\npreliminary. Of course, we need the password or the API key. So I'm just\npassword or the API key. So I'm just\npassword or the API key. So I'm just going to import get pass import OS and\ngoing to import get pass import OS and\ngoing to import get pass import OS and I'm going to define set if undefined\nI'm going to define set if undefined\nI'm going to define set if undefined which is a string. What we are trying to\nwhich is a string. What we are trying to\nwhich is a string. What we are trying to do here is basically if the environment\ndo here is basically if the environment\ndo here is basically if the environment variable is not defined then we are\nvariable is not defined then we are\nvariable is not defined then we are going to get it from the user get pass\ngoing to get it from the user get pass\ngoing to get it from the user get pass dot get pass. So, so we're going to\ndot get pass. So, so we're going to\ndot get pass. So, so we're going to basically ask the user to provide that\nbasically ask the user to provide that\nbasically ask the user to provide that and we're going to say set if undefined\nand we're going to say set if undefined\nand we're going to say set if undefined of the OpenAI API key and we we also\nof the OpenAI API key and we we also\nof the OpenAI API key and we we also need the Tavili API key because we will\nneed the Tavili API key because we will\nneed the Tavili API key because we will be using Tavili. So, if you're\nbe using Tavili. So, if you're\nbe using Tavili. So, if you're unfamiliar with Tavi, it's basically to\nunfamiliar with Tavi, it's basically to\nunfamiliar with Tavi, it's basically to connect your agent to the web. That's\nconnect your agent to the web. That's\nconnect your agent to the web. That's exactly what it says on the website. You\nexactly what it says on the website. You\nexactly what it says on the website. You can use the API in order to connect your\ncan use the API in order to connect your\ncan use the API in order to connect your agent to pull data from the internet.\nagent to pull data from the internet.\nagent to pull data from the internet. So, we're going to be using this one. We\nSo, we're going to be using this one. We\nSo, we're going to be using this one. We are using this because we can see that\nare using this because we can see that\nare using this because we can see that we have thousand API credits per month\nwe have thousand API credits per month\nwe have thousand API credits per month which is free and so it'll be convenient\nwhich is free and so it'll be convenient\nwhich is free and so it'll be convenient for us to demonstrate what we can\nfor us to demonstrate what we can\nfor us to demonstrate what we can achieve for demonstrating purposes. So\nachieve for demonstrating purposes. So\nachieve for demonstrating purposes. So if we run that we need to provide the\nif we run that we need to provide the\nif we run that we need to provide the open AAI API key. I'm going to give my\nopen AAI API key. I'm going to give my\nopen AAI API key. I'm going to give my open AI API key. Enter. And so we have\nopen AI API key. Enter. And so we have\nopen AI API key. Enter. And so we have the API key set. So once we have sorted\nthe API key set. So once we have sorted\nthe API key set. So once we have sorted out the API key, we need to make sure we\nout the API key, we need to make sure we\nout the API key, we need to make sure we have uh all the Python packages. So we\nhave uh all the Python packages. So we\nhave uh all the Python packages. So we need to do pip install and a few python\nneed to do pip install and a few python\nneed to do pip install and a few python packages and everything revolves around\npackages and everything revolves around\npackages and everything revolves around the langraph and the lang chain\nthe langraph and the lang chain\nthe langraph and the lang chain ecosystem. So we're going to be using\necosystem. So we're going to be using\necosystem. So we're going to be using langraph for our implementation and\nlangraph for our implementation and\nlangraph for our implementation and we're going to be using lang chain\nwe're going to be using lang chain\nwe're going to be using lang chain community lang chain probably not lang\ncommunity lang chain probably not lang\ncommunity lang chain probably not lang chain anthropic. So we're going to be\nchain anthropic. So we're going to be\nchain anthropic. So we're going to be using langraph for our implementation of\nusing langraph for our implementation of\nusing langraph for our implementation of the of the multi- aent system and we're\nthe of the multi- aent system and we're\nthe of the multi- aent system and we're going to be using lang chain community\ngoing to be using lang chain community\ngoing to be using lang chain community langchain tavili for uh the browser and\nlangchain tavili for uh the browser and\nlangchain tavili for uh the browser and we're going to be using lang chain\nwe're going to be using lang chain\nwe're going to be using lang chain experimental. So let's run that and that\nexperimental. So let's run that and that\nexperimental. So let's run that and that will take care of all the installations.\nwill take care of all the installations.\nwill take care of all the installations. So with the installations out of the way\nSo with the installations out of the way\nSo with the installations out of the way let's let's define some of the tools\nlet's let's define some of the tools\nlet's let's define some of the tools that we need. Let's go back and have a\nthat we need. Let's go back and have a\nthat we need. Let's go back and have a look at the tools that we need. So we\nlook at the tools that we need. So we\nlook at the tools that we need. So we need a web scraper and we also need the\nneed a web scraper and we also need the\nneed a web scraper and we also need the ability to write and read documents\nability to write and read documents\nability to write and read documents because the noteaker and writer are\nbecause the noteaker and writer are\nbecause the noteaker and writer are going to write to the disk and the chart\ngoing to write to the disk and the chart\ngoing to write to the disk and the chart generator is interesting. It also needs\ngenerator is interesting. It also needs\ngenerator is interesting. It also needs to create graphs or plots using data.\nto create graphs or plots using data.\nto create graphs or plots using data. For that we need to make sure we are\nFor that we need to make sure we are\nFor that we need to make sure we are able to run some Python code. We'll see\nable to run some Python code. We'll see\nable to run some Python code. We'll see how we will go about it. But for now\nhow we will go about it. But for now\nhow we will go about it. But for now let's implement these tools for reading,\nlet's implement these tools for reading,\nlet's implement these tools for reading, writing documents and also web scraping.\nwriting documents and also web scraping.\nwriting documents and also web scraping. So define\nSo define\nSo define script web pages. It's going to take\nscript web pages. It's going to take\nscript web pages. It's going to take URLs and it's going to be a list of\nURLs and it's going to be a list of\nURLs and it's going to be a list of string and it's going to return a string\nstring and it's going to return a string\nstring and it's going to return a string as well. And so the loader is the web\nas well. And so the loader is the web\nas well. And so the loader is the web base loader. It's going to load the URL\nbase loader. It's going to load the URL\nbase loader. It's going to load the URL and the docs is loader.load.\nand the docs is loader.load.\nand the docs is loader.load. We're going to load the doc and then we\nWe're going to load the doc and then we\nWe're going to load the doc and then we going to return whatever has been\ngoing to return whatever has been\ngoing to return whatever has been loaded. We're going to format it a bit.\nloaded. We're going to format it a bit.\nloaded. We're going to format it a bit. So we're going to do join document name\nSo we're going to do join document name\nSo we're going to do join document name is doc do metadata get title and page\nis doc do metadata get title and page\nis doc do metadata get title and page content and we're going to close the\ncontent and we're going to close the\ncontent and we're going to close the document tag. So if this is in single\ndocument tag. So if this is in single\ndocument tag. So if this is in single quotes then hopefully it will be fine\nquotes then hopefully it will be fine\nquotes then hopefully it will be fine now and we need to close the square\nnow and we need to close the square\nnow and we need to close the square brackets and we need to close the join\nbrackets and we need to close the join\nbrackets and we need to close the join bracket as well. So hopefully so list is\nbracket as well. So hopefully so list is\nbracket as well. So hopefully so list is not defined and we also need to import\nnot defined and we also need to import\nnot defined and we also need to import webbased loader. So this is where we\nwebbased loader. So this is where we\nwebbased loader. So this is where we need to import from typing import. We\nneed to import from typing import. We\nneed to import from typing import. We might need annotated as well. So I'm\nmight need annotated as well. So I'm\nmight need annotated as well. So I'm just importing it now. And then I'm\njust importing it now. And then I'm\njust importing it now. And then I'm going to say from lang chain community\ngoing to say from lang chain community\ngoing to say from lang chain community document loader. I'm going to import web\ndocument loader. I'm going to import web\ndocument loader. I'm going to import web base webbased loader. If I run that, we\nbase webbased loader. If I run that, we\nbase webbased loader. If I run that, we can see that those are fine. And this\ncan see that those are fine. And this\ncan see that those are fine. And this runs fine too. In order to make it a\nruns fine too. In order to make it a\nruns fine too. In order to make it a tool, we just have to decorate with\ntool, we just have to decorate with\ntool, we just have to decorate with tools. So that will make sure that's one\ntools. So that will make sure that's one\ntools. So that will make sure that's one of the tools. Similarly, we now need to\nof the tools. Similarly, we now need to\nof the tools. Similarly, we now need to create few more tools. One is the create\ncreate few more tools. One is the create\ncreate few more tools. One is the create outline tool. Next one is the uh read\noutline tool. Next one is the uh read\noutline tool. Next one is the uh read document tool. Document tool. Next one\ndocument tool. Document tool. Next one\ndocument tool. Document tool. Next one is to write document. And the next one\nis to write document. And the next one\nis to write document. And the next one is to edit documents. So these are the\nis to edit documents. So these are the\nis to edit documents. So these are the main file related tools that we need and\nmain file related tools that we need and\nmain file related tools that we need and I'm going to decorate everything with\nI'm going to decorate everything with\nI'm going to decorate everything with tool because these are going to be our\ntool because these are going to be our\ntool because these are going to be our tools that we're going to use. Right? So\ntools that we're going to use. Right? So\ntools that we're going to use. Right? So now let's go to create outline. This is\nnow let's go to create outline. This is\nnow let's go to create outline. This is basically all about writing an outline\nbasically all about writing an outline\nbasically all about writing an outline to a file. So I'm just going to say\nto a file. So I'm just going to say\nto a file. So I'm just going to say we're going to get the input points\nwe're going to get the input points\nwe're going to get the input points which is going to be in a bullet points\nwhich is going to be in a bullet points\nwhich is going to be in a bullet points and I'm going to do list of string.\nand I'm going to do list of string.\nand I'm going to do list of string. We're going to get a list of string,\nWe're going to get a list of string,\nWe're going to get a list of string, list of main points or sections and we\nlist of main points or sections and we\nlist of main points or sections and we also going to get a file name where it\nalso going to get a file name where it\nalso going to get a file name where it will be stored and we are going to\nwill be stored and we are going to\nwill be stored and we are going to annotate it again as a string of file\nannotate it again as a string of file\nannotate it again as a string of file path to save the outline and we're going\npath to save the outline and we're going\npath to save the outline and we're going to return annotated of string path of\nto return annotated of string path of\nto return annotated of string path of the saved outline file. So basically we\nthe saved outline file. So basically we\nthe saved outline file. So basically we are just going to create a outline file\nare just going to create a outline file\nare just going to create a outline file while the agent is going to create an\nwhile the agent is going to create an\nwhile the agent is going to create an outline file and it's going to return\noutline file and it's going to return\noutline file and it's going to return the path of the saved output file. It's\nthe path of the saved output file. It's\nthe path of the saved output file. It's a standard Python function now o.path\na standard Python function now o.path\na standard Python function now o.path dot join o.get current working\ndot join o.get current working\ndot join o.get current working directory. So I'm basically going to\ndirectory. So I'm basically going to\ndirectory. So I'm basically going to create a temp directory under my current\ncreate a temp directory under my current\ncreate a temp directory under my current project working directory and I'm going\nproject working directory and I'm going\nproject working directory and I'm going to use that temp directory to store all\nto use that temp directory to store all\nto use that temp directory to store all the temp files or whatever the files\nthe temp files or whatever the files\nthe temp files or whatever the files that the agent is creating. So I'm going\nthat the agent is creating. So I'm going\nthat the agent is creating. So I'm going to open that file as a in write mode and\nto open that file as a in write mode and\nto open that file as a in write mode and I'm just going to write each of the\nI'm just going to write each of the\nI'm just going to write each of the points. So I'm going to iterate through\npoints. So I'm going to iterate through\npoints. So I'm going to iterate through the points and I'm just going to do\nthe points and I'm just going to do\nthe points and I'm just going to do file.right Right. And I'm just going to\nfile.right Right. And I'm just going to\nfile.right Right. And I'm just going to give numbers basically. So I + 1 which\ngive numbers basically. So I + 1 which\ngive numbers basically. So I + 1 which would be 1. And I'm going to enter the\nwould be 1. And I'm going to enter the\nwould be 1. And I'm going to enter the point there. And it's a new line. Move\npoint there. And it's a new line. Move\npoint there. And it's a new line. Move on to a new line. And once we are done\non to a new line. And once we are done\non to a new line. And once we are done with that, we are going to be returning\nwith that, we are going to be returning\nwith that, we are going to be returning outline saved to file name. So we're\noutline saved to file name. So we're\noutline saved to file name. So we're going to say where the file is saved. So\ngoing to say where the file is saved. So\ngoing to say where the file is saved. So that is create outline. Obviously I need\nthat is create outline. Obviously I need\nthat is create outline. Obviously I need to import OS now. So import OS I need to\nto import OS now. So import OS I need to\nto import OS now. So import OS I need to close the brackets. So so one of the\nclose the brackets. So so one of the\nclose the brackets. So so one of the things is that we need to give dock\nthings is that we need to give dock\nthings is that we need to give dock string for these tools in order for them\nstring for these tools in order for them\nstring for these tools in order for them to be recognized by the agent. And so we\nto be recognized by the agent. And so we\nto be recognized by the agent. And so we need to just give a dock string saying\nneed to just give a dock string saying\nneed to just give a dock string saying that create and save an outline file\nthat create and save an outline file\nthat create and save an outline file syntax error. So let's run this. It says\nsyntax error. So let's run this. It says\nsyntax error. So let's run this. It says tool is not defined because we haven't\ntool is not defined because we haven't\ntool is not defined because we haven't imported tool. I'm just going to say\nimported tool. I'm just going to say\nimported tool. I'm just going to say from lang chain core dotto tools import\nfrom lang chain core dotto tools import\nfrom lang chain core dotto tools import tool. So I've imported tool so that\ntool. So I've imported tool so that\ntool. So I've imported tool so that shouldn't complain now. So all the tools\nshouldn't complain now. So all the tools\nshouldn't complain now. So all the tools should have a dock string. So that's\nshould have a dock string. So that's\nshould have a dock string. So that's what it's complaining about. I'm going\nwhat it's complaining about. I'm going\nwhat it's complaining about. I'm going to give a dock string for the scrape web\nto give a dock string for the scrape web\nto give a dock string for the scrape web pages too which is use requests and bs4\npages too which is use requests and bs4\npages too which is use requests and bs4 to scrape the provided web pages for\nto scrape the provided web pages for\nto scrape the provided web pages for detailed information. Right? Because we\ndetailed information. Right? Because we\ndetailed information. Right? Because we have defined these ones as tools as\nhave defined these ones as tools as\nhave defined these ones as tools as well. It expects a a doc string for all\nwell. It expects a a doc string for all\nwell. It expects a a doc string for all these we're going to provide for each of\nthese we're going to provide for each of\nthese we're going to provide for each of this read the specified document. Let's\nthis read the specified document. Let's\nthis read the specified document. Let's see how we can implement that. And so\nsee how we can implement that. And so\nsee how we can implement that. And so again file to use is going to be oath\nagain file to use is going to be oath\nagain file to use is going to be oath join o.get current working directory and\njoin o.get current working directory and\njoin o.get current working directory and we're going to be in temp and we're\nwe're going to be in temp and we're\nwe're going to be in temp and we're going to get the file name as input. So\ngoing to get the file name as input. So\ngoing to get the file name as input. So I'm I need to define the file name in as\nI'm I need to define the file name in as\nI'm I need to define the file name in as one of the parameters. Again it's going\none of the parameters. Again it's going\none of the parameters. Again it's going to be annotated as string of file path\nto be annotated as string of file path\nto be annotated as string of file path to read the document from start is going\nto read the document from start is going\nto read the document from start is going to be a optional integer. the start\nto be a optional integer. the start\nto be a optional integer. the start line. We're going to make sure that we\nline. We're going to make sure that we\nline. We're going to make sure that we have the ability to provide a start\nhave the ability to provide a start\nhave the ability to provide a start line. But if the default is zero, which\nline. But if the default is zero, which\nline. But if the default is zero, which means by default it reads everything.\nmeans by default it reads everything.\nmeans by default it reads everything. And in for the end again it's going to\nAnd in for the end again it's going to\nAnd in for the end again it's going to be optional and it's again going to be\nbe optional and it's again going to be\nbe optional and it's again going to be an integer which says the end line\nan integer which says the end line\nan integer which says the end line default is none. Let's close it and it's\ndefault is none. Let's close it and it's\ndefault is none. Let's close it and it's going to be none. So we have defined\ngoing to be none. So we have defined\ngoing to be none. So we have defined those three inputs. Now the file to use\nthose three inputs. Now the file to use\nthose three inputs. Now the file to use is that. So we open the file open file\nis that. So we open the file open file\nis that. So we open the file open file to use in for reading and we are going\nto use in for reading and we are going\nto use in for reading and we are going to simply get the lines from it. So file\nto simply get the lines from it. So file\nto simply get the lines from it. So file dot read lines and if start is none\ndot read lines and if start is none\ndot read lines and if start is none we're going to set start to zero and we\nwe're going to set start to zero and we\nwe're going to set start to zero and we are going to return going to join all\nare going to return going to join all\nare going to return going to join all the lines from the start to the end and\nthe lines from the start to the end and\nthe lines from the start to the end and we are going to return that. So that's\nwe are going to return that. So that's\nwe are going to return that. So that's three documents. Now we can move on to\nthree documents. Now we can move on to\nthree documents. Now we can move on to write documents. So for the write\nwrite documents. So for the write\nwrite documents. So for the write document we need to create and save a\ndocument we need to create and save a\ndocument we need to create and save a text document. We're going to again get\ntext document. We're going to again get\ntext document. We're going to again get the file to use which is going to be\nthe file to use which is going to be\nthe file to use which is going to be from the file name that we get as input.\nfrom the file name that we get as input.\nfrom the file name that we get as input. But in the input we also going to have\nBut in the input we also going to have\nBut in the input we also going to have the content that we're going to write.\nthe content that we're going to write.\nthe content that we're going to write. So we're going to say annotated of of\nSo we're going to say annotated of of\nSo we're going to say annotated of of string and we're going to say text\nstring and we're going to say text\nstring and we're going to say text content to be return to the document.\ncontent to be return to the document.\ncontent to be return to the document. And for the file name, file path to save\nAnd for the file name, file path to save\nAnd for the file name, file path to save the document. Right? So those are the\nthe document. Right? So those are the\nthe document. Right? So those are the two inputs again. So file to use is\ntwo inputs again. So file to use is\ntwo inputs again. So file to use is os.path dot join get current working\nos.path dot join get current working\nos.path dot join get current working directory temp and file name which we\ndirectory temp and file name which we\ndirectory temp and file name which we get from the input and we are opening\nget from the input and we are opening\nget from the input and we are opening it. Nothing really fancy here. It's just\nit. Nothing really fancy here. It's just\nit. Nothing really fancy here. It's just basic python reading and writing of\nbasic python reading and writing of\nbasic python reading and writing of files going on. But within the context\nfiles going on. But within the context\nfiles going on. But within the context of lang. So because with this function\nof lang. So because with this function\nof lang. So because with this function is decorated as a tool we need to follow\nis decorated as a tool we need to follow\nis decorated as a tool we need to follow this protocol such as you know providing\nthis protocol such as you know providing\nthis protocol such as you know providing a doc string. So with open file file\na doc string. So with open file file\na doc string. So with open file file write content and we return document\nwrite content and we return document\nwrite content and we return document save to and file name. So that is about\nsave to and file name. So that is about\nsave to and file name. So that is about writing the file. Now we need to make\nwriting the file. Now we need to make\nwriting the file. Now we need to make sure we are able to edit the file as\nsure we are able to edit the file as\nsure we are able to edit the file as well. So for the editing edit document,\nwell. So for the editing edit document,\nwell. So for the editing edit document, we're going to say edit a document by\nwe're going to say edit a document by\nwe're going to say edit a document by inserting text as at specified line\ninserting text as at specified line\ninserting text as at specified line numbers. So that's edit documents and\nnumbers. So that's edit documents and\nnumbers. So that's edit documents and we're going to again get the file to\nwe're going to again get the file to\nwe're going to again get the file to use. We're going to get the uh file\nuse. We're going to get the uh file\nuse. We're going to get the uh file name. I'm just going to copy and paste\nname. I'm just going to copy and paste\nname. I'm just going to copy and paste it here. And the insert is going to be\nit here. And the insert is going to be\nit here. And the insert is going to be an a dictionary of integer and string\nan a dictionary of integer and string\nan a dictionary of integer and string dictionary where key is the line number\ndictionary where key is the line number\ndictionary where key is the line number and value is the text to be inserted at\nand value is the text to be inserted at\nand value is the text to be inserted at the line number. Hope it makes sense. So\nthe line number. Hope it makes sense. So\nthe line number. Hope it makes sense. So we need to provide a location where the\nwe need to provide a location where the\nwe need to provide a location where the where the text has to be inserted and we\nwhere the text has to be inserted and we\nwhere the text has to be inserted and we also obviously need to provide the file\nalso obviously need to provide the file\nalso obviously need to provide the file which needs to be edited and we're just\nwhich needs to be edited and we're just\nwhich needs to be edited and we're just going to open it and we're going to\ngoing to open it and we're going to\ngoing to open it and we're going to write to it. So open file to use in\nwrite to it. So open file to use in\nwrite to it. So open file to use in write mode as file. So we are sorting it\nwrite mode as file. So we are sorting it\nwrite mode as file. So we are sorting it and we are going to iterate through the\nand we are going to iterate through the\nand we are going to iterate through the each of the we're going to iterate the\neach of the we're going to iterate the\neach of the we're going to iterate the and we are going to insert the data\nand we are going to insert the data\nand we are going to insert the data here. So line number minus one text plus\nhere. So line number minus one text plus\nhere. So line number minus one text plus and we also going to insert a new line\nand we also going to insert a new line\nand we also going to insert a new line so that that line is done and we are\nso that that line is done and we are\nso that that line is done and we are we'll be at the next line else return.\nwe'll be at the next line else return.\nwe'll be at the next line else return. So there's always a possibility that the\nSo there's always a possibility that the\nSo there's always a possibility that the line number is not in the range of\nline number is not in the range of\nline number is not in the range of possible line numbers. So we have to\npossible line numbers. So we have to\npossible line numbers. So we have to make sure that we catch that scenario.\nmake sure that we catch that scenario.\nmake sure that we catch that scenario. So with open file name in write mode as\nSo with open file name in write mode as\nSo with open file name in write mode as file file dot write lines. So and we\nfile file dot write lines. So and we\nfile file dot write lines. So and we will just write the lines and then we're\nwill just write the lines and then we're\nwill just write the lines and then we're going to say document edited and saved\ngoing to say document edited and saved\ngoing to say document edited and saved to the file and we are done here. So\nto the file and we are done here. So\nto the file and we are done here. So basically that's editing the document.\nbasically that's editing the document.\nbasically that's editing the document. So just by fixing some inputs that ran\nSo just by fixing some inputs that ran\nSo just by fixing some inputs that ran fine. So this code doesn't have any\nfine. So this code doesn't have any\nfine. So this code doesn't have any syntax errors. So let's define the\nsyntax errors. So let's define the\nsyntax errors. So let's define the supervisor. Now for implementing the\nsupervisor. Now for implementing the\nsupervisor. Now for implementing the supervisor we're going to make it a\nsupervisor we're going to make it a\nsupervisor we're going to make it a general purpose one because you you know\ngeneral purpose one because you you know\ngeneral purpose one because you you know we can look at this one as you know one\nwe can look at this one as you know one\nwe can look at this one as you know one node on the top and then two nodes that\nnode on the top and then two nodes that\nnode on the top and then two nodes that are reporting to it. Now similarly\nare reporting to it. Now similarly\nare reporting to it. Now similarly inside this research agent team we will\ninside this research agent team we will\ninside this research agent team we will have one supervisor like this and we\nhave one supervisor like this and we\nhave one supervisor like this and we will have two nodes inside that doing\nwill have two nodes inside that doing\nwill have two nodes inside that doing different things. Same goes with writing\ndifferent things. Same goes with writing\ndifferent things. Same goes with writing agent team we will have a supervisor\nagent team we will have a supervisor\nagent team we will have a supervisor again under that we will have different\nagain under that we will have different\nagain under that we will have different agents that are using these tools. So it\nagents that are using these tools. So it\nagents that are using these tools. So it only makes sense if we have a general\nonly makes sense if we have a general\nonly makes sense if we have a general purpose function that actually can have\npurpose function that actually can have\npurpose function that actually can have supervisor at the top and then different\nsupervisor at the top and then different\nsupervisor at the top and then different reporting members if you like which\nreporting members if you like which\nreporting members if you like which together form a big team. In this case\ntogether form a big team. In this case\ntogether form a big team. In this case we have this team this team and with\nwe have this team this team and with\nwe have this team this team and with this supervisor we have this big team.\nthis supervisor we have this big team.\nthis supervisor we have this big team. This is exactly what we will implement\nThis is exactly what we will implement\nThis is exactly what we will implement as a general purpose function. So let's\nas a general purpose function. So let's\nas a general purpose function. So let's go ahead and do that. So supervisor\ngo ahead and do that. So supervisor\ngo ahead and do that. So supervisor is going to take a state of course which\nis going to take a state of course which\nis going to take a state of course which is the messages state. So we will have\nis the messages state. So we will have\nis the messages state. So we will have to define the messages state which is\nto define the messages state which is\nto define the messages state which is going to be messages state and it's\ngoing to be messages state and it's\ngoing to be messages state and it's nothing but the next one. Basically the\nnothing but the next one. Basically the\nnothing but the next one. Basically the state is going to be the next node that\nstate is going to be the next node that\nstate is going to be the next node that is going to be handed over to. So it\nis going to be handed over to. So it\nis going to be handed over to. So it takes as input the state and it's going\ntakes as input the state and it's going\ntakes as input the state and it's going to return a command. I I'll get to you\nto return a command. I I'll get to you\nto return a command. I I'll get to you what the command is. So a command of\nwhat the command is. So a command of\nwhat the command is. So a command of literal which is going to be the members\nliteral which is going to be the members\nliteral which is going to be the members or it could be the end and the message\nor it could be the end and the message\nor it could be the end and the message is is that of role is system and the\nis is that of role is system and the\nis is that of role is system and the content is system prompt. So basically\ncontent is system prompt. So basically\ncontent is system prompt. So basically it's going to take the system prompt and\nit's going to take the system prompt and\nit's going to take the system prompt and it's also going to take the messages\nit's also going to take the messages\nit's also going to take the messages from the state and what it's going to do\nfrom the state and what it's going to do\nfrom the state and what it's going to do is is going to use a LLM but the LLM is\nis is going to use a LLM but the LLM is\nis is going to use a LLM but the LLM is going to give a structured output\ngoing to give a structured output\ngoing to give a structured output basically going to tell us which one to\nbasically going to tell us which one to\nbasically going to tell us which one to switch to. As we can see this is the\nswitch to. As we can see this is the\nswitch to. As we can see this is the supervisor agent we are implementing and\nsupervisor agent we are implementing and\nsupervisor agent we are implementing and all that it has to decide is go to this\nall that it has to decide is go to this\nall that it has to decide is go to this one or go to this one or go to end. So\none or go to this one or go to end. So\none or go to this one or go to end. So it's much easier if it's a structured\nit's much easier if it's a structured\nit's much easier if it's a structured output rather than a long textual\noutput rather than a long textual\noutput rather than a long textual output. So that's what we're trying to\noutput. So that's what we're trying to\noutput. So that's what we're trying to do. We're going to say with structured\ndo. We're going to say with structured\ndo. We're going to say with structured output and we need to define the\noutput and we need to define the\noutput and we need to define the structured output which is the router\nstructured output which is the router\nstructured output which is the router and we're going to invoke it with the\nand we're going to invoke it with the\nand we're going to invoke it with the messages. So hope that is clear. So we\nmessages. So hope that is clear. So we\nmessages. So hope that is clear. So we now need to define this router. So I'm\nnow need to define this router. So I'm\nnow need to define this router. So I'm just going to define the router class\njust going to define the router class\njust going to define the router class router is a type dig which is going to\nrouter is a type dig which is going to\nrouter is a type dig which is going to say what is the next one and it's going\nsay what is the next one and it's going\nsay what is the next one and it's going to be from the options. So once we get\nto be from the options. So once we get\nto be from the options. So once we get the response we need to define go to. So\nthe response we need to define go to. So\nthe response we need to define go to. So where we need to go to which is the\nwhere we need to go to which is the\nwhere we need to go to which is the response of next whatever is there in\nresponse of next whatever is there in\nresponse of next whatever is there in the next we are going to decide based on\nthe next we are going to decide based on\nthe next we are going to decide based on that is the the node that we're going to\nthat is the the node that we're going to\nthat is the the node that we're going to and if the go to is finish that means we\nand if the go to is finish that means we\nand if the go to is finish that means we are going to go to the end. So go to is\nare going to go to the end. So go to is\nare going to go to the end. So go to is end and we're going to return command\nend and we're going to return command\nend and we're going to return command date is go to. So you may be wondering\ndate is go to. So you may be wondering\ndate is go to. So you may be wondering why we are basically using this command\nwhy we are basically using this command\nwhy we are basically using this command and all this kind of things. So in order\nand all this kind of things. So in order\nand all this kind of things. So in order to find out why this command is used,\nto find out why this command is used,\nto find out why this command is used, let's get to the documentation of\nlet's get to the documentation of\nlet's get to the documentation of langraph where it says you know there's\nlangraph where it says you know there's\nlangraph where it says you know there's a idea called handoff and handoff is\na idea called handoff and handoff is\na idea called handoff and handoff is where one agent hands off control to\nwhere one agent hands off control to\nwhere one agent hands off control to another and handoff allows you to\nanother and handoff allows you to\nanother and handoff allows you to specify the destination the target agent\nspecify the destination the target agent\nspecify the destination the target agent to navigate to and the payload which is\nto navigate to and the payload which is\nto navigate to and the payload which is nothing but the information to pass to\nnothing but the information to pass to\nnothing but the information to pass to that agent. And how do we implement\nthat agent. And how do we implement\nthat agent. And how do we implement handoff in langraph? that is by using\nhandoff in langraph? that is by using\nhandoff in langraph? that is by using the command object. So we need to create\nthe command object. So we need to create\nthe command object. So we need to create a command object. They've given an\na command object. They've given an\na command object. They've given an example here. In this case, the agent is\nexample here. In this case, the agent is\nexample here. In this case, the agent is has the option to switch to itself which\nhas the option to switch to itself which\nhas the option to switch to itself which is agent or to another agent. And how\nis agent or to another agent. And how\nis agent or to another agent. And how does it do that? It needs to have a go\ndoes it do that? It needs to have a go\ndoes it do that? It needs to have a go to could be agent or another agent. And\nto could be agent or another agent. And\nto could be agent or another agent. And we need to specify go to in command. and\nwe need to specify go to in command. and\nwe need to specify go to in command. and and we also need to update the graph\nand we also need to update the graph\nand we also need to update the graph state which is the you know the memory\nstate which is the you know the memory\nstate which is the you know the memory and we need to give update equal to my\nand we need to give update equal to my\nand we need to give update equal to my state key and my state value. We're\nstate key and my state value. We're\nstate key and my state value. We're basically updating the state here. So\nbasically updating the state here. So\nbasically updating the state here. So this is a way to hand over control from\nthis is a way to hand over control from\nthis is a way to hand over control from one agent to another and that's what\none agent to another and that's what\none agent to another and that's what precisely we are trying to do. We are\nprecisely we are trying to do. We are\nprecisely we are trying to do. We are using the command and we are saying go\nusing the command and we are saying go\nusing the command and we are saying go to this with this payload and the\nto this with this payload and the\nto this with this payload and the options for that are you know the finish\noptions for that are you know the finish\noptions for that are you know the finish or the members and the members are going\nor the members and the members are going\nor the members and the members are going to be that of the research agent team or\nto be that of the research agent team or\nto be that of the research agent team or the writing agent team and that's\nthe writing agent team and that's\nthe writing agent team and that's decided by the supervisor. So these are\ndecided by the supervisor. So these are\ndecided by the supervisor. So these are the two members it goes to either this\nthe two members it goes to either this\nthe two members it goes to either this one or this one or it goes to end. Now\none or this one or it goes to end. Now\none or this one or it goes to end. Now we define the router, we define the\nwe define the router, we define the\nwe define the router, we define the supervisor and we need to define a\nsupervisor and we need to define a\nsupervisor and we need to define a wrapper node. So let's say make\nwrapper node. So let's say make\nwrapper node. So let's say make supervisor node and it's going to be an\nsupervisor node and it's going to be an\nsupervisor node and it's going to be an LLM is going to be one of the inputs\nLLM is going to be one of the inputs\nLLM is going to be one of the inputs which is going to be base chat model and\nwhich is going to be base chat model and\nwhich is going to be base chat model and we're also going to have members which\nwe're also going to have members which\nwe're also going to have members which are the different agents that it can\nare the different agents that it can\nare the different agents that it can route to. So this is going to be a list\nroute to. So this is going to be a list\nroute to. So this is going to be a list of string and it's going to return a\nof string and it's going to return a\nof string and it's going to return a string to and we're going to say the\nstring to and we're going to say the\nstring to and we're going to say the options. The options is that of finish.\noptions. The options is that of finish.\noptions. The options is that of finish. It can go to the end or it can have it\nIt can go to the end or it can have it\nIt can go to the end or it can have it can go to one of the members. And the\ncan go to one of the members. And the\ncan go to one of the members. And the system prompt is that of you are a\nsystem prompt is that of you are a\nsystem prompt is that of you are a supervisor tasked with managing. So that\nsupervisor tasked with managing. So that\nsupervisor tasked with managing. So that is the system prompt we are giving. You\nis the system prompt we are giving. You\nis the system prompt we are giving. You are a supervisor tasked with managing a\nare a supervisor tasked with managing a\nare a supervisor tasked with managing a conversation between the following\nconversation between the following\nconversation between the following workers which are the members. Given the\nworkers which are the members. Given the\nworkers which are the members. Given the following user request, respond with the\nfollowing user request, respond with the\nfollowing user request, respond with the worker to act next. Each worker will\nworker to act next. Each worker will\nworker to act next. Each worker will perform a task and respond with their\nperform a task and respond with their\nperform a task and respond with their result and status. When finished,\nresult and status. When finished,\nresult and status. When finished, respond with finish. So that's precisely\nrespond with finish. So that's precisely\nrespond with finish. So that's precisely what we wanted to do. So with that\nwhat we wanted to do. So with that\nwhat we wanted to do. So with that system prompt and options, we have made\nsystem prompt and options, we have made\nsystem prompt and options, we have made the supervisor node. One more thing is\nthe supervisor node. One more thing is\nthe supervisor node. One more thing is that this router and the supervisor are\nthat this router and the supervisor are\nthat this router and the supervisor are part of this function. So whenever we\npart of this function. So whenever we\npart of this function. So whenever we want to create a supervisor, we will now\nwant to create a supervisor, we will now\nwant to create a supervisor, we will now invoke this make supervisor node rather\ninvoke this make supervisor node rather\ninvoke this make supervisor node rather than directly using this supervisor\nthan directly using this supervisor\nthan directly using this supervisor function. So now that we have defined\nfunction. So now that we have defined\nfunction. So now that we have defined the supervisor, we can move on to\nthe supervisor, we can move on to\nthe supervisor, we can move on to research team agent. So for the research\nresearch team agent. So for the research\nresearch team agent. So for the research team agent, we will be using an LLM\nteam agent, we will be using an LLM\nteam agent, we will be using an LLM which is going to be chat open AI with\nwhich is going to be chat open AI with\nwhich is going to be chat open AI with the model say GPT40.\nthe model say GPT40.\nthe model say GPT40. So chat openai is not defined. I'm going\nSo chat openai is not defined. I'm going\nSo chat openai is not defined. I'm going to define it here in the imports from\nto define it here in the imports from\nto define it here in the imports from lang chain openai. Import chat openai.\nlang chain openai. Import chat openai.\nlang chain openai. Import chat openai. Right, we need to install lang chain\nRight, we need to install lang chain\nRight, we need to install lang chain openai. So we have installed it now and\nopenai. So we have installed it now and\nopenai. So we have installed it now and we have now imported chat open AI. So we\nwe have now imported chat open AI. So we\nwe have now imported chat open AI. So we should be able to create a GPT4\nshould be able to create a GPT4\nshould be able to create a GPT4 model based LLM. So the researcher agent\nmodel based LLM. So the researcher agent\nmodel based LLM. So the researcher agent is going to have a web scrapper node.\nis going to have a web scrapper node.\nis going to have a web scrapper node. Probably it will also have a search node\nProbably it will also have a search node\nProbably it will also have a search node in order to do a web search. So let's go\nin order to do a web search. So let's go\nin order to do a web search. So let's go ahead and implement that. Define search\nahead and implement that. Define search\nahead and implement that. Define search node which is going to have take the\nnode which is going to have take the\nnode which is going to have take the state and it's going to return command\nstate and it's going to return command\nstate and it's going to return command of literal supervisor. Basically it\nof literal supervisor. Basically it\nof literal supervisor. Basically it needs to route itself to the supervisor\nneeds to route itself to the supervisor\nneeds to route itself to the supervisor node. The result is search agent dot\nnode. The result is search agent dot\nnode. The result is search agent dot invoke and we will pass the state and we\ninvoke and we will pass the state and we\ninvoke and we will pass the state and we are going to return the command which is\nare going to return the command which is\nare going to return the command which is going to have update messages is human\ngoing to have update messages is human\ngoing to have update messages is human message of content result of messages\nmessage of content result of messages\nmessage of content result of messages minus one dot content name is search and\nminus one dot content name is search and\nminus one dot content name is search and go to is supervisor. So one thing to\ngo to is supervisor. So one thing to\ngo to is supervisor. So one thing to note is that whenever we give something\nnote is that whenever we give something\nnote is that whenever we give something in go to we also need to make sure that\nin go to we also need to make sure that\nin go to we also need to make sure that we have it have the same literal here\nwe have it have the same literal here\nwe have it have the same literal here otherwise it's going to error out. So\notherwise it's going to error out. So\notherwise it's going to error out. So that's the search node and we also need\nthat's the search node and we also need\nthat's the search node and we also need to define the web scraper node which is\nto define the web scraper node which is\nto define the web scraper node which is going to again take the state and is\ngoing to again take the state and is\ngoing to again take the state and is going to return a command of literal\ngoing to return a command of literal\ngoing to return a command of literal supervisor again result is the web\nsupervisor again result is the web\nsupervisor again result is the web scraper agent invoke. So we haven't\nscraper agent invoke. So we haven't\nscraper agent invoke. So we haven't created this web scraper agent but we\ncreated this web scraper agent but we\ncreated this web scraper agent but we can readily create a react agent using\ncan readily create a react agent using\ncan readily create a react agent using the create react agent function which is\nthe create react agent function which is\nthe create react agent function which is provided by lang graph itself. So if we\nprovided by lang graph itself. So if we\nprovided by lang graph itself. So if we import that from lang graph let's say if\nimport that from lang graph let's say if\nimport that from lang graph let's say if I come back here so from from lang graph\nI come back here so from from lang graph\nI come back here so from from lang graph dot pre-built import create react agent.\ndot pre-built import create react agent.\ndot pre-built import create react agent. So we can readily create a react agent.\nSo we can readily create a react agent.\nSo we can readily create a react agent. But if you want to find out how we can\nBut if you want to find out how we can\nBut if you want to find out how we can implement a react agent, we have a\nimplement a react agent, we have a\nimplement a react agent, we have a separate video on that. I've I've shown\nseparate video on that. I've I've shown\nseparate video on that. I've I've shown you end to end how we can go about\nyou end to end how we can go about\nyou end to end how we can go about implementing a react agent. But that's\nimplementing a react agent. But that's\nimplementing a react agent. But that's not the goal here. We saying that the\nnot the goal here. We saying that the\nnot the goal here. We saying that the web scripper agent is a React agent and\nweb scripper agent is a React agent and\nweb scripper agent is a React agent and we are going to pass LLM to it because\nwe are going to pass LLM to it because\nwe are going to pass LLM to it because the agent needs to be a wraparound lm.\nthe agent needs to be a wraparound lm.\nthe agent needs to be a wraparound lm. So I'm going to say llm and I'm going to\nSo I'm going to say llm and I'm going to\nSo I'm going to say llm and I'm going to say tools is that of the scrape web\nsay tools is that of the scrape web\nsay tools is that of the scrape web pages. So that's the tool that it will\npages. So that's the tool that it will\npages. So that's the tool that it will use. By the way, we've given a search\nuse. By the way, we've given a search\nuse. By the way, we've given a search agent here. So that needs to be using an\nagent here. So that needs to be using an\nagent here. So that needs to be using an LLM as well. And we need to create that\nLLM as well. And we need to create that\nLLM as well. And we need to create that agent. So we we can also say create\nagent. So we we can also say create\nagent. So we we can also say create react agent using the LLM and the tools\nreact agent using the LLM and the tools\nreact agent using the LLM and the tools is that of Tavili tools the Tavili\nis that of Tavili tools the Tavili\nis that of Tavili tools the Tavili Tavili tool. So we created the search\nTavili tool. So we created the search\nTavili tool. So we created the search agent, we created the web agent and we\nagent, we created the web agent and we\nagent, we created the web agent and we created a search node using the search\ncreated a search node using the search\ncreated a search node using the search agent. Now we are creating the web\nagent. Now we are creating the web\nagent. Now we are creating the web scraper node using the web scraper\nscraper node using the web scraper\nscraper node using the web scraper agent. So the result is invoke and the\nagent. So the result is invoke and the\nagent. So the result is invoke and the just for time sake I'm just going to\njust for time sake I'm just going to\njust for time sake I'm just going to copy this and paste it. So this going to\ncopy this and paste it. So this going to\ncopy this and paste it. So this going to copy this paste it here and command of\ncopy this paste it here and command of\ncopy this paste it here and command of human message messages and instead of\nhuman message messages and instead of\nhuman message messages and instead of the name I'm going to say web scraper\nthe name I'm going to say web scraper\nthe name I'm going to say web scraper and we'll go to supervisor again and\nand we'll go to supervisor again and\nand we'll go to supervisor again and we're going to say research supervisor\nwe're going to say research supervisor\nwe're going to say research supervisor node is make supervisor node of llm and\nnode is make supervisor node of llm and\nnode is make supervisor node of llm and we're going to search and web scraper\nwe're going to search and web scraper\nwe're going to search and web scraper node function that we just implemented\nnode function that we just implemented\nnode function that we just implemented before. So one more thing is that the\nbefore. So one more thing is that the\nbefore. So one more thing is that the tavi tool is not defined. So let's\ntavi tool is not defined. So let's\ntavi tool is not defined. So let's define it here. Tavili tool is equal to\ndefine it here. Tavili tool is equal to\ndefine it here. Tavili tool is equal to tavi search of max results is let's say\ntavi search of max results is let's say\ntavi search of max results is let's say three. And we haven't imported this tavi\nthree. And we haven't imported this tavi\nthree. And we haven't imported this tavi search. We need to import it from lang\nsearch. We need to import it from lang\nsearch. We need to import it from lang chain tavi. So we will say from lang\nchain tavi. So we will say from lang\nchain tavi. So we will say from lang chain tavi import tabi search. So that\nchain tavi import tabi search. So that\nchain tavi import tabi search. So that seems to have imported fine. State is\nseems to have imported fine. State is\nseems to have imported fine. State is not defined. So we need to import a few\nnot defined. So we need to import a few\nnot defined. So we need to import a few things from lang graph itself. So from\nthings from lang graph itself. So from\nthings from lang graph itself. So from lang graph graph import state graph\nlang graph graph import state graph\nlang graph graph import state graph message state start and end and we also\nmessage state start and end and we also\nmessage state start and end and we also need to import command. So from lang\nneed to import command. So from lang\nneed to import command. So from lang graph dot types import command fixing\ngraph dot types import command fixing\ngraph dot types import command fixing some typos and some import. So that has\nsome typos and some import. So that has\nsome typos and some import. So that has run fine. So this code is fine except\nrun fine. So this code is fine except\nrun fine. So this code is fine except for some warnings. We can now move on to\nfor some warnings. We can now move on to\nfor some warnings. We can now move on to the writing team. So before we move on\nthe writing team. So before we move on\nthe writing team. So before we move on to the writing team, we need to make\nto the writing team, we need to make\nto the writing team, we need to make sure that this research team works fine.\nsure that this research team works fine.\nsure that this research team works fine. So let's test it out by just adding a\nSo let's test it out by just adding a\nSo let's test it out by just adding a cell. And in the cell, we just try to\ncell. And in the cell, we just try to\ncell. And in the cell, we just try to run it. So research builder is the is\nrun it. So research builder is the is\nrun it. So research builder is the is the state graph state. We're basically\nthe state graph state. We're basically\nthe state graph state. We're basically going to compile. We're going to be\ngoing to compile. We're going to be\ngoing to compile. We're going to be basically going to add nodes and we're\nbasically going to add nodes and we're\nbasically going to add nodes and we're going to compile it and make sure it\ngoing to compile it and make sure it\ngoing to compile it and make sure it runs. So add node of the supervisor\nruns. So add node of the supervisor\nruns. So add node of the supervisor research supervisor node again research\nresearch supervisor node again research\nresearch supervisor node again research builder again research builder dot add\nbuilder again research builder dot add\nbuilder again research builder dot add node of the uh search node which is\nnode of the uh search node which is\nnode of the uh search node which is going to be the search node again\ngoing to be the search node again\ngoing to be the search node again research builder dot add node of the web\nresearch builder dot add node of the web\nresearch builder dot add node of the web scraper it's going to be web scraper\nscraper it's going to be web scraper\nscraper it's going to be web scraper node research builder dot add edge so\nnode research builder dot add edge so\nnode research builder dot add edge so we're going to go from start to the\nwe're going to go from start to the\nwe're going to go from start to the supervisor And the supervisor going to\nsupervisor And the supervisor going to\nsupervisor And the supervisor going to is going to take care of routing from\nis going to take care of routing from\nis going to take care of routing from there on. So we're just going to say\nthere on. So we're just going to say\nthere on. So we're just going to say research research graph is the compiled\nresearch research graph is the compiled\nresearch research graph is the compiled version of the research builder. So we\nversion of the research builder. So we\nversion of the research builder. So we compile it and format. Now let's move on\ncompile it and format. Now let's move on\ncompile it and format. Now let's move on to the writing agent or the writing\nto the writing agent or the writing\nto the writing agent or the writing team. So if you look at the um\nteam. So if you look at the um\nteam. So if you look at the um architecture we've got here. So we have\narchitecture we've got here. So we have\narchitecture we've got here. So we have implemented the research agent team. Now\nimplemented the research agent team. Now\nimplemented the research agent team. Now we are moving on to writing agent team.\nwe are moving on to writing agent team.\nwe are moving on to writing agent team. As we will see it uses the writer,\nAs we will see it uses the writer,\nAs we will see it uses the writer, noteaker and chart generator. So we will\nnoteaker and chart generator. So we will\nnoteaker and chart generator. So we will make sure that these tools are available\nmake sure that these tools are available\nmake sure that these tools are available for the writing team agent available for\nfor the writing team agent available for\nfor the writing team agent available for the writing agent team. So let's\nthe writing agent team. So let's\nthe writing agent team. So let's continue. So first we need the doc\ncontinue. So first we need the doc\ncontinue. So first we need the doc writer agent which we need to we are\nwriter agent which we need to we are\nwriter agent which we need to we are going to use create react agent for it\ngoing to use create react agent for it\ngoing to use create react agent for it and we're going to provide the llm and\nand we're going to provide the llm and\nand we're going to provide the llm and the tools are going to be that of write\nthe tools are going to be that of write\nthe tools are going to be that of write document that we created before edit\ndocument that we created before edit\ndocument that we created before edit document. So it should be able to edit\ndocument. So it should be able to edit\ndocument. So it should be able to edit document and it should be able to read\ndocument and it should be able to read\ndocument and it should be able to read documents of course. And the prompt\ndocuments of course. And the prompt\ndocuments of course. And the prompt we're going to use is that of this which\nwe're going to use is that of this which\nwe're going to use is that of this which is you can read, write and edit\nis you can read, write and edit\nis you can read, write and edit documents based on note takers outlines.\ndocuments based on note takers outlines.\ndocuments based on note takers outlines. Don't ask follow-up questions. So with\nDon't ask follow-up questions. So with\nDon't ask follow-up questions. So with that instruction it should be able to\nthat instruction it should be able to\nthat instruction it should be able to the dock writing agent should be able to\nthe dock writing agent should be able to\nthe dock writing agent should be able to write a document and then we define doc\nwrite a document and then we define doc\nwrite a document and then we define doc writing node. In order to wrap up this\nwriting node. In order to wrap up this\nwriting node. In order to wrap up this doc writing agent in a node we need to\ndoc writing agent in a node we need to\ndoc writing agent in a node we need to create a node which obviously takes a\ncreate a node which obviously takes a\ncreate a node which obviously takes a state and we need the command obviously\nstate and we need the command obviously\nstate and we need the command obviously to say what is returned. Basically that\nto say what is returned. Basically that\nto say what is returned. Basically that is the supervisor which means that the\nis the supervisor which means that the\nis the supervisor which means that the control flows from this one to the\ncontrol flows from this one to the\ncontrol flows from this one to the supervisor and we will drag the result\nsupervisor and we will drag the result\nsupervisor and we will drag the result as doc writer agent dot invoke and we\nas doc writer agent dot invoke and we\nas doc writer agent dot invoke and we pass the state and we need to return the\npass the state and we need to return the\npass the state and we need to return the command of update is the messages is\ncommand of update is the messages is\ncommand of update is the messages is human message content is result of\nhuman message content is result of\nhuman message content is result of messages last message dot content and\nmessages last message dot content and\nmessages last message dot content and the name is doc writer. So that's update\nthe name is doc writer. So that's update\nthe name is doc writer. So that's update and we also need go to to which is the\nand we also need go to to which is the\nand we also need go to to which is the uh agent that we need to go to from\nuh agent that we need to go to from\nuh agent that we need to go to from here. So which is going to be the\nhere. So which is going to be the\nhere. So which is going to be the supervisor. So once we are done with\nsupervisor. So once we are done with\nsupervisor. So once we are done with these two we're done with the document\nthese two we're done with the document\nthese two we're done with the document write node. So this agent is now wrapped\nwrite node. So this agent is now wrapped\nwrite node. So this agent is now wrapped up with this write node document writing\nup with this write node document writing\nup with this write node document writing node. Similarly, we need the note\nnode. Similarly, we need the note\nnode. Similarly, we need the note takingaking agent going which is going\ntakingaking agent going which is going\ntakingaking agent going which is going to be created using create react agent\nto be created using create react agent\nto be created using create react agent of course and we're going to be creating\nof course and we're going to be creating\nof course and we're going to be creating with the LLM at its heart and the tools\nwith the LLM at its heart and the tools\nwith the LLM at its heart and the tools we are going to be using is that of\nwe are going to be using is that of\nwe are going to be using is that of create outline and it's going to read\ncreate outline and it's going to read\ncreate outline and it's going to read documents as well. So that's the tools\ndocuments as well. So that's the tools\ndocuments as well. So that's the tools that it's going to use. And the prompt\nthat it's going to use. And the prompt\nthat it's going to use. And the prompt is going to be you can read documents\nis going to be you can read documents\nis going to be you can read documents and create outlines for the document\nand create outlines for the document\nand create outlines for the document writer. Don't ask followup questions. We\nwriter. Don't ask followup questions. We\nwriter. Don't ask followup questions. We don't want it to go in loop. So we are\ndon't want it to go in loop. So we are\ndon't want it to go in loop. So we are saying don't ask follow-up questions.\nsaying don't ask follow-up questions.\nsaying don't ask follow-up questions. And once we have created the note\nAnd once we have created the note\nAnd once we have created the note takingaking agent, obviously we need to\ntakingaking agent, obviously we need to\ntakingaking agent, obviously we need to wrap it in a node. So note takingaking\nwrap it in a node. So note takingaking\nwrap it in a node. So note takingaking node and the node needs the state of\nnode and the node needs the state of\nnode and the node needs the state of course and we're going to be returning\ncourse and we're going to be returning\ncourse and we're going to be returning the command of literal supervisor and\nthe command of literal supervisor and\nthe command of literal supervisor and the result is going to be I'm just going\nthe result is going to be I'm just going\nthe result is going to be I'm just going to copy this one and paste it here and\nto copy this one and paste it here and\nto copy this one and paste it here and make sure we change the right things\nmake sure we change the right things\nmake sure we change the right things here. So instead of the doc writing\nhere. So instead of the doc writing\nhere. So instead of the doc writing writer agent, it's going to be note\nwriter agent, it's going to be note\nwriter agent, it's going to be note takingaking agent and the command is\ntakingaking agent and the command is\ntakingaking agent and the command is going to be that of the human message\ngoing to be that of the human message\ngoing to be that of the human message blah blah blah. But the name is going to\nblah blah blah. But the name is going to\nblah blah blah. But the name is going to be that of note taker and the goto is\nbe that of note taker and the goto is\nbe that of note taker and the goto is again going to be the supervisor.\nagain going to be the supervisor.\nagain going to be the supervisor. Similarly now we can create a chart\nSimilarly now we can create a chart\nSimilarly now we can create a chart agent chart generating agent create\nagent chart generating agent create\nagent chart generating agent create react agent. This is going to be\nreact agent. This is going to be\nreact agent. This is going to be slightly tricky. I'll come to it why. So\nslightly tricky. I'll come to it why. So\nslightly tricky. I'll come to it why. So the llm is going to be there and the\nthe llm is going to be there and the\nthe llm is going to be there and the tools is going to be that of read\ntools is going to be that of read\ntools is going to be that of read document and we also need a python\ndocument and we also need a python\ndocument and we also need a python ripple python ripple tool. So this is\nripple python ripple tool. So this is\nripple python ripple tool. So this is special because in order to create a\nspecial because in order to create a\nspecial because in order to create a chart the agent should basically run\nchart the agent should basically run\nchart the agent should basically run some python code for example say do some\nsome python code for example say do some\nsome python code for example say do some mattplot lib in python it needs to use\nmattplot lib in python it needs to use\nmattplot lib in python it needs to use the mattplot lib or any other similar\nthe mattplot lib or any other similar\nthe mattplot lib or any other similar library in order to create a plot or any\nlibrary in order to create a plot or any\nlibrary in order to create a plot or any chart for example. So, we need to make\nchart for example. So, we need to make\nchart for example. So, we need to make sure we implement this Python ripple.\nsure we implement this Python ripple.\nsure we implement this Python ripple. I'm going to So, once we complete this,\nI'm going to So, once we complete this,\nI'm going to So, once we complete this, I'm going to go back and implement this\nI'm going to go back and implement this\nI'm going to go back and implement this Python ripple tool. But for now, let's\nPython ripple tool. But for now, let's\nPython ripple tool. But for now, let's go ahead and we're going to create a\ngo ahead and we're going to create a\ngo ahead and we're going to create a chart generation node. I'm just going to\nchart generation node. I'm just going to\nchart generation node. I'm just going to copy this one, the copy the note\ncopy this one, the copy the note\ncopy this one, the copy the note takingaking node and I'm going to change\ntakingaking node and I'm going to change\ntakingaking node and I'm going to change this to chart generating node. And the\nthis to chart generating node. And the\nthis to chart generating node. And the state is going to be the same. It's\nstate is going to be the same. It's\nstate is going to be the same. It's going to go back to the supervisor and\ngoing to go back to the supervisor and\ngoing to go back to the supervisor and the instead of note takingaking agent,\nthe instead of note takingaking agent,\nthe instead of note takingaking agent, it's going to be chart generating agent.\nit's going to be chart generating agent.\nit's going to be chart generating agent. And the command is pretty much the same,\nAnd the command is pretty much the same,\nAnd the command is pretty much the same, but instead of note taker, it's going to\nbut instead of note taker, it's going to\nbut instead of note taker, it's going to be chart generator. And we're going to\nbe chart generator. And we're going to\nbe chart generator. And we're going to return the supervisor to here. And we're\nreturn the supervisor to here. And we're\nreturn the supervisor to here. And we're going to reuse the make supervisor node.\ngoing to reuse the make supervisor node.\ngoing to reuse the make supervisor node. So let's dock writing supervisor node is\nSo let's dock writing supervisor node is\nSo let's dock writing supervisor node is going to be created using make\ngoing to be created using make\ngoing to be created using make supervisor node and the inputs are going\nsupervisor node and the inputs are going\nsupervisor node and the inputs are going to be the llm. So it's going to be dock\nto be the llm. So it's going to be dock\nto be the llm. So it's going to be dock writer node taker and chart generator.\nwriter node taker and chart generator.\nwriter node taker and chart generator. So that's pretty much it. That will\nSo that's pretty much it. That will\nSo that's pretty much it. That will create the dock writing supervisor node.\ncreate the dock writing supervisor node.\ncreate the dock writing supervisor node. But then remember we now have to\nBut then remember we now have to\nBut then remember we now have to implement this python ripple tool. So\nimplement this python ripple tool. So\nimplement this python ripple tool. So let's go ahead and implement that. I'm\nlet's go ahead and implement that. I'm\nlet's go ahead and implement that. I'm going to scroll up to where we actually\ngoing to scroll up to where we actually\ngoing to scroll up to where we actually have the different tools. So I'm going\nhave the different tools. So I'm going\nhave the different tools. So I'm going to scroll all the way up and we have set\nto scroll all the way up and we have set\nto scroll all the way up and we have set of functions here which are define all\nof functions here which are define all\nof functions here which are define all the tools. For example, we define the\nthe tools. For example, we define the\nthe tools. For example, we define the right document, read document, edit\nright document, read document, edit\nright document, read document, edit document. And here I'm just going to\ndocument. And here I'm just going to\ndocument. And here I'm just going to create one more tool. I'm just going to\ncreate one more tool. I'm just going to\ncreate one more tool. I'm just going to call it I'm just going to call it Python\ncall it I'm just going to call it Python\ncall it I'm just going to call it Python ripple tool and it's going to be a tool\nripple tool and it's going to be a tool\nripple tool and it's going to be a tool and the input parameters are code of\nand the input parameters are code of\nand the input parameters are code of course string and the Python code to\ncourse string and the Python code to\ncourse string and the Python code to execute to generate your chart. So we're\nexecute to generate your chart. So we're\nexecute to generate your chart. So we're going to close that and this is going to\ngoing to close that and this is going to\ngoing to close that and this is going to we obviously need the dock string now\nwe obviously need the dock string now\nwe obviously need the dock string now because this is a tool. Use this to\nbecause this is a tool. Use this to\nbecause this is a tool. Use this to execute Python code. If you want to see\nexecute Python code. If you want to see\nexecute Python code. If you want to see the output of any value, you should\nthe output of any value, you should\nthe output of any value, you should print it with print. This is visible to\nprint it with print. This is visible to\nprint it with print. This is visible to the user and let's close the dock string\nthe user and let's close the dock string\nthe user and let's close the dock string and let's implement it. So basically we\nand let's implement it. So basically we\nand let's implement it. So basically we need to try the result because it's\nneed to try the result because it's\nneed to try the result because it's going to be ripple run code if we have\ngoing to be ripple run code if we have\ngoing to be ripple run code if we have any exceptions base exception as e\nany exceptions base exception as e\nany exceptions base exception as e except return going to return a f string\nexcept return going to return a f string\nexcept return going to return a f string which says file to execute and we're\nwhich says file to execute and we're\nwhich says file to execute and we're going to give error as to what failed\ngoing to give error as to what failed\ngoing to give error as to what failed actually so IPR of e and we're going to\nactually so IPR of e and we're going to\nactually so IPR of e and we're going to return we don't go into exception\nreturn we don't go into exception\nreturn we don't go into exception obviously we need to return successfully\nobviously we need to return successfully\nobviously we need to return successfully executed the code. We're going to put it\nexecuted the code. We're going to put it\nexecuted the code. We're going to put it in a new line so that it's nicely\nin a new line so that it's nicely\nin a new line so that it's nicely readable. It's going to say Python again\nreadable. It's going to say Python again\nreadable. It's going to say Python again new line and the code and we're also\nnew line and the code and we're also\nnew line and the code and we're also going to have a result. We're also going\ngoing to have a result. We're also going\ngoing to have a result. We're also going to print the result. So let's go to a\nto print the result. So let's go to a\nto print the result. So let's go to a new line and say send it out of result.\nnew line and say send it out of result.\nnew line and say send it out of result. So that's pretty much it for the Python\nSo that's pretty much it for the Python\nSo that's pretty much it for the Python ripple tool we have. So that seems to\nripple tool we have. So that seems to\nripple tool we have. So that seems to run fine. So we have defined the Python\nrun fine. So we have defined the Python\nrun fine. So we have defined the Python ripple tool as well. Now we should be\nripple tool as well. Now we should be\nripple tool as well. Now we should be able to create the entire writing team.\nable to create the entire writing team.\nable to create the entire writing team. So I'm just going to run this one.\nSo I'm just going to run this one.\nSo I'm just going to run this one. Closing parenthesis. So I'm going to\nClosing parenthesis. So I'm going to\nClosing parenthesis. So I'm going to debug and make sure that this is fine.\ndebug and make sure that this is fine.\ndebug and make sure that this is fine. So that all compiled fine except for\nSo that all compiled fine except for\nSo that all compiled fine except for some closing brackets missing and all\nsome closing brackets missing and all\nsome closing brackets missing and all that. So now let's create a graph and\nthat. So now let's create a graph and\nthat. So now let's create a graph and also let's create let's test out this\nalso let's create let's test out this\nalso let's create let's test out this team that we have created. So let's\nteam that we have created. So let's\nteam that we have created. So let's first create the graph writing builder\nfirst create the graph writing builder\nfirst create the graph writing builder is your state graph state and let's\nis your state graph state and let's\nis your state graph state and let's writing builder dot add node going to\nwriting builder dot add node going to\nwriting builder dot add node going to add the supervisor node doc writing\nadd the supervisor node doc writing\nadd the supervisor node doc writing supervisor node and we're going to again\nsupervisor node and we're going to again\nsupervisor node and we're going to again create add another node which is so I'm\ncreate add another node which is so I'm\ncreate add another node which is so I'm just going to copy and paste it couple\njust going to copy and paste it couple\njust going to copy and paste it couple of times because we're going to create\nof times because we're going to create\nof times because we're going to create two more nodes now I'm going to say this\ntwo more nodes now I'm going to say this\ntwo more nodes now I'm going to say this is doc writer doc writing node And this\nis doc writer doc writing node And this\nis doc writer doc writing node And this is going to be the note taker note\nis going to be the note taker note\nis going to be the note taker note takingaking node. And this is going to\ntakingaking node. And this is going to\ntakingaking node. And this is going to be chart generator. And this is going to\nbe chart generator. And this is going to\nbe chart generator. And this is going to be chart generating node. Need to make\nbe chart generating node. Need to make\nbe chart generating node. Need to make sure it's not the agent but the actual\nsure it's not the agent but the actual\nsure it's not the agent but the actual node because we're building the graph.\nnode because we're building the graph.\nnode because we're building the graph. And we are now going to say writing\nAnd we are now going to say writing\nAnd we are now going to say writing builder dot add edge from the start to\nbuilder dot add edge from the start to\nbuilder dot add edge from the start to supervisor. And again writing builder\nsupervisor. And again writing builder\nsupervisor. And again writing builder dot compile writing graph is this one.\ndot compile writing graph is this one.\ndot compile writing graph is this one. So let's let's try to compile. There you\nSo let's let's try to compile. There you\nSo let's let's try to compile. There you go. So that ran fine. So we have got the\ngo. So that ran fine. So we have got the\ngo. So that ran fine. So we have got the writing graph now. So let's quickly test\nwriting graph now. So let's quickly test\nwriting graph now. So let's quickly test it out for sn writing graph dot stream\nit out for sn writing graph dot stream\nit out for sn writing graph dot stream messages is user. It's going to say\nmessages is user. It's going to say\nmessages is user. It's going to say write an outline for a poem about dogs.\nwrite an outline for a poem about dogs.\nwrite an outline for a poem about dogs. And after that, write the poem self and\nAnd after that, write the poem self and\nAnd after that, write the poem self and store it. Let's set the recussion limit.\nstore it. Let's set the recussion limit.\nstore it. Let's set the recussion limit. The recussion limit, let's say it's let\nThe recussion limit, let's say it's let\nThe recussion limit, let's say it's let it set it to 30. And in the loop, let's\nit set it to 30. And in the loop, let's\nit set it to 30. And in the loop, let's just print s and print few lines. So the\njust print s and print few lines. So the\njust print s and print few lines. So the supervisor is calling the dock writer.\nsupervisor is calling the dock writer.\nsupervisor is calling the dock writer. So now we can see that the agent is\nSo now we can see that the agent is\nSo now we can see that the agent is running fine. The agent team is running\nrunning fine. The agent team is running\nrunning fine. The agent team is running fine. And we can see the first message\nfine. And we can see the first message\nfine. And we can see the first message from the noteaker which says that you\nfrom the noteaker which says that you\nfrom the noteaker which says that you know the outline for the poem about dogs\nknow the outline for the poem about dogs\nknow the outline for the poem about dogs has been created and saved. And now we\nhas been created and saved. And now we\nhas been created and saved. And now we have the dock writer pitching in and say\nhave the dock writer pitching in and say\nhave the dock writer pitching in and say that I have written the poem titled the\nthat I have written the poem titled the\nthat I have written the poem titled the joy of dogs and saved both the outline\njoy of dogs and saved both the outline\njoy of dogs and saved both the outline and the final poem which is great. And\nand the final poem which is great. And\nand the final poem which is great. And the supervisor ends the execution of the\nthe supervisor ends the execution of the\nthe supervisor ends the execution of the task. So that is the writer team in\ntask. So that is the writer team in\ntask. So that is the writer team in action. Now our job is to put them all\naction. Now our job is to put them all\naction. Now our job is to put them all together and do the end to end graph\ntogether and do the end to end graph\ntogether and do the end to end graph which is going to be this graph we have\nwhich is going to be this graph we have\nwhich is going to be this graph we have been seeing. So we have this one ready\nbeen seeing. So we have this one ready\nbeen seeing. So we have this one ready and we have this one ready. Now we'll\nand we have this one ready. Now we'll\nand we have this one ready. Now we'll tie all of them together and hopefully\ntie all of them together and hopefully\ntie all of them together and hopefully we will have the multi- aent system\nwe will have the multi- aent system\nwe will have the multi- aent system working end to end. So let's go ahead\nworking end to end. So let's go ahead\nworking end to end. So let's go ahead with the coding now. So let's create the\nwith the coding now. So let's create the\nwith the coding now. So let's create the teams supervisor node obviously which is\nteams supervisor node obviously which is\nteams supervisor node obviously which is going to supervise both the research\ngoing to supervise both the research\ngoing to supervise both the research team and the writing team. So we're\nteam and the writing team. So we're\nteam and the writing team. So we're going to say make we're going to reuse\ngoing to say make we're going to reuse\ngoing to say make we're going to reuse the make supervisor node function again\nthe make supervisor node function again\nthe make supervisor node function again and we're going to pass the llm and for\nand we're going to pass the llm and for\nand we're going to pass the llm and for the teams we are going to say the\nthe teams we are going to say the\nthe teams we are going to say the research team and the writing team. So\nresearch team and the writing team. So\nresearch team and the writing team. So this will make sure that the writing\nthis will make sure that the writing\nthis will make sure that the writing team the supervisor and the research\nteam the supervisor and the research\nteam the supervisor and the research team all three of them work together in\nteam all three of them work together in\nteam all three of them work together in harmony. So let's try to run that. So\nharmony. So let's try to run that. So\nharmony. So let's try to run that. So that went through fine and now we need\nthat went through fine and now we need\nthat went through fine and now we need to write functions to call these teams.\nto write functions to call these teams.\nto write functions to call these teams. So basically define call research team\nSo basically define call research team\nSo basically define call research team and say we need to pass the state of\nand say we need to pass the state of\nand say we need to pass the state of course and we need to pass the command\ncourse and we need to pass the command\ncourse and we need to pass the command which is going to be the literal of the\nwhich is going to be the literal of the\nwhich is going to be the literal of the supervisor and we're going to say the\nsupervisor and we're going to say the\nsupervisor and we're going to say the response is equal to research graph dot\nresponse is equal to research graph dot\nresponse is equal to research graph dot invoke and we're going to invoke with\ninvoke and we're going to invoke with\ninvoke and we're going to invoke with the message state of messages of minus\nthe message state of messages of minus\nthe message state of messages of minus one. Let's close this and return command\none. Let's close this and return command\none. Let's close this and return command update is messages of human message and\nupdate is messages of human message and\nupdate is messages of human message and the content is response of messages\nthe content is response of messages\nthe content is response of messages minus one which is the last one the\nminus one which is the last one the\nminus one which is the last one the content of it and the name is research\ncontent of it and the name is research\ncontent of it and the name is research team and obviously we need to say go to\nteam and obviously we need to say go to\nteam and obviously we need to say go to because this is a command we are\nbecause this is a command we are\nbecause this is a command we are returning we need to make sure we pass\nreturning we need to make sure we pass\nreturning we need to make sure we pass the state and go to the go to in this\nthe state and go to the go to in this\nthe state and go to the go to in this case is the supervisor. So once we call\ncase is the supervisor. So once we call\ncase is the supervisor. So once we call define that that is going to call the\ndefine that that is going to call the\ndefine that that is going to call the research team. Similarly we need to call\nresearch team. Similarly we need to call\nresearch team. Similarly we need to call the the writer team and we're going to\nthe the writer team and we're going to\nthe the writer team and we're going to say instead of research graph we're\nsay instead of research graph we're\nsay instead of research graph we're going to say write writing graph let's\ngoing to say write writing graph let's\ngoing to say write writing graph let's call it call writing team. So supervisor\ncall it call writing team. So supervisor\ncall it call writing team. So supervisor nothing else changes message is the\nnothing else changes message is the\nnothing else changes message is the same. Instead of the research team here\nsame. Instead of the research team here\nsame. Instead of the research team here we are going to call it the writing\nwe are going to call it the writing\nwe are going to call it the writing team. So those are the two functions we\nteam. So those are the two functions we\nteam. So those are the two functions we need to create before we actually define\nneed to create before we actually define\nneed to create before we actually define the graph. So let's define the graph\nthe graph. So let's define the graph\nthe graph. So let's define the graph now. Superb builder which is the\nnow. Superb builder which is the\nnow. Superb builder which is the supervisor builder. So state graph of\nsupervisor builder. So state graph of\nsupervisor builder. So state graph of the state and again superb builder dot\nthe state and again superb builder dot\nthe state and again superb builder dot add node. Basically need to add the\nadd node. Basically need to add the\nadd node. Basically need to add the supervisor team supervisor node and we\nsupervisor team supervisor node and we\nsupervisor team supervisor node and we have couple of other nodes to add which\nhave couple of other nodes to add which\nhave couple of other nodes to add which is going to be the research team and\nis going to be the research team and\nis going to be the research team and we're going to say call research team\nwe're going to say call research team\nwe're going to say call research team and we're going to have a writing team.\nand we're going to have a writing team.\nand we're going to have a writing team. We're going to again pass the function\nWe're going to again pass the function\nWe're going to again pass the function call writing team and we obviously need\ncall writing team and we obviously need\ncall writing team and we obviously need to compile it now. So superb builder dot\nto compile it now. So superb builder dot\nto compile it now. So superb builder dot add edge from start to the supervisor.\nadd edge from start to the supervisor.\nadd edge from start to the supervisor. See we are defining this edge now from\nSee we are defining this edge now from\nSee we are defining this edge now from the start to the supervisor and these\nthe start to the supervisor and these\nthe start to the supervisor and these three are tied together by the graph\nthree are tied together by the graph\nthree are tied together by the graph that we are defining. So we have added\nthat we are defining. So we have added\nthat we are defining. So we have added the edge and then we're going to say\nthe edge and then we're going to say\nthe edge and then we're going to say super graph is that of the superb\nsuper graph is that of the superb\nsuper graph is that of the superb builder docompile and this compiles then\nbuilder docompile and this compiles then\nbuilder docompile and this compiles then we have the entire graph ready. So that\nwe have the entire graph ready. So that\nwe have the entire graph ready. So that compiled fine. We don't see any error. I\ncompiled fine. We don't see any error. I\ncompiled fine. We don't see any error. I just ran it. We can also go ahead and\njust ran it. We can also go ahead and\njust ran it. We can also go ahead and visualize it. All that we have to say is\nvisualize it. All that we have to say is\nvisualize it. All that we have to say is display the image of the super graph. We\ndisplay the image of the super graph. We\ndisplay the image of the super graph. We need to get the graph and draw mermaid\nneed to get the graph and draw mermaid\nneed to get the graph and draw mermaid png and we can see that we have the\npng and we can see that we have the\npng and we can see that we have the start, we have the supervisor, we have\nstart, we have the supervisor, we have\nstart, we have the supervisor, we have the research team, writing team and the\nthe research team, writing team and the\nthe research team, writing team and the from the supervisor we go to the end. So\nfrom the supervisor we go to the end. So\nfrom the supervisor we go to the end. So that's the hierarchical graph that we\nthat's the hierarchical graph that we\nthat's the hierarchical graph that we have created. We obviously need to run\nhave created. We obviously need to run\nhave created. We obviously need to run this. This is going to be the same. This\nthis. This is going to be the same. This\nthis. This is going to be the same. This is going to be the similar loop that we\nis going to be the similar loop that we\nis going to be the similar loop that we created before. So we're going to print\ncreated before. So we're going to print\ncreated before. So we're going to print s and print something like this. But\ns and print something like this. But\ns and print something like this. But inside the for loop, we are going to\ninside the for loop, we are going to\ninside the for loop, we are going to iterate through the messages which is\niterate through the messages which is\niterate through the messages which is going to be user. And I can pass the\ngoing to be user. And I can pass the\ngoing to be user. And I can pass the user message whatever I want. And I'm\nuser message whatever I want. And I'm\nuser message whatever I want. And I'm going to say research why the gold price\ngoing to say research why the gold price\ngoing to say research why the gold price has been increasing crazily in 2025.\nhas been increasing crazily in 2025.\nhas been increasing crazily in 2025. Come up with the reasons and compile a\nCome up with the reasons and compile a\nCome up with the reasons and compile a report. So that's my user input and I'm\nreport. So that's my user input and I'm\nreport. So that's my user input and I'm just going to run this graph. Moment of\njust going to run this graph. Moment of\njust going to run this graph. Moment of truth. Hopefully it will do all the\ntruth. Hopefully it will do all the\ntruth. Hopefully it will do all the research for me and come up with the\nresearch for me and come up with the\nresearch for me and come up with the report. So there's some syntax error.\nreport. So there's some syntax error.\nreport. So there's some syntax error. Obviously I need to close the messages,\nObviously I need to close the messages,\nObviously I need to close the messages, right? I need to also set the recussion\nright? I need to also set the recussion\nright? I need to also set the recussion limit. So recussion recursion\nlimit. So recussion recursion\nlimit. So recussion recursion limit instead of say 100 and let me\nlimit instead of say 100 and let me\nlimit instead of say 100 and let me close this. I haven't closed this one\nclose this. I haven't closed this one\nclose this. I haven't closed this one have I. So just going to close this\nhave I. So just going to close this\nhave I. So just going to close this hopefully. Right. This is going to be a\nhopefully. Right. This is going to be a\nhopefully. Right. This is going to be a comma because going to be a to this is a\ncomma because going to be a to this is a\ncomma because going to be a to this is a tpple. So we are passing we need to this\ntpple. So we are passing we need to this\ntpple. So we are passing we need to this is going to be a comma. We run that and\nis going to be a comma. We run that and\nis going to be a comma. We run that and there you go. So it has started its\nthere you go. So it has started its\nthere you go. So it has started its research. Now let's find out what\nresearch. Now let's find out what\nresearch. Now let's find out what exactly we get as the output. Fingers\nexactly we get as the output. Fingers\nexactly we get as the output. Fingers crossed. I'm going to give it its own\ncrossed. I'm going to give it its own\ncrossed. I'm going to give it its own time and eventually see what the result\ntime and eventually see what the result\ntime and eventually see what the result is. So there you go. It finally\nis. So there you go. It finally\nis. So there you go. It finally completed the execution of the loop and\ncompleted the execution of the loop and\ncompleted the execution of the loop and we can see that it went to the research\nwe can see that it went to the research\nwe can see that it went to the research team and it went to the writing team and\nteam and it went to the writing team and\nteam and it went to the writing team and the writing team and went through this\nthe writing team and went through this\nthe writing team and went through this loop several times. So once it has\nloop several times. So once it has\nloop several times. So once it has completed this loop uh it was able to\ncompleted this loop uh it was able to\ncompleted this loop uh it was able to save a couple of files. So the the files\nsave a couple of files. So the the files\nsave a couple of files. So the the files that it saved were this one which is the\nthat it saved were this one which is the\nthat it saved were this one which is the you know the market analysis outline\nyou know the market analysis outline\nyou know the market analysis outline which is the outline of what it needs to\nwhich is the outline of what it needs to\nwhich is the outline of what it needs to talk about. One is the introduction of\ntalk about. One is the introduction of\ntalk about. One is the introduction of the the economic uncertainty,\nthe the economic uncertainty,\nthe the economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, US dollar\ngeopolitical tensions, US dollar\ngeopolitical tensions, US dollar weakness, investment strategies and\nweakness, investment strategies and\nweakness, investment strategies and speculation and conclusion. So that's\nspeculation and conclusion. So that's\nspeculation and conclusion. So that's the outline that it has created and\nthe outline that it has created and\nthe outline that it has created and eventually it has created this report as\neventually it has created this report as\neventually it has created this report as well. It's not pretty deep or pretty uh\nwell. It's not pretty deep or pretty uh\nwell. It's not pretty deep or pretty uh detailed but uh it has created a report\ndetailed but uh it has created a report\ndetailed but uh it has created a report and says in 2025 the gold market witness\nand says in 2025 the gold market witness\nand says in 2025 the gold market witness profound up search with prices exceeding\nprofound up search with prices exceeding\nprofound up search with prices exceeding 4,000 per ounce which is approximately a\n4,000 per ounce which is approximately a\n4,000 per ounce which is approximately a 49% increase. Several interventors\n49% increase. Several interventors\n49% increase. Several interventors contribute to this significant surge\ncontribute to this significant surge\ncontribute to this significant surge blah blah blah and it expands on the\nblah blah blah and it expands on the\nblah blah blah and it expands on the several points such as you know economic\nseveral points such as you know economic\nseveral points such as you know economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and\nuncertainty, geopolitical tensions and\nuncertainty, geopolitical tensions and US dollar weakness. the same things that\nUS dollar weakness. the same things that\nUS dollar weakness. the same things that it outlined in the outline file. Here\nit outlined in the outline file. Here\nit outlined in the outline file. Here it's able to go and get more details or\nit's able to go and get more details or\nit's able to go and get more details or give more details about those points. So\ngive more details about those points. So\ngive more details about those points. So that is all that I wanted to show today.\nthat is all that I wanted to show today.\nthat is all that I wanted to show today. Okay, basically we implemented this\nOkay, basically we implemented this\nOkay, basically we implemented this hierarchical agent and we had two teams\nhierarchical agent and we had two teams\nhierarchical agent and we had two teams which were acting together or working\nwhich were acting together or working\nwhich were acting together or working together along with the supervisor agent\ntogether along with the supervisor agent\ntogether along with the supervisor agent and together they are able to you know\nand together they are able to you know\nand together they are able to you know do some research and come up with some\ndo some research and come up with some\ndo some research and come up with some bullet points and with those bullet\nbullet points and with those bullet\nbullet points and with those bullet points do some writing of some article\npoints do some writing of some article\npoints do some writing of some article or some quote.

Um you know whenever we go ahead and start any kind of projects or you\nand start any kind of projects or you\nand start any kind of projects or you build any applications right it is\nbuild any applications right it is\nbuild any applications right it is necessary that you start creating an\nnecessary that you start creating an\nnecessary that you start creating an environment. Um most of my videos I've\nenvironment. Um most of my videos I've\nenvironment. Um most of my videos I've actually shown how to create\nactually shown how to create\nactually shown how to create environments with the help of but in\nenvironments with the help of but in\nenvironments with the help of but in this particular video we are going to\nthis particular video we are going to\nthis particular video we are going to use something called as UV package\nuse something called as UV package\nuse something called as UV package manager. Okay. Yes, you can also use\nmanager. Okay. Yes, you can also use\nmanager. Okay. Yes, you can also use cond. Uh but if you don't know about UV\ncond. Uh but if you don't know about UV\ncond. Uh but if you don't know about UV package manager, it is a really fast,\npackage manager, it is a really fast,\npackage manager, it is a really fast, extremely fast Python package and\nextremely fast Python package and\nextremely fast Python package and project manager and it is completely\nproject manager and it is completely\nproject manager and it is completely written in Rust. Since it is written in\nwritten in Rust. Since it is written in\nwritten in Rust. Since it is written in Rust, it is very very fast. So you can\nRust, it is very very fast. So you can\nRust, it is very very fast. So you can probably compare over here from UV to\nprobably compare over here from UV to\nprobably compare over here from UV to poetry to pdm and pipsync. This has the\npoetry to pdm and pipsync. This has the\npoetry to pdm and pipsync. This has the least time. Uh that means that whenever\nleast time. Uh that means that whenever\nleast time. Uh that means that whenever you're trying to create an environment\nyou're trying to create an environment\nyou're trying to create an environment or do any kind of installation of the\nor do any kind of installation of the\nor do any kind of installation of the packages, that happens really really\npackages, that happens really really\npackages, that happens really really fast. Okay, some of the highlights that\nfast. Okay, some of the highlights that\nfast. Okay, some of the highlights that you can see over here. It is 10 to 100\nyou can see over here. It is 10 to 100\nyou can see over here. It is 10 to 100 times faster than pip. Uh it is a single\ntimes faster than pip. Uh it is a single\ntimes faster than pip. Uh it is a single tool to replace pip, pip tools, pipex,\ntool to replace pip, pip tools, pipex,\ntool to replace pip, pip tools, pipex, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtually envir.\npoetry, pyenv, twine, virtually envir.\npoetry, pyenv, twine, virtually envir. Uh it provides comprehensive project\nUh it provides comprehensive project\nUh it provides comprehensive project management and universal lock file. It\nmanagement and universal lock file.

And if you're using pi, uh just go ahead and\nif you're using pi, uh just go ahead and\nif you're using pi, uh just go ahead and write pip install uv. Okay. Uh once that\nwrite pip install uv. Okay. Uh once that\nwrite pip install uv. Okay. Uh once that is done, your uh you know the entire\nis done, your uh you know the entire\nis done, your uh you know the entire project repository will be initialized.\nproject repository will be initialized.\nproject repository will be initialized. Okay. So first of all, what I'm actually\nOkay. So first of all, what I'm actually\nOkay. So first of all, what I'm actually going to do is that I'll just go ahead\ngoing to do is that I'll just go ahead\ngoing to do is that I'll just go ahead and open my terminal. Now inside this\nand open my terminal. Now inside this\nand open my terminal. Now inside this terminal I will open my command prompt.\nterminal I will open my command prompt.\nterminal I will open my command prompt. I've already done the installation of UV\nI've already done the installation of UV\nI've already done the installation of UV package manager. So I will just go ahead\npackage manager. So I will just go ahead\npackage manager. So I will just go ahead and quickly initialize my uh project\nand quickly initialize my uh project\nand quickly initialize my uh project workspace. In order to initialize all I\nworkspace. In order to initialize all I\nworkspace. In order to initialize all I have to do is that I have to write uv\nhave to do is that I have to write uv\nhave to do is that I have to write uv init. Okay. As soon as I write u init\ninit. Okay. As soon as I write u init\ninit. Okay. As soon as I write u init will happen in the project workspace.\nwill happen in the project workspace.\nwill happen in the project workspace. Okay. So here you can see in the project\nOkay. So here you can see in the project\nOkay. So here you can see in the project workspace there are some files that has\nworkspace there are some files that has\nworkspace there are some files that has got created like get ignore python\ngot created like get ignore python\ngot created like get ignore python version main.py pipro.2ml 2 mm uh and\nversion main.py pipro.2ml 2 mm uh and\nversion main.py pipro.2ml 2 mm uh and and if you probably go ahead and see in\nand if you probably go ahead and see in\nand if you probably go ahead and see in Python version which Python version you\nPython version which Python version you\nPython version which Python version you have actually created it is nothing but\nhave actually created it is nothing but\nhave actually created it is nothing but 3.13 then you also have this main py so\n3.13 then you also have this main py so\n3.13 then you also have this main py so that you can start the program execution\nthat you can start the program execution\nthat you can start the program execution directly from here then you have this pi\ndirectly from here then you have this pi\ndirectly from here then you have this pi project toml wherein you have the\nproject toml wherein you have the\nproject toml wherein you have the project brief information uh you can\nproject brief information uh you can\nproject brief information uh you can change the version you can add your own\nchange the version you can add your own\nchange the version you can add your own description and all um here you can see\ndescription and all um here you can see\ndescription and all um here you can see that it is requiring a python of minimum\nthat it is requiring a python of minimum\nthat it is requiring a python of minimum 3.13 okay this dependency is right now\n3.13 okay this dependency is right now\n3.13 okay this dependency is right now empty because we have not installed any\nempty because we have not installed any\nempty because we have not installed any kind of packages is now what I'm\nkind of packages is now what I'm\nkind of packages is now what I'm actually going to do is that I'm going\nactually going to do is that I'm going\nactually going to do is that I'm going to go ahead and create my\nto go ahead and create my\nto go ahead and create my requirement.txt.\nrequirement.txt.\nrequirement.txt. Now inside my requirement.txt I will go\nNow inside my requirement.txt I will go\nNow inside my requirement.txt I will go ahead and install some of the libraries.\nahead and install some of the libraries.\nahead and install some of the libraries. Let's say lang graph lang chain. Then\nLet's say lang graph lang chain. Then\nLet's say lang graph lang chain. Then along with this I will also go ahead and\nalong with this I will also go ahead and\nalong with this I will also go ahead and use my lang. Okay. Uh all our libraries\nuse my lang. Okay. Uh all our libraries\nuse my lang. Okay. Uh all our libraries that will be specifically useful. Uh and\nthat will be specifically useful. Uh and\nthat will be specifically useful. Uh and I'll tell you as we go ahead lang and\nI'll tell you as we go ahead lang and\nI'll tell you as we go ahead lang and lang chain we're going to use various\nlang chain we're going to use various\nlang chain we're going to use various functionalities in order to build\nfunctionalities in order to build\nfunctionalities in order to build generative AI applications. chat bots\ngenerative AI applications. chat bots\ngenerative AI applications. chat bots along with that agent AI applications\nalong with that agent AI applications\nalong with that agent AI applications also uh lang is basically used for uh\nalso uh lang is basically used for uh\nalso uh lang is basically used for uh tracking and evaluation of your applica\ntracking and evaluation of your applica\ntracking and evaluation of your applica applications you know directly in the\napplications you know directly in the\napplications you know directly in the langraph cloud so these are the basic\nlangraph cloud so these are the basic\nlangraph cloud so these are the basic libraries that we're going to use now\nlibraries that we're going to use now\nlibraries that we're going to use now since I have already initialized this\nsince I have already initialized this\nsince I have already initialized this working space now the next thing is that\nworking space now the next thing is that\nworking space now the next thing is that I need to go ahead and create my virtual\nI need to go ahead and create my virtual\nI need to go ahead and create my virtual environment so quickly I will go ahead\nenvironment so quickly I will go ahead\nenvironment so quickly I will go ahead and write uv venv um with the help of\nand write uv venv um with the help of\nand write uv venv um with the help of this command you'll be able to create a\nthis command you'll be able to create a\nthis command you'll be able to create a virtual environment this venv is nothing\nvirtual environment this venv is nothing\nvirtual environment this venv is nothing but your uh virtual environment name.\nbut your uh virtual environment name.\nbut your uh virtual environment name. Okay. So once I go ahead and write uvnv\nOkay. So once I go ahead and write uvnv\nOkay. So once I go ahead and write uvnv here you can see that it has got created\nhere you can see that it has got created\nhere you can see that it has got created with the help of this particular version\nwith the help of this particular version\nwith the help of this particular version that is 3.13.2.\nthat is 3.13.2.\nthat is 3.13.2. The virtual environment is at this\nThe virtual environment is at this\nThe virtual environment is at this location.v over here. Now in order to\nlocation.v over here. Now in order to\nlocation.v over here. Now in order to activate the environment I'll just go\nactivate the environment I'll just go\nactivate the environment I'll just go ahead and copy this quickly. I will\nahead and copy this quickly. I will\nahead and copy this quickly. I will paste it over here. Okay. So once I\npaste it over here. Okay. So once I\npaste it over here. Okay. So once I activate this here you can clearly see\nactivate this here you can clearly see\nactivate this here you can clearly see that hey uh my my uh environment has got\nthat hey uh my my uh environment has got\nthat hey uh my my uh environment has got activated. Okay. So here agentic lang\nactivated. Okay. So here agentic lang\nactivated. Okay. So here agentic lang graph has got activated. Now this is\ngraph has got activated. Now this is\ngraph has got activated. Now this is perfect till here everything looks good.\nperfect till here everything looks good.\nperfect till here everything looks good. Now the next step is that we'll go ahead\nNow the next step is that we'll go ahead\nNow the next step is that we'll go ahead and do the installation of all the\nand do the installation of all the\nand do the installation of all the libraries. So in order to do it u like\nlibraries. So in order to do it u like\nlibraries. So in order to do it u like if you're using pip it is like pip\nif you're using pip it is like pip\nif you're using pip it is like pip install minus r requirement.xt. But here\ninstall minus r requirement.xt. But here\ninstall minus r requirement.xt. But here we are going to write uv minus r\nwe are going to write uv minus r\nwe are going to write uv minus r requirement.xt. Okay. So once you do\nrequirement.xt. Okay. So once you do\nrequirement.xt. Okay. So once you do this installation here you can quickly\nthis installation here you can quickly\nthis installation here you can quickly see that the installation has been\nsee that the installation has been\nsee that the installation has been completed. And now if you go ahead and\ncompleted. And now if you go ahead and\ncompleted. And now if you go ahead and open this particular file. All the\nopen this particular file. All the\nopen this particular file. All the libraries that has got installed will be\nlibraries that has got installed will be\nlibraries that has got installed will be visible over here. Okay. Now as I said\nvisible over here. Okay. Now as I said\nvisible over here. Okay. Now as I said uh this is my first tutorial. I'll go\nuh this is my first tutorial. I'll go\nuh this is my first tutorial. I'll go ahead and just write one folder name one\nahead and just write one folder name one\nahead and just write one folder name one and I'll say hey uh basic chatbot. Okay.\nand I'll say hey uh basic chatbot. Okay.\nand I'll say hey uh basic chatbot. Okay. And we'll we'll just learn some of the\nAnd we'll we'll just learn some of the\nAnd we'll we'll just learn some of the basic stuffs over here. Okay. Now with\nbasic stuffs over here. Okay. Now with\nbasic stuffs over here. Okay. Now with respect to this particular basic chatbot\nrespect to this particular basic chatbot\nrespect to this particular basic chatbot uh here we are going to go ahead and\nuh here we are going to go ahead and\nuh here we are going to go ahead and create our um you know applications. So\ncreate our um you know applications. So\ncreate our um you know applications. So we'll go ahead and create our basic\nwe'll go ahead and create our basic\nwe'll go ahead and create our basic chatbot itself. Um we'll just go ahead\nchatbot itself. Um we'll just go ahead\nchatbot itself. Um we'll just go ahead and open my one file. Let's say I'll go\nand open my one file. Let's say I'll go\nand open my one file. Let's say I'll go ahead and write basic chatbot ipynb.\nahead and write basic chatbot ipynb.\nahead and write basic chatbot ipynb. Okay. So as soon as I open this basic\nOkay. So as soon as I open this basic\nOkay. So as soon as I open this basic chatbot ipynb, it will tell me to select\nchatbot ipynb, it will tell me to select\nchatbot ipynb, it will tell me to select a kernel. I will go ahead and select a\na kernel. I will go ahead and select a\na kernel. I will go ahead and select a kernel. And since I'm using Jupyter\nkernel. And since I'm using Jupyter\nkernel. And since I'm using Jupyter notebook for the initial stages, um I\nnotebook for the initial stages, um I\nnotebook for the initial stages, um I also have to go ahead and add one more\nalso have to go ahead and add one more\nalso have to go ahead and add one more library UV add ipi kernel. Okay. So\nlibrary UV add ipi kernel. Okay. So\nlibrary UV add ipi kernel. Okay. So follow the steps step by step like you\nfollow the steps step by step like you\nfollow the steps step by step like you have to just follow this steps as we go\nhave to just follow this steps as we go\nhave to just follow this steps as we go ahead because IPI kernel will be\nahead because IPI kernel will be\nahead because IPI kernel will be required in order to run anything in the\nrequired in order to run anything in the\nrequired in order to run anything in the Jupyter notebook. Okay. Now once this is\nJupyter notebook. Okay. Now once this is\nJupyter notebook. Okay. Now once this is done I will start writing my code over\ndone I will start writing my code over\ndone I will start writing my code over here. Okay. U now with respect to the\nhere. Okay. U now with respect to the\nhere. Okay. U now with respect to the code let's check whether this is working\ncode let's check whether this is working\ncode let's check whether this is working or not. Okay. It should give an error\nor not. Okay. It should give an error\nor not. Okay. It should give an error because oneplus exclamation is something\nbecause oneplus exclamation is something\nbecause oneplus exclamation is something happening over here. Here you can see it\nhappening over here. Here you can see it\nhappening over here. Here you can see it is connecting to the kernel agentic.\nis connecting to the kernel agentic.\nis connecting to the kernel agentic. Okay. So yeah invalid syntax. Now if I\nOkay. So yeah invalid syntax. Now if I\nOkay. So yeah invalid syntax. Now if I go ahead and write 1 + 1, it is working\ngo ahead and write 1 + 1, it is working\ngo ahead and write 1 + 1, it is working fine. Perfect. Now here as I said um let\nfine. Perfect. Now here as I said um let\nfine. Perfect. Now here as I said um let me just quickly go ahead and write here\nme just quickly go ahead and write here\nme just quickly go ahead and write here we are going to build a basic\nwe are going to build a basic\nwe are going to build a basic basic chatbot. Okay. Now building a\nbasic chatbot. Okay. Now building a\nbasic chatbot. Okay. Now building a basic chatbot uh um you know this this\nbasic chatbot uh um you know this this\nbasic chatbot uh um you know this this chatbot is like a basic chatbot that\nchatbot is like a basic chatbot that\nchatbot is like a basic chatbot that basically means uh and here whenever I'm\nbasically means uh and here whenever I'm\nbasically means uh and here whenever I'm talking with respect to lang graph okay\ntalking with respect to lang graph okay\ntalking with respect to lang graph okay with lang graph I'll go ahead and write\nwith lang graph I'll go ahead and write\nwith lang graph I'll go ahead and write that here we are going to use the graph\nthat here we are going to use the graph\nthat here we are going to use the graph API functionality okay there is one more\nAPI functionality okay there is one more\nAPI functionality okay there is one more API which is called as functional API as\nAPI which is called as functional API as\nAPI which is called as functional API as we go ahead we'll also try to learn\nwe go ahead we'll also try to learn\nwe go ahead we'll also try to learn about it but what I felt is that the\nabout it but what I felt is that the\nabout it but what I felt is that the most efficient way of learning lang\nmost efficient way of learning lang\nmost efficient way of learning lang graph is specifically using this graph\ngraph is specifically using this graph\ngraph is specifically using this graph API Okay. Okay. Um, so let's start with\nAPI Okay. Okay. Um, so let's start with\nAPI Okay. Okay. Um, so let's start with this and uh let me go ahead and write\nthis and uh let me go ahead and write\nthis and uh let me go ahead and write some information you know how you should\nsome information you know how you should\nsome information you know how you should actually go ahead and start and all the\nactually go ahead and start and all the\nactually go ahead and start and all the things you know and what we are\nthings you know and what we are\nthings you know and what we are basically going to develop. Okay. So\nbasically going to develop. Okay. So\nbasically going to develop. Okay. So guys, now let's go ahead and build a\nguys, now let's go ahead and build a\nguys, now let's go ahead and build a basic chatbot with the help of Langraph.\nbasic chatbot with the help of Langraph.\nbasic chatbot with the help of Langraph.

And with the help of this particular transcript since I need to\nparticular transcript since I need to\nparticular transcript since I need to start writing my blog I will go ahead\nstart writing my blog I will go ahead\nstart writing my blog I will go ahead and create the title of the blog. Okay.\nand create the title of the blog. Okay.\nand create the title of the blog. Okay. And in third step\nAnd in third step\nAnd in third step I want to take both title\nI want to take both title\nI want to take both title and transcript\nand we will go ahead and create the\nand we will go ahead and create the content\ncontent\ncontent of the blog. Right? So if I want to\nof the blog. Right? So if I want to\nof the blog. Right? So if I want to solve this use case, you know, this will\nsolve this use case, you know, this will\nsolve this use case, you know, this will be my workflow to solve this use case.\nbe my workflow to solve this use case.\nbe my workflow to solve this use case. You know, first of all, I need to go\nYou know, first of all, I need to go\nYou know, first of all, I need to go ahead and take out the transcript from\nahead and take out the transcript from\nahead and take out the transcript from the YouTube video. Then I need to go\nthe YouTube video. Then I need to go\nthe YouTube video. Then I need to go ahead and based on the transcript, we\nahead and based on the transcript, we\nahead and based on the transcript, we need to go ahead and generate a title.\nneed to go ahead and generate a title.\nneed to go ahead and generate a title. And then based on the title and\nAnd then based on the title and\nAnd then based on the title and transcript, we need to generate a\ntranscript, we need to generate a\ntranscript, we need to generate a content. Right now I am alone uploading\ncontent. Right now I am alone uploading\ncontent. Right now I am alone uploading the videos and it is not possible that I\nthe videos and it is not possible that I\nthe videos and it is not possible that I also go ahead and create the blog out of\nalso go ahead and create the blog out of\nalso go ahead and create the blog out of it because it will take more of time.\nit because it will take more of time.\nit because it will take more of time. But since when like LLMs right now is\nBut since when like LLMs right now is\nBut since when like LLMs right now is the buzz word, right? We definitely have\nthe buzz word, right? We definitely have\nthe buzz word, right? We definitely have LLMs.\nLLMs.\nLLMs. Now with respect to LLMs, you know that\nNow with respect to LLMs, you know that\nNow with respect to LLMs, you know that these are really really good at content\nthese are really really good at content\nthese are really really good at content generation.\ngeneration.\ngeneration. It is very very good at content\nIt is very very good at content\nIt is very very good at content generation. Right? Now whenever we talk\ngeneration. Right? Now whenever we talk\ngeneration. Right? Now whenever we talk about content generation that basically\nabout content generation that basically\nabout content generation that basically means LLM it can take an input. Let's\nmeans LLM it can take an input. Let's\nmeans LLM it can take an input. Let's say if I say hey what is machine\nsay if I say hey what is machine\nsay if I say hey what is machine learning? It'll be able to generate what\nlearning? It'll be able to generate what\nlearning? It'll be able to generate what is exactly machine learning. Right? Now\nis exactly machine learning. Right? Now\nis exactly machine learning. Right? Now can we use LLM in order to solve this\ncan we use LLM in order to solve this\ncan we use LLM in order to solve this particular workflow with the help of\nparticular workflow with the help of\nparticular workflow with the help of langraph. Now in order to solve this\nlangraph. Now in order to solve this\nlangraph. Now in order to solve this problem what I will be doing is that I\nproblem what I will be doing is that I\nproblem what I will be doing is that I will follow some kind of graph\nwill follow some kind of graph\nwill follow some kind of graph structure. Okay. And yes in langraph if\nstructure. Okay. And yes in langraph if\nstructure. Okay. And yes in langraph if you want to solve this kind of\nyou want to solve this kind of\nyou want to solve this kind of workflows. There are two ways. Okay.\nworkflows. There are two ways. Okay.\nworkflows. There are two ways. Okay. One is directly using graph API.\nOne is directly using graph API.\nOne is directly using graph API. graph API\ngraph API\ngraph API and second one is directly by using\nand second one is directly by using\nand second one is directly by using functional API\nfunctional API\nfunctional API functional API but according to my\nfunctional API but according to my\nfunctional API but according to my experience I feel graph API is the most\nexperience I feel graph API is the most\nexperience I feel graph API is the most easiest and most best way yes if you\neasiest and most best way yes if you\neasiest and most best way yes if you have lot of expertise with respect to\nhave lot of expertise with respect to\nhave lot of expertise with respect to the graph API you can directly go ahead\nthe graph API you can directly go ahead\nthe graph API you can directly go ahead and use the functional API the\nand use the functional API the\nand use the functional API the difference between them we will get to\ndifference between them we will get to\ndifference between them we will get to know as we go ahead okay so first of all\nknow as we go ahead okay so first of all\nknow as we go ahead okay so first of all what we'll do in order to solve this\nwhat we'll do in order to solve this\nwhat we'll do in order to solve this complex workflow I will go ahead and\ncomplex workflow I will go ahead and\ncomplex workflow I will go ahead and create some kind of graphs. Okay. And\ncreate some kind of graphs. Okay. And\ncreate some kind of graphs. Okay. And this graph will show that how my flow of\nthis graph will show that how my flow of\nthis graph will show that how my flow of execution will happen. Okay. So let's\nexecution will happen. Okay. So let's\nexecution will happen. Okay. So let's say that I have this node\nsay that I have this node\nsay that I have this node I have one more node. Okay. So these are\nI have one more node. Okay. So these are\nI have one more node. Okay. So these are my two nodes. As I said the components\nmy two nodes. As I said the components\nmy two nodes. As I said the components of langraph are edges, nodes and state.\nof langraph are edges, nodes and state.\nof langraph are edges, nodes and state. Okay. So initially let's say we are\nOkay. So initially let's say we are\nOkay. So initially let's say we are going to go ahead and start over here.\ngoing to go ahead and start over here.\ngoing to go ahead and start over here. Okay. So here I will be having my start\nOkay. So here I will be having my start\nOkay. So here I will be having my start node.\nnode.\nnode. Okay. In this start node we give our\nOkay. In this start node we give our\nOkay. In this start node we give our input\ninput\ninput right. Let's say in this particular case\nright. Let's say in this particular case\nright. Let's say in this particular case in my use case obviously I need to give\nin my use case obviously I need to give\nin my use case obviously I need to give some kind of input. Now what input I\nsome kind of input. Now what input I\nsome kind of input. Now what input I will give? I will give my YouTube URL.\nwill give? I will give my YouTube URL.\nwill give? I will give my YouTube URL. Okay let's say this is my input YouTube\nOkay let's say this is my input YouTube\nOkay let's say this is my input YouTube URL. Then it goes to this phase from\nURL. Then it goes to this phase from\nURL. Then it goes to this phase from start it goes to this node. This node\nstart it goes to this node. This node\nstart it goes to this node. This node should be responsible in taking out the\nshould be responsible in taking out the\nshould be responsible in taking out the transcript from my YouTube video. So\ntranscript from my YouTube video. So\ntranscript from my YouTube video. So here I can go ahead and write, hey, this\nhere I can go ahead and write, hey, this\nhere I can go ahead and write, hey, this is my\nis my\nis my transcript.\ntranscript.\ntranscript. Okay, this is my transcript generator.\nOkay, this is my transcript generator.\nOkay, this is my transcript generator. Now, how do I go ahead and generate the\nNow, how do I go ahead and generate the\nNow, how do I go ahead and generate the transcript in Langchain?\ntranscript in Langchain?\ntranscript in Langchain? In Langchain, we have some third party\nIn Langchain, we have some third party\nIn Langchain, we have some third party libraries. No, I think there is\nlibraries. No, I think there is\nlibraries. No, I think there is something like YT loader or what it does\nsomething like YT loader or what it does\nsomething like YT loader or what it does is that we give our input videos of the\nis that we give our input videos of the\nis that we give our input videos of the YouTube and output we will be able to\nYouTube and output we will be able to\nYouTube and output we will be able to get the transcript. So here output of\nget the transcript. So here output of\nget the transcript. So here output of this particular node should be that we\nthis particular node should be that we\nthis particular node should be that we should be able to get a transcript.\nshould be able to get a transcript.\nshould be able to get a transcript. Okay. Now understand one thing over\nOkay. Now understand one thing over\nOkay. Now understand one thing over here. So what is this? This is nothing\nhere. So what is this? This is nothing\nhere. So what is this? This is nothing but this is my node.\nbut this is my node.\nbut this is my node. What is this? This is nothing but this\nWhat is this? This is nothing but this\nWhat is this? This is nothing but this is my edge. Right? So this is nothing\nis my edge. Right? So this is nothing\nis my edge. Right? So this is nothing but edge.\nbut edge.\nbut edge. Edge main fundamental is that the flow\nEdge main fundamental is that the flow\nEdge main fundamental is that the flow of information should go from here to\nof information should go from here to\nof information should go from here to here or node to node. Right? So this is\nhere or node to node. Right? So this is\nhere or node to node. Right? So this is also my edge.\nalso my edge.\nalso my edge. Right? Now whenever we talk about nodes,\nRight? Now whenever we talk about nodes,\nRight? Now whenever we talk about nodes, right? As soon as you create a node, we\nright? As soon as you create a node, we\nright? As soon as you create a node, we also have to create a node\nalso have to create a node\nalso have to create a node implementation,\nimplementation,\nimplementation, right? Some functionality with respect\nright? Some functionality with respect\nright? Some functionality with respect to this particular node. Like what does\nto this particular node. Like what does\nto this particular node. Like what does this node actually do? Now in this\nthis node actually do? Now in this\nthis node actually do? Now in this particular case this node functionality\nparticular case this node functionality\nparticular case this node functionality should be that it should take a YouTube\nshould be that it should take a YouTube\nshould be that it should take a YouTube URL and it should generate a transcript.\nURL and it should generate a transcript.\nURL and it should generate a transcript. Okay. And the output of this node should\nOkay. And the output of this node should\nOkay. And the output of this node should be this transcript. Okay. Now in my\nbe this transcript. Okay. Now in my\nbe this transcript. Okay. Now in my workflow I have completed this YT video\nworkflow I have completed this YT video\nworkflow I have completed this YT video to transcript by that node. Now based on\nto transcript by that node. Now based on\nto transcript by that node. Now based on this transcript I should be generating\nthis transcript I should be generating\nthis transcript I should be generating the title. So what this node will be\nthe title. So what this node will be\nthe title. So what this node will be doing this is nothing but this will be\ndoing this is nothing but this will be\ndoing this is nothing but this will be title generator.\ntitle generator.\ntitle generator. And here the input will be transcript\nAnd here the input will be transcript\nAnd here the input will be transcript right. The input will be transcript. And\nright. The input will be transcript. And\nright. The input will be transcript. And this will be my next node. And this node\nthis will be my next node. And this node\nthis will be my next node. And this node functionality should be that it should\nfunctionality should be that it should\nfunctionality should be that it should take this transcript\ntake this transcript\ntake this transcript and it should generate the title.\nand it should generate the title.\nand it should generate the title. Right? This is what is my functionality.\nRight? This is what is my functionality.\nRight? This is what is my functionality. Very simple functionality. Right? Now\nVery simple functionality. Right? Now\nVery simple functionality. Right? Now after this\nafter this\nafter this the output that we're going to give\nthe output that we're going to give\nthe output that we're going to give right\nright\nright should be\nshould be\nshould be my title. Along with the title I also\nmy title. Along with the title I also\nmy title. Along with the title I also want to give my transcript\nwant to give my transcript\nwant to give my transcript and we go to the next step. What is the\nand we go to the next step. What is the\nand we go to the next step. What is the next step over here which is nothing but\nnext step over here which is nothing but\nnext step over here which is nothing but content generation. So my third node\ncontent generation. So my third node\ncontent generation. So my third node that you'll be able to see over here is\nthat you'll be able to see over here is\nthat you'll be able to see over here is nothing but it is\nnothing but it is\nnothing but it is content generator\ncontent generator right. So this will\ncontent generator right. So this will again be my edge\nagain be my edge\nagain be my edge and this node will have a functionality\nand this node will have a functionality\nand this node will have a functionality which will take this information title\nwhich will take this information title\nwhich will take this information title and transcript and it will generate\nand transcript and it will generate\nand transcript and it will generate content\ncontent\ncontent right and finally you go to the next\nright and finally you go to the next\nright and finally you go to the next step which is end in the end you get the\nstep which is end in the end you get the\nstep which is end in the end you get the output\noutput\noutput right now see now you may be thinking\nright now see now you may be thinking\nright now see now you may be thinking how do we generate transcript to title.\nhow do we generate transcript to title.\nhow do we generate transcript to title. Now if you have a fundamental idea of\nNow if you have a fundamental idea of\nNow if you have a fundamental idea of LLM. So here in my title generator I\nLLM. So here in my title generator I\nLLM. So here in my title generator I will have an LLM along with one prompt\nwill have an LLM along with one prompt\nwill have an LLM along with one prompt and then when we give this input of\nand then when we give this input of\nand then when we give this input of transcript\nit should be able to generate the\nit should be able to generate the output. Right? Similarly for this\noutput. Right? Similarly for this\noutput. Right? Similarly for this content generator which is the node. If\ncontent generator which is the node. If\ncontent generator which is the node. If I give the title and transcript here\nI give the title and transcript here\nI give the title and transcript here again I will be having some kind of LLM\nagain I will be having some kind of LLM\nagain I will be having some kind of LLM plus some prompt which will be able to\nplus some prompt which will be able to\nplus some prompt which will be able to generate the content. Here we give the\ngenerate the content. Here we give the\ngenerate the content. Here we give the input as transcript and we get the\ninput as transcript and we get the\ninput as transcript and we get the output over here. Right? And finally all\noutput over here. Right? And finally all\noutput over here. Right? And finally all this output is combined and we get\nthis output is combined and we get\nthis output is combined and we get display it over here. Right? So this is\ndisplay it over here. Right? So this is\ndisplay it over here. Right? So this is an example of a workflow and this is\nan example of a workflow and this is\nan example of a workflow and this is entirely with the help of graph API. We\nentirely with the help of graph API. We\nentirely with the help of graph API. We will be able to see the graph uh we'll\nwill be able to see the graph uh we'll\nwill be able to see the graph uh we'll be able to see the execution. We'll be\nbe able to see the execution. We'll be\nbe able to see the execution. We'll be able to see the output. Okay. Now coming\nable to see the output. Okay. Now coming\nable to see the output. Okay. Now coming to this right I have told you already\nto this right I have told you already\nto this right I have told you already about edges and nodes right now where\nabout edges and nodes right now where\nabout edges and nodes right now where does state come into existence. Okay.\ndoes state come into existence. Okay.\ndoes state come into existence. Okay. Now see based on this particular use\nNow see based on this particular use\nNow see based on this particular use case\ncase\ncase state we can define something right. So\nstate we can define something right. So\nstate we can define something right. So here this state will have some values or\nhere this state will have some values or\nhere this state will have some values or some variables we can define some\nsome variables we can define some\nsome variables we can define some variables and that variables\nvariables and that variables\nvariables and that variables will like that variables can be accessed\nwill like that variables can be accessed\nwill like that variables can be accessed by any of this node in this particular\nby any of this node in this particular\nby any of this node in this particular graph. Okay. So let's say for this\ngraph. Okay. So let's say for this\ngraph. Okay. So let's say for this particular use case you know that I\nparticular use case you know that I\nparticular use case you know that I require transcript. So I will go ahead\nrequire transcript. So I will go ahead\nrequire transcript. So I will go ahead and create a transcript variable.\nand create a transcript variable.\nand create a transcript variable. As soon as this node is executed the\nAs soon as this node is executed the\nAs soon as this node is executed the output will be saved in this variable.\noutput will be saved in this variable.\noutput will be saved in this variable. Okay. So let me just go ahead and write\nOkay. So let me just go ahead and write\nOkay. So let me just go ahead and write it down over here. So state means what\nit down over here. So state means what\nit down over here. So state means what right? Whenever we define any kind of\nright? Whenever we define any kind of\nright? Whenever we define any kind of state\nstate\nstate our main aim is that whatever variables\nour main aim is that whatever variables\nour main aim is that whatever variables we define over here right. So let's say\nwe define over here right. So let's say\nwe define over here right. So let's say one of the variable I want to define is\none of the variable I want to define is\none of the variable I want to define is transcript because as soon as I execute\ntranscript because as soon as I execute\ntranscript because as soon as I execute this node my transcript will get\nthis node my transcript will get\nthis node my transcript will get generated right and this transcript will\ngenerated right and this transcript will\ngenerated right and this transcript will also be required in my third node. So\nalso be required in my third node. So\nalso be required in my third node. So what I can do when I create this state\nwhat I can do when I create this state\nwhat I can do when I create this state right this state will have one variable\nright this state will have one variable\nright this state will have one variable which will have the information about\nwhich will have the information about\nwhich will have the information about the transcript maintained. Okay.\nthe transcript maintained. Okay.\nthe transcript maintained. Okay. Similarly title is my third second\nSimilarly title is my third second\nSimilarly title is my third second output that I really want because here\noutput that I really want because here\noutput that I really want because here in this node I want to go ahead and save\nin this node I want to go ahead and save\nin this node I want to go ahead and save the title right. So here title\nthe title right. So here title\nthe title right. So here title information will be saved and then here\ninformation will be saved and then here\ninformation will be saved and then here you have content. So let's say that if I\nyou have content. So let's say that if I\nyou have content. So let's say that if I go ahead and create this three variables\ngo ahead and create this three variables\ngo ahead and create this three variables as soon as we generate those we can save\nas soon as we generate those we can save\nas soon as we generate those we can save in this right and the advantages of\nin this right and the advantages of\nin this right and the advantages of saving that values inside this state\nsaving that values inside this state\nsaving that values inside this state will be that inside this entire graph\nwill be that inside this entire graph\nwill be that inside this entire graph every node or any of these node will be\nevery node or any of these node will be\nevery node or any of these node will be able to access this variable. Okay. So\nable to access this variable. Okay. So\nable to access this variable. Okay. So that is the importance of state. Okay.\nthat is the importance of state. Okay.\nthat is the importance of state. Okay. And this entire graph we basically say\nAnd this entire graph we basically say\nAnd this entire graph we basically say it as state graph. So that is the reason\nit as state graph. So that is the reason\nit as state graph. So that is the reason we say it as state graph because it is\nwe say it as state graph because it is\nwe say it as state graph because it is able to maintain the context of the\nable to maintain the context of the\nable to maintain the context of the state at every node. Yes, don't get\nstate at every node. Yes, don't get\nstate at every node. Yes, don't get confused with external memory or memory.\nconfused with external memory or memory.\nconfused with external memory or memory. Right? So memory can also be used over\nRight? So memory can also be used over\nRight? So memory can also be used over here and that part we'll discuss in the\nhere and that part we'll discuss in the\nhere and that part we'll discuss in the later stages. But here we want to focus\nlater stages. But here we want to focus\nlater stages. But here we want to focus more on the state graph. State it is\nmore on the state graph. State it is\nmore on the state graph. State it is able to maintain the state within the\nable to maintain the state within the\nable to maintain the state within the specific nodes. Now I hope you got a\nspecific nodes. Now I hope you got a\nspecific nodes. Now I hope you got a clear idea about the components of lang\nclear idea about the components of lang\nclear idea about the components of lang graph. Now what we'll do? We will build\ngraph. Now what we'll do? We will build\ngraph. Now what we'll do? We will build a basic chatbot. In this basic chatbot\na basic chatbot. In this basic chatbot\na basic chatbot. In this basic chatbot what we'll do I will be having a start.\nwhat we'll do I will be having a start.\nwhat we'll do I will be having a start. From this start I will create one node.\nFrom this start I will create one node.\nFrom this start I will create one node. Let's say this particular node is\nLet's say this particular node is\nLet's say this particular node is nothing but chatbot. And from this we\nnothing but chatbot. And from this we\nnothing but chatbot. And from this we will go ahead and end it. Now this\nwill go ahead and end it. Now this\nwill go ahead and end it. Now this chatbot will be integrated with some\nchatbot will be integrated with some\nchatbot will be integrated with some kind of LLM press prompt\nkind of LLM press prompt\nkind of LLM press prompt and the work is take the input and give\nand the work is take the input and give\nand the work is take the input and give the output. Right? So this is the basic\nthe output. Right? So this is the basic\nthe output. Right? So this is the basic chatbot what we are going to build and\nchatbot what we are going to build and\nchatbot what we are going to build and as we go ahead you know we will go ahead\nas we go ahead you know we will go ahead\nas we go ahead you know we will go ahead and add tools external tools. We will go\nand add tools external tools. We will go\nand add tools external tools. We will go ahead and see that how we can integrate\nahead and see that how we can integrate\nahead and see that how we can integrate this external tools along with the\nthis external tools along with the\nthis external tools along with the chatbot. Then as we go ahead we'll again\nchatbot. Then as we go ahead we'll again\nchatbot. Then as we go ahead we'll again discuss about react agent. Okay. So\ndiscuss about react agent. Okay. So\ndiscuss about react agent. Okay. So react agent is something more amazing\nreact agent is something more amazing\nreact agent is something more amazing with respect to the tools. I know there\nwith respect to the tools. I know there\nwith respect to the tools. I know there are so many topics that we have\nare so many topics that we have\nare so many topics that we have discussed but let's now focus on\ndiscussed but let's now focus on\ndiscussed but let's now focus on understanding how to build this basic\nunderstanding how to build this basic\nunderstanding how to build this basic chatbot. So for this I will again go\nchatbot. So for this I will again go\nchatbot. So for this I will again go back to my code and now you have\nback to my code and now you have\nback to my code and now you have understood what is state graph. You have\nunderstood what is state graph. You have\nunderstood what is state graph. You have understood what exactly is nodes and\nunderstood what exactly is nodes and\nunderstood what exactly is nodes and what exactly is edges. Okay. Now step by\nwhat exactly is edges. Okay. Now step by\nwhat exactly is edges. Okay. Now step by step we will go ahead and do this. As\nstep we will go ahead and do this. As\nstep we will go ahead and do this. As usual, what we are going to do is that\nusual, what we are going to do is that\nusual, what we are going to do is that first of all, before starting building a\nfirst of all, before starting building a\nfirst of all, before starting building a chatbot using uh uh state graph or graph\nchatbot using uh uh state graph or graph\nchatbot using uh uh state graph or graph APIs, you know, first of all, we will go\nAPIs, you know, first of all, we will go\nAPIs, you know, first of all, we will go ahead and import some important\nahead and import some important\nahead and import some important libraries. Okay. So, one important\nlibraries. Okay. So, one important\nlibraries. Okay. So, one important library is something called as from\nlibrary is something called as from\nlibrary is something called as from typing import annotated. I'll talk about\ntyping import annotated. I'll talk about\ntyping import annotated. I'll talk about annotated.\nannotated.\nannotated. What exactly annotated is? It is just to\nWhat exactly annotated is? It is just to\nWhat exactly annotated is? It is just to add context specific metadata to a type.\nadd context specific metadata to a type.\nadd context specific metadata to a type. Okay. uh it is better that I show you an\nOkay. uh it is better that I show you an\nOkay. uh it is better that I show you an example in order to make you understand\nexample in order to make you understand\nexample in order to make you understand one more important library that I'm\none more important library that I'm\none more important library that I'm going to use is typing extension import\ngoing to use is typing extension import\ngoing to use is typing extension import type okay now along with this since you\ntype okay now along with this since you\ntype okay now along with this since you know that every graph starts with a\nknow that every graph starts with a\nknow that every graph starts with a start node and ends with the end node\nstart node and ends with the end node\nstart node and ends with the end node okay so for this I will go ahead and\nokay so for this I will go ahead and\nokay so for this I will go ahead and write from lang graph dot graph\nwrite from lang graph dot graph\nwrite from lang graph dot graph import\nimport\nimport state graph since we need to go ahead\nstate graph since we need to go ahead\nstate graph since we need to go ahead and also create a state graph state\nand also create a state graph state\nand also create a state graph state graph will be the entire graph right\ngraph will be the entire graph right\ngraph will be the entire graph right entire graph that you have seen over\nentire graph that you have seen over\nentire graph that you have seen over here. If I want to represent this entire\nhere. If I want to represent this entire\nhere. If I want to represent this entire graph, we can represent it with the help\ngraph, we can represent it with the help\ngraph, we can represent it with the help of state graph. Okay? And then comma\nof state graph. Okay? And then comma\nof state graph. Okay? And then comma start and then we will also have end.\nstart and then we will also have end.\nstart and then we will also have end. Okay. Start and end are just like my\nOkay. Start and end are just like my\nOkay. Start and end are just like my start node and end node. Along with this\nstart node and end node. Along with this\nstart node and end node. Along with this we will also go ahead and add from\nwe will also go ahead and add from\nwe will also go ahead and add from langraph dotgraph dot message import\nlangraph dotgraph dot message import\nlangraph dotgraph dot message import add\nmessages.\nmessages. Okay then let's go ahead and execute\nOkay then let's go ahead and execute\nOkay then let's go ahead and execute this. Okay now we have imported all the\nthis. Okay now we have imported all the\nthis. Okay now we have imported all the libraries. Now you may be thinking kish\nlibraries. Now you may be thinking kish\nlibraries. Now you may be thinking kish what exactly this add messages is. These\nwhat exactly this add messages is. These\nwhat exactly this add messages is. These are called as reducers. Okay. Now what\nare called as reducers. Okay. Now what\nare called as reducers. Okay. Now what is the importance of reducers? Okay, I\nis the importance of reducers? Okay, I\nis the importance of reducers? Okay, I will talk about it. Let's say that if I\nwill talk about it. Let's say that if I\nwill talk about it. Let's say that if I want to create this chatbot, right? If I\nwant to create this chatbot, right? If I\nwant to create this chatbot, right? If I want to create this chatbot, you know\nwant to create this chatbot, you know\nwant to create this chatbot, you know that we also have a state, right? Now in\nthat we also have a state, right? Now in\nthat we also have a state, right? Now in this state, what is the kind of variable\nthis state, what is the kind of variable\nthis state, what is the kind of variable that I really need to create so that any\nthat I really need to create so that any\nthat I really need to create so that any output that is generated by the chatbot\noutput that is generated by the chatbot\noutput that is generated by the chatbot will be saved it in one variable itself.\nwill be saved it in one variable itself.\nwill be saved it in one variable itself. So let's say that if I go ahead and\nSo let's say that if I go ahead and\nSo let's say that if I go ahead and create a variable called as messages\ncreate a variable called as messages\ncreate a variable called as messages inside this messages can I make this as\ninside this messages can I make this as\ninside this messages can I make this as a list type and inside this list as soon\na list type and inside this list as soon\na list type and inside this list as soon as I keep on asking any input\nas I keep on asking any input\nas I keep on asking any input automatically it should keep on getting\nautomatically it should keep on getting\nautomatically it should keep on getting appended. So again let me repeat it what\nappended. So again let me repeat it what\nappended. So again let me repeat it what I'm trying to say over here. Let's say\nI'm trying to say over here. Let's say\nI'm trying to say over here. Let's say if I'm creating this basic chatbot as\nif I'm creating this basic chatbot as\nif I'm creating this basic chatbot as soon as I give an input this should be\nsoon as I give an input this should be\nsoon as I give an input this should be able to generate an output. But again in\nable to generate an output. But again in\nable to generate an output. But again in that session if I give another input it\nthat session if I give another input it\nthat session if I give another input it this graph will again get executed and\nthis graph will again get executed and\nthis graph will again get executed and it'll give me the output right. So we\nit'll give me the output right. So we\nit'll give me the output right. So we can execute this graph as many number of\ncan execute this graph as many number of\ncan execute this graph as many number of times. Right? So when we are creating\ntimes. Right? So when we are creating\ntimes. Right? So when we are creating this state graph okay state graph so\nthis state graph okay state graph so\nthis state graph okay state graph so every conversation can I save that\nevery conversation can I save that\nevery conversation can I save that inside my state right which will be\ninside my state right which will be\ninside my state right which will be available to this particular node at any\navailable to this particular node at any\navailable to this particular node at any point of time yes. So for that what\npoint of time yes. So for that what\npoint of time yes. So for that what we'll do we'll we'll create one\nwe'll do we'll we'll create one\nwe'll do we'll we'll create one variable. We'll make it as a list type\nvariable. We'll make it as a list type\nvariable. We'll make it as a list type and inside this list we should keep on\nand inside this list we should keep on\nand inside this list we should keep on adding this messages. When I say adding\nadding this messages. When I say adding\nadding this messages. When I say adding it should be appending this messages. It\nit should be appending this messages. It\nit should be appending this messages. It should not replace the previous message.\nshould not replace the previous message.\nshould not replace the previous message. Okay. When I say replacing the previous\nOkay. When I say replacing the previous\nOkay. When I say replacing the previous message let's say in the first instance\nmessage let's say in the first instance\nmessage let's say in the first instance I had one message. I said hi how are\nI had one message. I said hi how are\nI had one message. I said hi how are you? Then the chatbot replied I am good.\nyou? Then the chatbot replied I am good.\nyou? Then the chatbot replied I am good. Then my next question is hey uh tell me\nThen my next question is hey uh tell me\nThen my next question is hey uh tell me what is your name? Then the chatbot\nwhat is your name? Then the chatbot\nwhat is your name? Then the chatbot replies hey I do not have any name I'm\nreplies hey I do not have any name I'm\nreplies hey I do not have any name I'm just a basic chatbot so this message\njust a basic chatbot so this message\njust a basic chatbot so this message should not get replaced instead it\nshould not get replaced instead it\nshould not get replaced instead it should get appended you know as every\nshould get appended you know as every\nshould get appended you know as every conversation goes ahead so that we will\nconversation goes ahead so that we will\nconversation goes ahead so that we will be able to maintain this information and\nbe able to maintain this information and\nbe able to maintain this information and that is the reason we say it as state\nthat is the reason we say it as state\nthat is the reason we say it as state graph okay so in order to probably\ngraph okay so in order to probably\ngraph okay so in order to probably append it we can use something called as\nappend it we can use something called as\nappend it we can use something called as reducers\nreducers\nreducers okay one of the example of the reducers\nokay one of the example of the reducers\nokay one of the example of the reducers there are different types of reducers\nthere are different types of reducers\nthere are different types of reducers that we can specifically use one of The\nthat we can specifically use one of The\nthat we can specifically use one of The red reducer is nothing but add messages.\nred reducer is nothing but add messages.\nred reducer is nothing but add messages. Now this add messages what it is going\nNow this add messages what it is going\nNow this add messages what it is going to do is that its work is only to add\nto do is that its work is only to add\nto do is that its work is only to add the messages instead of replacing in any\nthe messages instead of replacing in any\nthe messages instead of replacing in any kind of variable that we define. Okay.\nkind of variable that we define. Okay.\nkind of variable that we define. Okay. So now let me just go ahead and execute\nSo now let me just go ahead and execute\nSo now let me just go ahead and execute this. And now I will go ahead and start\nthis. And now I will go ahead and start\nthis. And now I will go ahead and start creating my state. So here I will write\ncreating my state. So here I will write\ncreating my state. So here I will write class state is equal to and here we are\nclass state is equal to and here we are\nclass state is equal to and here we are going to use this type dictionary. That\ngoing to use this type dictionary. That\ngoing to use this type dictionary. That basically means the state class is going\nbasically means the state class is going\nbasically means the state class is going to return type of a dictionary right. So\nto return type of a dictionary right. So\nto return type of a dictionary right. So here let me just go ahead and provide\nhere let me just go ahead and provide\nhere let me just go ahead and provide you some basic dock string so that you\nyou some basic dock string so that you\nyou some basic dock string so that you should be able to understand it as we go\nshould be able to understand it as we go\nshould be able to understand it as we go ahead. So here you can see messages have\nahead. So here you can see messages have\nahead. So here you can see messages have the type list. The add message function\nthe type list. The add message function\nthe type list. The add message function in the annotation defines how the state\nin the annotation defines how the state\nin the annotation defines how the state key should be updated. In this case it\nkey should be updated. In this case it\nkey should be updated. In this case it appends messages to the list rather than\nappends messages to the list rather than\nappends messages to the list rather than overwriting them. I hope everybody has\noverwriting them. I hope everybody has\noverwriting them. I hope everybody has understood why we are inheriting type\nunderstood why we are inheriting type\nunderstood why we are inheriting type deck because this state is going to\ndeck because this state is going to\ndeck because this state is going to return right this class is basically\nreturn right this class is basically\nreturn right this class is basically going to return of this type that is\ngoing to return of this type that is\ngoing to return of this type that is nothing but dictionary type right so if\nnothing but dictionary type right so if\nnothing but dictionary type right so if you see what is type dick it is a simple\nyou see what is type dick it is a simple\nyou see what is type dick it is a simple type name space at runtime it is\ntype name space at runtime it is\ntype name space at runtime it is equivalent to a plain dictionary right\nequivalent to a plain dictionary right\nequivalent to a plain dictionary right if I'm going and writing class point 2D\nif I'm going and writing class point 2D\nif I'm going and writing class point 2D type dick right so x is int y is int\ntype dick right so x is int y is int\ntype dick right so x is int y is int label is str so what we can do we can\nlabel is str so what we can do we can\nlabel is str so what we can do we can provide values in the form of\nprovide values in the form of\nprovide values in the form of dictionaries right key value pairs It's\ndictionaries right key value pairs It's\ndictionaries right key value pairs It's like x is equal to 1, y is equal to two,\nlike x is equal to 1, y is equal to two,\nlike x is equal to 1, y is equal to two, label is equal to good, right? Something\nlabel is equal to good, right? Something\nlabel is equal to good, right? Something like this. Now in the next step, what we\nlike this. Now in the next step, what we\nlike this. Now in the next step, what we are going to do is that we create one\nare going to do is that we create one\nare going to do is that we create one variable. Let's say messages. Inside\nvariable. Let's say messages. Inside\nvariable. Let's say messages. Inside this messages, we will go ahead and use\nthis messages, we will go ahead and use\nthis messages, we will go ahead and use annotated. Now annotated is just like a\nannotated. Now annotated is just like a\nannotated. Now annotated is just like a kind of label. Okay, this annotated\nkind of label. Okay, this annotated\nkind of label. Okay, this annotated class that we have inherited or we are\nclass that we have inherited or we are\nclass that we have inherited or we are basically writing it is nothing but it\nbasically writing it is nothing but it\nbasically writing it is nothing but it is it indicates the hypothetical runtime\nis it indicates the hypothetical runtime\nis it indicates the hypothetical runtime check model. This type is an unsigned\ncheck model. This type is an unsigned\ncheck model. This type is an unsigned integer. every other consumer of this\ninteger. every other consumer of this\ninteger. every other consumer of this type can ignore this metadata and treat\ntype can ignore this metadata and treat\ntype can ignore this metadata and treat this type as integer. So if you see some\nthis type as integer. So if you see some\nthis type as integer. So if you see some of the examples over here, you should\nof the examples over here, you should\nof the examples over here, you should definitely be able to understand these\ndefinitely be able to understand these\ndefinitely be able to understand these are something like in Python what\nare something like in Python what\nare something like in Python what exactly this basically means right now\nexactly this basically means right now\nexactly this basically means right now inside this I will say hey you have to\ninside this I will say hey you have to\ninside this I will say hey you have to go ahead and add the messages inside a\ngo ahead and add the messages inside a\ngo ahead and add the messages inside a list type with the help of add message.\nlist type with the help of add message.\nlist type with the help of add message. So this add message is called as a\nSo this add message is called as a\nSo this add message is called as a reducer. Please remember this\nreducer. Please remember this\nreducer. Please remember this information. When we say reducer, that\ninformation. When we say reducer, that\ninformation. When we say reducer, that basically means it is not going to\nbasically means it is not going to\nbasically means it is not going to replace this list with respect to every\nreplace this list with respect to every\nreplace this list with respect to every conversation we have. Instead, it is\nconversation we have. Instead, it is\nconversation we have. Instead, it is going to append. Append right. So here\ngoing to append. Append right. So here\ngoing to append. Append right. So here you can see that how this state key\nyou can see that how this state key\nyou can see that how this state key should be updated. In this case, it\nshould be updated. In this case, it\nshould be updated. In this case, it appends messages to the list rather than\nappends messages to the list rather than\nappends messages to the list rather than overwriting them. So this is the basic\noverwriting them. So this is the basic\noverwriting them. So this is the basic information. But I will show you how\ninformation. But I will show you how\ninformation. But I will show you how this looks like as we go ahead because\nthis looks like as we go ahead because\nthis looks like as we go ahead because we will go ahead and just display this\nwe will go ahead and just display this\nwe will go ahead and just display this with respect to the state. Now I will go\nwith respect to the state. Now I will go\nwith respect to the state. Now I will go ahead and build my graph. So in order to\nahead and build my graph. So in order to\nahead and build my graph. So in order to build my graph I'll say graph builder.\nbuild my graph I'll say graph builder.\nbuild my graph I'll say graph builder. I'll use the state graph and I'll give\nI'll use the state graph and I'll give\nI'll use the state graph and I'll give this class right. I'll give this class.\nthis class right. I'll give this class.\nthis class right. I'll give this class. That basically means when I give this\nThat basically means when I give this\nThat basically means when I give this specific class over here, this state\nspecific class over here, this state\nspecific class over here, this state graph uh when we are creating the entire\ngraph uh when we are creating the entire\ngraph uh when we are creating the entire graph uh at any point of time we can\ngraph uh at any point of time we can\ngraph uh at any point of time we can provide this specific information to our\nprovide this specific information to our\nprovide this specific information to our different different nodes. Okay, so this\ndifferent different nodes. Okay, so this\ndifferent different nodes. Okay, so this basically becomes my graph builder. Here\nbasically becomes my graph builder. Here\nbasically becomes my graph builder. Here I'm just going to go ahead and give show\nI'm just going to go ahead and give show\nI'm just going to go ahead and give show me my graph builder. It is nothing but\nme my graph builder. It is nothing but\nme my graph builder. It is nothing but it is of a type state graph. Okay, so my\nit is of a type state graph. Okay, so my\nit is of a type state graph. Okay, so my state information has got completed.\nstate information has got completed.\nstate information has got completed. Okay. Now in the next step what we are\nOkay. Now in the next step what we are\nOkay. Now in the next step what we are going to do is that we are going to\ngoing to do is that we are going to\ngoing to do is that we are going to build our entire graph itself. Right. We\nbuild our entire graph itself. Right. We\nbuild our entire graph itself. Right. We going to go ahead and build our entire\ngoing to go ahead and build our entire\ngoing to go ahead and build our entire graph. Okay. Now for this first of all\ngraph. Okay. Now for this first of all\ngraph. Okay. Now for this first of all what we are basically going to do is\nwhat we are basically going to do is\nwhat we are basically going to do is that I will go ahead and\nthat I will go ahead and\nthat I will go ahead and put one more libraries. So for this I\nput one more libraries. So for this I\nput one more libraries. So for this I will use python.env since we are going\nwill use python.env since we are going\nwill use python.env since we are going to go ahead and use uh you know uh grock\nto go ahead and use uh you know uh grock\nto go ahead and use uh you know uh grock models. You can use openAI models. You\nmodels. You can use openAI models. You\nmodels. You can use openAI models. You can use any kind of model. So here what\ncan use any kind of model. So here what\ncan use any kind of model. So here what I'm actually going to do I'll go ahead\nI'm actually going to do I'll go ahead\nI'm actually going to do I'll go ahead and write uv add uh minus r requirement\nand write uv add uh minus r requirement\nand write uv add uh minus r requirement txt. So once I go ahead and install this\ntxt. So once I go ahead and install this\ntxt. So once I go ahead and install this the installation has been done. Now once\nthe installation has been done. Now once\nthe installation has been done. Now once I go over here right so here you can see\nI go over here right so here you can see\nI go over here right so here you can see that um now we can go ahead and quickly\nthat um now we can go ahead and quickly\nthat um now we can go ahead and quickly import all the libraries that we want.\nimport all the libraries that we want.\nimport all the libraries that we want. So I will go ahead and write import OS\nSo I will go ahead and write import OS\nSo I will go ahead and write import OS then I will go ahead and write from lo\nthen I will go ahead and write from lo\nthen I will go ahead and write from lo from env\nfrom env\nfrom env import load env right and then we're\nimport load env right and then we're\nimport load env right and then we're going to go ahead and initialize this\ngoing to go ahead and initialize this\ngoing to go ahead and initialize this load env right so the reason why we are\nload env right so the reason why we are\nload env right so the reason why we are doing this is that whatever keys we\ndoing this is that whatever keys we\ndoing this is that whatever keys we specifically write in our enenv it\nspecifically write in our enenv it\nspecifically write in our enenv it should be able to load it so here I'm\nshould be able to load it so here I'm\nshould be able to load it so here I'm going to go ahead and create my env file\ngoing to go ahead and create my env file\ngoing to go ahead and create my env file right now with respect to the env um the\nright now with respect to the env um the\nright now with respect to the env um the Next step uh that we are going to\nNext step uh that we are going to\nNext step uh that we are going to specifically do is that whatever keys\nspecifically do is that whatever keys\nspecifically do is that whatever keys that we specifically want with respect\nthat we specifically want with respect\nthat we specifically want with respect to the gro API, we'll paste it over\nto the gro API, we'll paste it over\nto the gro API, we'll paste it over here. So this is my env. I hope\nhere. So this is my env. I hope\nhere. So this is my env. I hope everybody knows how to create a gro API\neverybody knows how to create a gro API\neverybody knows how to create a gro API key. In order to do that, just go to\nkey. In order to do that, just go to\nkey. In order to do that, just go to console.grock.\nconsole.grock.\nconsole.grock. Okay. So here you go to\nOkay. So here you go to\nOkay. So here you go to console.grock.com,\nright? And here you just go ahead and\nright? And here you just go ahead and create your API keys. You can go ahead\ncreate your API keys. You can go ahead\ncreate your API keys. You can go ahead and create your API key, write the API\nand create your API key, write the API\nand create your API key, write the API key name and start using it. Okay? So\nkey name and start using it. Okay? So\nkey name and start using it. Okay? So this API key we'll be using it and we\nthis API key we'll be using it and we\nthis API key we'll be using it and we can use different different\ncan use different different\ncan use different different um you know models LLM models in order\num you know models LLM models in order\num you know models LLM models in order to develop your generative AI\nto develop your generative AI\nto develop your generative AI applications. Okay. So once this is done\napplications. Okay. So once this is done\napplications. Okay. So once this is done I will quickly go ahead and again\nI will quickly go ahead and again\nI will quickly go ahead and again execute this since my env.\nSo first of all I will show you one very\nSo first of all I will show you one very easy way. So I will go ahead and write\neasy way. So I will go ahead and write\neasy way. So I will go ahead and write from langchain\nfrom langchain\nfrom langchain or\nor\nor sorry from langchain\nsorry from langchain\nsorry from langchain grock. Okay. So for this we need to\ngrock. Okay. So for this we need to\ngrock. Okay. So for this we need to install this library. It's called a lang\ninstall this library. It's called a lang\ninstall this library. It's called a lang grock. So I will go ahead and write\ngrock. So I will go ahead and write\ngrock. So I will go ahead and write lang chain\nlang chain\nlang chain gro. Okay. I will open my terminal\ngro. Okay. I will open my terminal\ngro. Okay. I will open my terminal requirement.txt. Now here you can see\nrequirement.txt. Now here you can see\nrequirement.txt. Now here you can see langchen gro has got installed and I\nlangchen gro has got installed and I\nlangchen gro has got installed and I will go ahead and minimize this. So from\nwill go ahead and minimize this. So from\nwill go ahead and minimize this. So from langun grock I will be importing chat\nlangun grock I will be importing chat\nlangun grock I will be importing chat gro. Okay. So this is one way you can\ngro. Okay. So this is one way you can\ngro. Okay. So this is one way you can directly initialize the gro model. The\ndirectly initialize the gro model. The\ndirectly initialize the gro model. The other way is more common and generic\nother way is more common and generic\nother way is more common and generic way. So where you can just give the\nway. So where you can just give the\nway. So where you can just give the model name and automatically it should\nmodel name and automatically it should\nmodel name and automatically it should be able to do it. So for that you will\nbe able to do it. So for that you will\nbe able to do it. So for that you will be using from langchain\nbe using from langchain\nbe using from langchain langchain um dot\nlangchain um dot\nlangchain um dot chat models\nchat models\nchat models import\nimport\nimport init chat model right so here if you\ninit chat model right so here if you\ninit chat model right so here if you want to directly go ahead and use your\nwant to directly go ahead and use your\nwant to directly go ahead and use your lm with the chat gro you can just go\nlm with the chat gro you can just go\nlm with the chat gro you can just go ahead and write like this and with\nahead and write like this and with\nahead and write like this and with respect to this you can just provide\nrespect to this you can just provide\nrespect to this you can just provide your uh model name okay so models it is\nyour uh model name okay so models it is\nyour uh model name okay so models it is up to you whatever models you\nup to you whatever models you\nup to you whatever models you specifically uh want to use or you want\nspecifically uh want to use or you want\nspecifically uh want to use or you want to go ahead with it, you know, you can\nto go ahead with it, you know, you can\nto go ahead with it, you know, you can definitely go ahead and just use that.\ndefinitely go ahead and just use that.\ndefinitely go ahead and just use that. Okay. See, at the end of the day, it's\nOkay. See, at the end of the day, it's\nOkay. See, at the end of the day, it's all about how you are using some\nall about how you are using some\nall about how you are using some specific models and which model you\nspecific models and which model you\nspecific models and which model you really want to use. Okay. So here, let's\nreally want to use. Okay. So here, let's\nreally want to use. Okay. So here, let's say that I want to go ahead with some\nsay that I want to go ahead with some\nsay that I want to go ahead with some other model, right? Uh for this, I will\nother model, right? Uh for this, I will\nother model, right? Uh for this, I will again open my let's see my playground is\nagain open my let's see my playground is\nagain open my let's see my playground is over here. So let's say I will be using\nover here. So let's say I will be using\nover here. So let's say I will be using some models like llama 3 8 billion8192.\nsome models like llama 3 8 billion8192.\nsome models like llama 3 8 billion8192. So here all you have to do is that you\nSo here all you have to do is that you\nSo here all you have to do is that you have to go ahead and give your model is\nhave to go ahead and give your model is\nhave to go ahead and give your model is equal to uh lama 3\nequal to uh lama 3\nequal to uh lama 3 lama 3\nlama 3\nlama 3 is the names correct 8b\nis the names correct 8b\nis the names correct 8b 8b 8192 right so you can basically give\n8b 8192 right so you can basically give\n8b 8192 right so you can basically give this particular model and if you execute\nthis particular model and if you execute\nthis particular model and if you execute it this is nothing but this becomes your\nit this is nothing but this becomes your\nit this is nothing but this becomes your llm right this becomes your llm right\nllm right this becomes your llm right\nllm right this becomes your llm right you can either initialize in this way or\nyou can either initialize in this way or\nyou can either initialize in this way or you can also directly go ahead and write\nyou can also directly go ahead and write\nyou can also directly go ahead and write something like this so here I'll be\nsomething like this so here I'll be\nsomething like this so here I'll be using llama llm\nusing llama llm\nusing llama llm Initiate chat model. Here we are going\nInitiate chat model. Here we are going\nInitiate chat model. Here we are going to give the model name. The model name\nto give the model name. The model name\nto give the model name. The model name will start with something like this.\nwill start with something like this.\nwill start with something like this. Grock colon you know llama 3\nGrock colon you know llama 3\nGrock colon you know llama 3 8 billion 9 sorry 8192. Okay. So here\n8 billion 9 sorry 8192. Okay. So here\n8 billion 9 sorry 8192. Okay. So here also you can use this and it'll also\nalso you can use this and it'll also\nalso you can use this and it'll also give you the same llm right. So these\ngive you the same llm right. So these\ngive you the same llm right. So these are both ways how you can initialize\nare both ways how you can initialize\nare both ways how you can initialize this. Uh and again if you are using\nthis. Uh and again if you are using\nthis. Uh and again if you are using OpenAI then you can use uh Langchain\nOpenAI then you can use uh Langchain\nOpenAI then you can use uh Langchain OpenAI and here you can just mention\nOpenAI and here you can just mention\nOpenAI and here you can just mention OpenAI colon whatever OpenAI model name\nOpenAI colon whatever OpenAI model name\nOpenAI colon whatever OpenAI model name you are specifically going to use. Okay\nyou are specifically going to use. Okay\nyou are specifically going to use. Okay now this is my LLM. So here if I go back\nnow this is my LLM. So here if I go back\nnow this is my LLM. So here if I go back to my graph right we have created our\nto my graph right we have created our\nto my graph right we have created our LLM. Our LLM is ready. Now we will go\nLLM. Our LLM is ready. Now we will go\nLLM. Our LLM is ready. Now we will go ahead and create this chatbot. The\nahead and create this chatbot. The\nahead and create this chatbot. The chatbot is nothing but it is just like a\nchatbot is nothing but it is just like a\nchatbot is nothing but it is just like a node right now with for every node you\nnode right now with for every node you\nnode right now with for every node you need to create a node definition. Right?\nneed to create a node definition. Right?\nneed to create a node definition. Right? So in order to create a node definition,\nSo in order to create a node definition,\nSo in order to create a node definition, I will go ahead and write definition\nI will go ahead and write definition\nI will go ahead and write definition chatbot. Let's say this is my node. And\nchatbot. Let's say this is my node. And\nchatbot. Let's say this is my node. And here uh here I'm going to go ahead and\nhere uh here I'm going to go ahead and\nhere uh here I'm going to go ahead and define my state colon state. Okay. And\ndefine my state colon state. Okay. And\ndefine my state colon state. Okay. And here what I'm actually going to do is\nhere what I'm actually going to do is\nhere what I'm actually going to do is that I'll go ahead and write return\nthat I'll go ahead and write return\nthat I'll go ahead and write return messages\nmessages\nmessages colon. Now see this\ncolon. Now see this\ncolon. Now see this since this why I'm returning in this\nsince this why I'm returning in this\nsince this why I'm returning in this particular variable because whenever I\nparticular variable because whenever I\nparticular variable because whenever I define this chatbot right it should be\ndefine this chatbot right it should be\ndefine this chatbot right it should be inheriting this state because at the end\ninheriting this state because at the end\ninheriting this state because at the end of the day I need to keep on appending\nof the day I need to keep on appending\nof the day I need to keep on appending inside this particular variable right\ninside this particular variable right\ninside this particular variable right and you know the state return type is\nand you know the state return type is\nand you know the state return type is type dictionary so that is the reason we\ntype dictionary so that is the reason we\ntype dictionary so that is the reason we are inheriting over here state colon\nare inheriting over here state colon\nare inheriting over here state colon state and when we write return message\nstate and when we write return message\nstate and when we write return message colon here we are going to invoke it\ncolon here we are going to invoke it\ncolon here we are going to invoke it with our llm. So here I'm going to go\nwith our llm. So here I'm going to go\nwith our llm. So here I'm going to go ahead and write llm.invoke\nahead and write llm.invoke\nahead and write llm.invoke and with respect to the invoke here\nand with respect to the invoke here\nand with respect to the invoke here we're going to use the state of\nwe're going to use the state of\nwe're going to use the state of messages.\nmessages.\nmessages. Okay, state of messages. So we are going\nOkay, state of messages. So we are going\nOkay, state of messages. So we are going to basically go ahead and return this uh\nto basically go ahead and return this uh\nto basically go ahead and return this uh to give you a very brief understanding.\nto give you a very brief understanding.\nto give you a very brief understanding. This is what is my node functionality is\nThis is what is my node functionality is\nThis is what is my node functionality is okay this is what is my node\nokay this is what is my node\nokay this is what is my node functionality. Here we have defined a\nfunctionality. Here we have defined a\nfunctionality. Here we have defined a node called as chatbot. This llm.invoke\nnode called as chatbot. This llm.invoke\nnode called as chatbot. This llm.invoke Invoke is basically giving right based\nInvoke is basically giving right based\nInvoke is basically giving right based on this input message. See the state of\non this input message. See the state of\non this input message. See the state of messages is what it will be my input\nmessages is what it will be my input\nmessages is what it will be my input message right as soon as we get an input\nmessage right as soon as we get an input\nmessage right as soon as we get an input message we are giving to our chatbot\nmessage we are giving to our chatbot\nmessage we are giving to our chatbot node and that chatbot node is going to\nnode and that chatbot node is going to\nnode and that chatbot node is going to provide the response from this from my\nprovide the response from this from my\nprovide the response from this from my llm and it will append inside this\nllm and it will append inside this\nllm and it will append inside this messages variable. This messages\nmessages variable. This messages\nmessages variable. This messages variable is nothing but it is the same\nvariable is nothing but it is the same\nvariable is nothing but it is the same variable that we defined in the class\nvariable that we defined in the class\nvariable that we defined in the class state. Okay. Now this is done. Now in my\nstate. Okay. Now this is done. Now in my\nstate. Okay. Now this is done. Now in my next step what we are basically going to\nnext step what we are basically going to\nnext step what we are basically going to do is that we are going to go ahead and\ndo is that we are going to go ahead and\ndo is that we are going to go ahead and quickly start building our graph. So for\nquickly start building our graph. So for\nquickly start building our graph. So for this we will be using our graph builder.\nthis we will be using our graph builder.\nthis we will be using our graph builder. If you remember uh what is graph\nIf you remember uh what is graph\nIf you remember uh what is graph builder? So graph builder is nothing but\nbuilder? So graph builder is nothing but\nbuilder? So graph builder is nothing but it's my state graph. So I will just\nit's my state graph. So I will just\nit's my state graph. So I will just remove this quickly over here and I'll\nremove this quickly over here and I'll\nremove this quickly over here and I'll just paste it over here itself. Okay. So\njust paste it over here itself. Okay. So\njust paste it over here itself. Okay. So this is my graph builder and uh with\nthis is my graph builder and uh with\nthis is my graph builder and uh with respect to the graph builder how we need\nrespect to the graph builder how we need\nrespect to the graph builder how we need to build it. Right. In my graph builder\nto build it. Right. In my graph builder\nto build it. Right. In my graph builder I have to have one chatbot node, one\nI have to have one chatbot node, one\nI have to have one chatbot node, one start and one end. Right? And there\nstart and one end. Right? And there\nstart and one end. Right? And there should be edges connected to both of\nshould be edges connected to both of\nshould be edges connected to both of them. And as I told you that we are\nthem. And as I told you that we are\nthem. And as I told you that we are going to use the graph API. Right? So uh\ngoing to use the graph API. Right? So uh\ngoing to use the graph API. Right? So uh for this what I'm actually going to do\nfor this what I'm actually going to do\nfor this what I'm actually going to do is that I'm quickly going to write graph\nis that I'm quickly going to write graph\nis that I'm quickly going to write graph builder dot add node. Okay. So this will\nbuilder dot add node. Okay. So this will\nbuilder dot add node. Okay. So this will basically be my first node. My first\nbasically be my first node. My first\nbasically be my first node. My first node name will be chatbot. You can\nnode name will be chatbot. You can\nnode name will be chatbot. You can mention anything. Let's say I will go\nmention anything. Let's say I will go\nmention anything. Let's say I will go ahead and write llm chatbot. Okay. But\nahead and write llm chatbot. Okay. But\nahead and write llm chatbot. Okay. But the second parameter that I'm going to\nthe second parameter that I'm going to\nthe second parameter that I'm going to write is about my node definition. So\nwrite is about my node definition. So\nwrite is about my node definition. So which is nothing but chatbot. Right? So\nwhich is nothing but chatbot. Right? So\nwhich is nothing but chatbot. Right? So this every node will have some node\nthis every node will have some node\nthis every node will have some node implementation. That node implementation\nimplementation. That node implementation\nimplementation. That node implementation you should be specifying it over here.\nyou should be specifying it over here.\nyou should be specifying it over here. Okay. Then uh coming to the next uh\nOkay. Then uh coming to the next uh\nOkay. Then uh coming to the next uh option is that in my graph right I\noption is that in my graph right I\noption is that in my graph right I definitely have only one node right this\ndefinitely have only one node right this\ndefinitely have only one node right this is the node that is there. But along\nis the node that is there. But along\nis the node that is there. But along with this I will go ahead and create\nwith this I will go ahead and create\nwith this I will go ahead and create start and end as my starting and end\nstart and end as my starting and end\nstart and end as my starting and end point right. So in order to create that\npoint right. So in order to create that\npoint right. So in order to create that we need to go ahead and create edges\nwe need to go ahead and create edges\nwe need to go ahead and create edges right. So first of all uh what we\nright. So first of all uh what we\nright. So first of all uh what we basically going to do is that I'll go\nbasically going to do is that I'll go\nbasically going to do is that I'll go ahead and write graph builder dot add\nahead and write graph builder dot add\nahead and write graph builder dot add edge. So this was my adding node.\nedge. So this was my adding node.\nedge. So this was my adding node. Adding nodes\nAdding nodes\nAdding nodes this is my adding edges.\nthis is my adding edges.\nthis is my adding edges. Add edges. Now with respect to add edges\nAdd edges. Now with respect to add edges\nAdd edges. Now with respect to add edges and add node here is my start. So from\nand add node here is my start. So from\nand add node here is my start. So from the start I have to go to my LLM chatbot\nthe start I have to go to my LLM chatbot\nthe start I have to go to my LLM chatbot right. So from my start I'm going to the\nright. So from my start I'm going to the\nright. So from my start I'm going to the LLM chatbot and from the LLM chatbot I\nLLM chatbot and from the LLM chatbot I\nLLM chatbot and from the LLM chatbot I should basically go where to the end\nshould basically go where to the end\nshould basically go where to the end right? So I will go ahead and add one\nright? So I will go ahead and add one\nright? So I will go ahead and add one more edge and this edge is going from\nmore edge and this edge is going from\nmore edge and this edge is going from llm chatbot\nllm chatbot\nllm chatbot llm chatbot and remember here you need\nllm chatbot and remember here you need\nllm chatbot and remember here you need to specify the node name instead of a\nto specify the node name instead of a\nto specify the node name instead of a node functionality right and this will\nnode functionality right and this will\nnode functionality right and this will basically go to my end node. Okay,\nbasically go to my end node. Okay,\nbasically go to my end node. Okay, perfect. Now see that is what it is\nperfect. Now see that is what it is\nperfect. Now see that is what it is matching right from start I have created\nmatching right from start I have created\nmatching right from start I have created an edge to chatbot then again it is\nan edge to chatbot then again it is\nan edge to chatbot then again it is going to the end. So this is my entire\ngoing to the end. So this is my entire\ngoing to the end. So this is my entire graph right. Finally what we do is that\ngraph right. Finally what we do is that\ngraph right. Finally what we do is that we compile the graph. So these are some\nwe compile the graph. So these are some\nwe compile the graph. So these are some of the steps when we define the graph.\nof the steps when we define the graph.\nof the steps when we define the graph. The compilation is necessary so that we\nThe compilation is necessary so that we\nThe compilation is necessary so that we can execute the graph. Right? Unless and\ncan execute the graph. Right? Unless and\ncan execute the graph. Right? Unless and until the graph is not compiled you will\nuntil the graph is not compiled you will\nuntil the graph is not compiled you will not be able to execute it. Right? So for\nnot be able to execute it. Right? So for\nnot be able to execute it. Right? So for this I will go ahead and use graph\nthis I will go ahead and use graph\nthis I will go ahead and use graph builder dot compile. And here we are\nbuilder dot compile. And here we are\nbuilder dot compile. And here we are basically going to just go ahead and\nbasically going to just go ahead and\nbasically going to just go ahead and execute it. Okay. Now the question rises\nexecute it. Okay. Now the question rises\nexecute it. Okay. Now the question rises can we go ahead and see how this graph\ncan we go ahead and see how this graph\ncan we go ahead and see how this graph looks like? Okay. Yes. Obviously you can\nlooks like? Okay. Yes. Obviously you can\nlooks like? Okay. Yes. Obviously you can see it. So for this we will be using\nsee it. So for this we will be using\nsee it. So for this we will be using some visualization graph. So I will just\nsome visualization graph. So I will just\nsome visualization graph. So I will just go ahead and write visualize the graph.\ngo ahead and write visualize the graph.\ngo ahead and write visualize the graph. Okay. So from visualization graph I will\nOkay. So from visualization graph I will\nOkay. So from visualization graph I will go ahead and write from I python\ngo ahead and write from I python\ngo ahead and write from I python dot\ndot\ndot display\ndisplay\ndisplay okay import image comma display okay so\nokay import image comma display okay so\nokay import image comma display okay so we are going to use this and uh again\nwe are going to use this and uh again\nwe are going to use this and uh again we're going to go ahead and use try\nwe're going to go ahead and use try\nwe're going to go ahead and use try catch block where we're going to use\ncatch block where we're going to use\ncatch block where we're going to use this display method which is responsible\nthis display method which is responsible\nthis display method which is responsible in displaying the graph with respect to\nin displaying the graph with respect to\nin displaying the graph with respect to any image object that you give and if I\nany image object that you give and if I\nany image object that you give and if I go ahead and write graph get graph I\ngo ahead and write graph get graph I\ngo ahead and write graph get graph I should be able to get the graph itself\nshould be able to get the graph itself\nshould be able to get the graph itself and this we will try to draw it in some\nand this we will try to draw it in some\nand this we will try to draw it in some mermaid png. Okay, these are some of the\nmermaid png. Okay, these are some of the\nmermaid png. Okay, these are some of the functionalities that were provided over\nfunctionalities that were provided over\nfunctionalities that were provided over there in the documentation. So I'll go\nthere in the documentation. So I'll go\nthere in the documentation. So I'll go ahead and write except exception. Okay,\nahead and write except exception. Okay,\nahead and write except exception. Okay, and here I can just go ahead and write\nand here I can just go ahead and write\nand here I can just go ahead and write pass. So here you can see this is how my\npass. So here you can see this is how my\npass. So here you can see this is how my chatbot looks like. So here I have\nchatbot looks like. So here I have\nchatbot looks like. So here I have start, this is my LLM chatbot and this\nstart, this is my LLM chatbot and this\nstart, this is my LLM chatbot and this is my end, right? So when I give my\nis my end, right? So when I give my\nis my end, right? So when I give my input from here, my llm my start will be\ninput from here, my llm my start will be\ninput from here, my llm my start will be sending this and I should be able to get\nsending this and I should be able to get\nsending this and I should be able to get this. Okay. Now the time is that how do\nthis. Okay. Now the time is that how do\nthis. Okay. Now the time is that how do we run this? You know we we really need\nwe run this? You know we we really need\nwe run this? You know we we really need to run this right at any point of time\nto run this right at any point of time\nto run this right at any point of time and if you are running it how does it\nand if you are running it how does it\nand if you are running it how does it basically looks like you know so for\nbasically looks like you know so for\nbasically looks like you know so for this I can directly use this graph dot\nthis I can directly use this graph dot\nthis I can directly use this graph dot invoke. Okay. And I will say hey u hi.\ninvoke. Okay. And I will say hey u hi.\ninvoke. Okay. And I will say hey u hi. So let's say this is the message that\nSo let's say this is the message that\nSo let's say this is the message that I'm giving. So what will happen? Hi will\nI'm giving. So what will happen? Hi will\nI'm giving. So what will happen? Hi will go from here. it'll go to the LLM\ngo from here. it'll go to the LLM\ngo from here. it'll go to the LLM chatbot. It'll give you the output and\nchatbot. It'll give you the output and\nchatbot. It'll give you the output and it'll end. That's it. Right? So when I\nit'll end. That's it. Right? So when I\nit'll end. That's it. Right? So when I say hi uh\nsay hi uh\nsay hi uh got hi. Okay. So one problem over here\ngot hi. Okay. So one problem over here\ngot hi. Okay. So one problem over here that you'll be able to see that uh when\nthat you'll be able to see that uh when\nthat you'll be able to see that uh when it is trying to retrieve the details\nit is trying to retrieve the details\nit is trying to retrieve the details there we are facing some kind of\nthere we are facing some kind of\nthere we are facing some kind of problems. Okay. Now what is the exact\nproblems. Okay. Now what is the exact\nproblems. Okay. Now what is the exact problem that we are facing? I will just\nproblem that we are facing? I will just\nproblem that we are facing? I will just try to uh resolve this uh as we go ahead\ntry to uh resolve this uh as we go ahead\ntry to uh resolve this uh as we go ahead you know. So let's go ahead and do this.\nyou know. So let's go ahead and do this.\nyou know. So let's go ahead and do this. So here one very important thing is that\nSo here one very important thing is that\nSo here one very important thing is that in the state you remember that what is\nin the state you remember that what is\nin the state you remember that what is the variable that we created right\nthe variable that we created right\nthe variable that we created right messages. So what I will do I will go\nmessages. So what I will do I will go\nmessages. So what I will do I will go ahead and create a dictionary called as\nahead and create a dictionary called as\nahead and create a dictionary called as messages. And now inside this I will\nmessages. And now inside this I will\nmessages. And now inside this I will give my message saying as hi before I\ngive my message saying as hi before I\ngive my message saying as hi before I had not given this. So it is not able to\nhad not given this. So it is not able to\nhad not given this. So it is not able to pick it up right because here if you see\npick it up right because here if you see\npick it up right because here if you see inside my functionality of LLM chatbot\ninside my functionality of LLM chatbot\ninside my functionality of LLM chatbot it is invoking from this particular\nit is invoking from this particular\nit is invoking from this particular variable right from state of messages\nvariable right from state of messages\nvariable right from state of messages where it is basically saved right so\nwhere it is basically saved right so\nwhere it is basically saved right so here now let's go ahead and execute this\nhere now let's go ahead and execute this\nhere now let's go ahead and execute this now it should execute it let's see\nnow it should execute it let's see\nnow it should execute it let's see invalid API key\ninvalid API key\ninvalid API key during the task okay so my env\nduring the task okay so my env\nduring the task okay so my env is ready okay no worries see the problem\nis ready okay no worries see the problem\nis ready okay no worries see the problem over here is that we need to restart the\nover here is that we need to restart the\nover here is that we need to restart the kernel because my API key I added it in\nkernel because my API key I added it in\nkernel because my API key I added it in the later stages right so that is the\nthe later stages right so that is the\nthe later stages right so that is the reason so quickly I will execute all\nreason so quickly I will execute all\nreason so quickly I will execute all these things sorry graph builder is not\nthese things sorry graph builder is not\nthese things sorry graph builder is not required over here\nrequired over here\nrequired over here now it should execute it because I just\nnow it should execute it because I just\nnow it should execute it because I just needed to reload this you know by\nneeded to reload this you know by\nneeded to reload this you know by restarting my kernel then only it'll get\nrestarting my kernel then only it'll get\nrestarting my kernel then only it'll get reloaded okay no worries now it should\nreloaded okay no worries now it should\nreloaded okay no worries now it should work\nso my visualization graph is there and\nso my visualization graph is there and now I'm invoking the messages of high.\nnow I'm invoking the messages of high.\nnow I'm invoking the messages of high. Now here you can see that I have got\nNow here you can see that I have got\nNow here you can see that I have got graph.invoke messages of high human\ngraph.invoke messages of high human\ngraph.invoke messages of high human message. Now you see this high that is\nmessage. Now you see this high that is\nmessage. Now you see this high that is going right. It is being treated as a\ngoing right. It is being treated as a\ngoing right. It is being treated as a human message. And now your response is\nhuman message. And now your response is\nhuman message. And now your response is with respect to the AI message. Hi, it's\nwith respect to the AI message. Hi, it's\nwith respect to the AI message. Hi, it's nice to meet you. So let's go ahead and\nnice to meet you. So let's go ahead and\nnice to meet you. So let's go ahead and save this as my response. Okay. Now in\nsave this as my response. Okay. Now in\nsave this as my response. Okay. Now in order to check the response, right? What\norder to check the response, right? What\norder to check the response, right? What was the final response here? You can see\nwas the final response here? You can see\nwas the final response here? You can see that I can go ahead and read inside my\nthat I can go ahead and read inside my\nthat I can go ahead and read inside my messages variable. Now this is what is\nmessages variable. Now this is what is\nmessages variable. Now this is what is really important. See inside my class\nreally important. See inside my class\nreally important. See inside my class state right I told you that we are going\nstate right I told you that we are going\nstate right I told you that we are going to create a variable right over here\nto create a variable right over here\nto create a variable right over here this is my messages variable annotated\nthis is my messages variable annotated\nthis is my messages variable annotated was there list was there and add message\nwas there list was there and add message\nwas there list was there and add message was there this add messages is acting as\nwas there this add messages is acting as\nwas there this add messages is acting as a reducer\na reducer\na reducer reducer work is to append inside this\nreducer work is to append inside this\nreducer work is to append inside this list see initially human gave high then\nlist see initially human gave high then\nlist see initially human gave high then AI message gave high right and this has\nAI message gave high right and this has\nAI message gave high right and this has got added inside this list understand\ngot added inside this list understand\ngot added inside this list understand one very very important thing And this\none very very important thing And this\none very very important thing And this is in the messages variable. Right? Now\nis in the messages variable. Right? Now\nis in the messages variable. Right? Now you may be thinking what is this\nyou may be thinking what is this\nyou may be thinking what is this annotated? Annotated basically means\nannotated? Annotated basically means\nannotated? Annotated basically means what? As soon as I gave hi. See over\nwhat? As soon as I gave hi. See over\nwhat? As soon as I gave hi. See over here automatically this messages got\nhere automatically this messages got\nhere automatically this messages got converted to human message. Right? Human\nconverted to human message. Right? Human\nconverted to human message. Right? Human message is just like one kind of\nmessage is just like one kind of\nmessage is just like one kind of annotation. We uh the the the the the\nannotation. We uh the the the the the\nannotation. We uh the the the the the graph is making sure that it is\ngraph is making sure that it is\ngraph is making sure that it is annotating and it is appending in this\nannotating and it is appending in this\nannotating and it is appending in this specific list. And the reason it is\nspecific list. And the reason it is\nspecific list. And the reason it is getting appended because here you can\ngetting appended because here you can\ngetting appended because here you can see that directly that my messages are\nsee that directly that my messages are\nsee that directly that my messages are getting appended with the help of those\ngetting appended with the help of those\ngetting appended with the help of those reducers itself add messages itself.\nreducers itself add messages itself.\nreducers itself add messages itself. Right? Now I hope you are able to\nRight? Now I hope you are able to\nRight? Now I hope you are able to understand it right why we have\nunderstand it right why we have\nunderstand it right why we have specifically defined it. Now the\nspecifically defined it. Now the\nspecifically defined it. Now the question rises how do I go ahead and\nquestion rises how do I go ahead and\nquestion rises how do I go ahead and retrieve the last message? It is nothing\nretrieve the last message? It is nothing\nretrieve the last message? It is nothing but response of message minus one. Okay.\nbut response of message minus one. Okay.\nbut response of message minus one. Okay. So here you can see that I have got this\nSo here you can see that I have got this\nSo here you can see that I have got this and if you just go ahead and write dot\nand if you just go ahead and write dot\nand if you just go ahead and write dot content you should be able to get hi\ncontent you should be able to get hi\ncontent you should be able to get hi it's nice to meet you. Is there\nit's nice to meet you. Is there\nit's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with? Okay, so\nsomething I can help you with? Okay, so\nsomething I can help you with? Okay, so this is the most easiest way of probably\nthis is the most easiest way of probably\nthis is the most easiest way of probably uh reading all the stuffs. Okay, now\nuh reading all the stuffs. Okay, now\nuh reading all the stuffs. Okay, now there are two more way of streaming it,\nthere are two more way of streaming it,\nthere are two more way of streaming it, right? Streaming your specific data or\nright? Streaming your specific data or\nright? Streaming your specific data or or running your entire graph and uh you\nor running your entire graph and uh you\nor running your entire graph and uh you know displaying the information, right?\nknow displaying the information, right?\nknow displaying the information, right? So that is what we will discuss now and\nSo that is what we will discuss now and\nSo that is what we will discuss now and understand one thing guys if you are\nunderstand one thing guys if you are\nunderstand one thing guys if you are able to understand this right trust me\nable to understand this right trust me\nable to understand this right trust me as you go ahead any kind of graph any\nas you go ahead any kind of graph any\nas you go ahead any kind of graph any kind of complex workflow that you have\nkind of complex workflow that you have\nkind of complex workflow that you have in your mind you should be able to\nin your mind you should be able to\nin your mind you should be able to execute it okay now what I will do I\nexecute it okay now what I will do I\nexecute it okay now what I will do I will go ahead and write for event\nwill go ahead and write for event\nwill go ahead and write for event in graph dot stream okay so this time\nin graph dot stream okay so this time\nin graph dot stream okay so this time instead of directly using graph.invoke\ninstead of directly using graph.invoke\ninstead of directly using graph.invoke invoke I am using something called as\ninvoke I am using something called as\ninvoke I am using something called as graph stream we will understand about\ngraph stream we will understand about\ngraph stream we will understand about this as we go ahead but I just want to\nthis as we go ahead but I just want to\nthis as we go ahead but I just want to give you some kind of information how\ngive you some kind of information how\ngive you some kind of information how things work in this so now here I will\nthings work in this so now here I will\nthings work in this so now here I will give you messages okay and colon let's\ngive you messages okay and colon let's\ngive you messages okay and colon let's say here I go ahead and give hi\nsay here I go ahead and give hi\nsay here I go ahead and give hi how are you okay so this is what is my\nhow are you okay so this is what is my\nhow are you okay so this is what is my message let's see whether everything\nmessage let's see whether everything\nmessage let's see whether everything looks fine uh yeah this is my for loop\nlooks fine uh yeah this is my for loop\nlooks fine uh yeah this is my for loop yeah now what I'm actually going to do I\nyeah now what I'm actually going to do I\nyeah now what I'm actually going to do I will just go ahead and write print\nwill just go ahead and write print\nwill just go ahead and write print event. Okay. Now let's execute this. So\nevent. Okay. Now let's execute this. So\nevent. Okay. Now let's execute this. So here you can see that inside this I have\nhere you can see that inside this I have\nhere you can see that inside this I have got an output which looks something like\ngot an output which looks something like\ngot an output which looks something like this AI messages messages AI message all\nthis AI messages messages AI message all\nthis AI messages messages AI message all these information and I'm getting this\nthese information and I'm getting this\nthese information and I'm getting this right now when I am doing graph stream\nright now when I am doing graph stream\nright now when I am doing graph stream with this particular input right so here\nwith this particular input right so here\nwith this particular input right so here I'm getting with llm chart lm chart is\nI'm getting with llm chart lm chart is\nI'm getting with llm chart lm chart is nothing but my uh node which you are\nnothing but my uh node which you are\nnothing but my uh node which you are able to see this okay now let's say that\nable to see this okay now let's say that\nable to see this okay now let's say that I will go ahead and write one more for\nI will go ahead and write one more for\nI will go ahead and write one more for loop I'll write for event or so for\nloop I'll write for event or so for\nloop I'll write for event or so for value\nvalue\nvalue in event dot values\nin event dot values\nin event dot values event dot\nevent dot\nevent dot values now what will happen if I just go\nvalues now what will happen if I just go\nvalues now what will happen if I just go ahead and print this okay see I will\nahead and print this okay see I will\nahead and print this okay see I will print my value\nprint my value\nprint my value now if I execute this here you can see\nnow if I execute this here you can see\nnow if I execute this here you can see that I'm getting this AI message right\nthat I'm getting this AI message right\nthat I'm getting this AI message right so that basically means now whenever we\nso that basically means now whenever we\nso that basically means now whenever we try to stream from this graph stream and\ntry to stream from this graph stream and\ntry to stream from this graph stream and whenever we try to see the event values\nwhenever we try to see the event values\nwhenever we try to see the event values only AI messages will be getting\nonly AI messages will be getting\nonly AI messages will be getting displayed Right now in order to display\ndisplayed Right now in order to display\ndisplayed Right now in order to display this what I can basically do is that I\nthis what I can basically do is that I\nthis what I can basically do is that I can also go ahead and write value of\ncan also go ahead and write value of\ncan also go ahead and write value of messages\nmessages\nmessages uh which will be my last message minus\nuh which will be my last message minus\nuh which will be my last message minus one and here I'll just use dot content\none and here I'll just use dot content\none and here I'll just use dot content and this will basically display the same\nand this will basically display the same\nand this will basically display the same thing like what it was displayed over\nthing like what it was displayed over\nthing like what it was displayed over here right hi I'm just language model so\nhere right hi I'm just language model so\nhere right hi I'm just language model so I don't have feelings or like human do\nI don't have feelings or like human do\nI don't have feelings or like human do and all this is just one specific\nand all this is just one specific\nand all this is just one specific example I've told about streaming but\nexample I've told about streaming but\nexample I've told about streaming but don't worry because this streaming we\ndon't worry because this streaming we\ndon't worry because this streaming we will discuss more about it there are\nwill discuss more about it there are\nwill discuss more about it there are multiple types of streaming. With\nmultiple types of streaming. With\nmultiple types of streaming. With respect to streamings, you can also\nrespect to streamings, you can also\nrespect to streamings, you can also provide different different parameters\nprovide different different parameters\nprovide different different parameters what exactly it means, you know. So, we\nwhat exactly it means, you know. So, we\nwhat exactly it means, you know. So, we will discuss about it as we go ahead.\nwill discuss about it as we go ahead.\nwill discuss about it as we go ahead. But here this was just an example of how\nBut here this was just an example of how\nBut here this was just an example of how you can go ahead and build a basic\nyou can go ahead and build a basic\nyou can go ahead and build a basic chatbot. Okay. Now, it's time that we\nchatbot. Okay. Now, it's time that we\nchatbot. Okay. Now, it's time that we start thinking crush can we go ahead and\nstart thinking crush can we go ahead and\nstart thinking crush can we go ahead and integrate some kind of external tools.\nintegrate some kind of external tools.\nintegrate some kind of external tools. Okay. So, for this let me go ahead and\nOkay. So, for this let me go ahead and\nOkay. So, for this let me go ahead and talk about a use case. Let's say I have\ntalk about a use case. Let's say I have\ntalk about a use case. Let's say I have a chatbot. Okay. Now this chatbot I have\na chatbot. Okay. Now this chatbot I have\na chatbot. Okay. Now this chatbot I have a question I can basically go ahead and\na question I can basically go ahead and\na question I can basically go ahead and ask a question for this chatbot saying\nask a question for this chatbot saying\nask a question for this chatbot saying that hey let's say this this chatbot I\nthat hey let's say this this chatbot I\nthat hey let's say this this chatbot I have and this chatbot you know what does\nhave and this chatbot you know what does\nhave and this chatbot you know what does it have it basically has a llm\nit have it basically has a llm\nit have it basically has a llm with some kind of prompt\nwith some kind of prompt\nwith some kind of prompt and it is taking an input from the start\nand it is taking an input from the start\nand it is taking an input from the start and it is basically ending it right so\nand it is basically ending it right so\nand it is basically ending it right so here start end now if I ask a question\nhere start end now if I ask a question\nhere start end now if I ask a question provide\nme the\nme the recent AI news. Do you think the chatbot\nrecent AI news. Do you think the chatbot\nrecent AI news. Do you think the chatbot with the help of this LLM will be able\nwith the help of this LLM will be able\nwith the help of this LLM will be able to provide the output? The answer is\nto provide the output? The answer is\nto provide the output? The answer is simple. No, it is not able to provide\nsimple. No, it is not able to provide\nsimple. No, it is not able to provide it. Why? Because LLM will not have any\nit. Why? Because LLM will not have any\nit. Why? Because LLM will not have any information related to live, right? Any\ninformation related to live, right? Any\ninformation related to live, right? Any live information it will not have. It\nlive information it will not have. It\nlive information it will not have. It may have not trained with the recent\nmay have not trained with the recent\nmay have not trained with the recent data right. So here the dependency on\ndata right. So here the dependency on\ndata right. So here the dependency on external tool comes right external tools\nexternal tool comes right external tools\nexternal tool comes right external tools comes right. So what we can basically do\ncomes right. So what we can basically do\ncomes right. So what we can basically do is that for this chatbot as soon as we\nis that for this chatbot as soon as we\nis that for this chatbot as soon as we give an input this chatbot should\ngive an input this chatbot should\ngive an input this chatbot should understand hey we are not able to answer\nunderstand hey we are not able to answer\nunderstand hey we are not able to answer it. So I definitely have to make a tool\nit. So I definitely have to make a tool\nit. So I definitely have to make a tool call.\ncall.\ncall. I definitely have to make a tool call.\nI definitely have to make a tool call.\nI definitely have to make a tool call. And when I'm making this specific tool\nAnd when I'm making this specific tool\nAnd when I'm making this specific tool call this tool call let's say this can\ncall this tool call let's say this can\ncall this tool call let's say this can be any third party API it can be uh\nbe any third party API it can be uh\nbe any third party API it can be uh Google search engine it can be let's say\nGoogle search engine it can be let's say\nGoogle search engine it can be let's say one of the search engine that we going\none of the search engine that we going\none of the search engine that we going to use is tavi tavi is nothing but it is\nto use is tavi tavi is nothing but it is\nto use is tavi tavi is nothing but it is a web search it provides a web search\na web search it provides a web search\na web search it provides a web search API okay and with respect to this tavi\nAPI okay and with respect to this tavi\nAPI okay and with respect to this tavi we will be able to get some kind of\nwe will be able to get some kind of\nwe will be able to get some kind of response over here okay so as soon as we\nresponse over here okay so as soon as we\nresponse over here okay so as soon as we make a tool call or in order to define\nmake a tool call or in order to define\nmake a tool call or in order to define it like this I will I will just make\nit like this I will I will just make\nit like this I will I will just make this graph a little bit longer now.\nthis graph a little bit longer now.\nthis graph a little bit longer now. Okay. So what what happens as soon as I\nOkay. So what what happens as soon as I\nOkay. So what what happens as soon as I get an input the next thing is that the\nget an input the next thing is that the\nget an input the next thing is that the chatbot is understanding it is a tool\nchatbot is understanding it is a tool\nchatbot is understanding it is a tool call. So it goes and makes a tool call\ncall. So it goes and makes a tool call\ncall. So it goes and makes a tool call and here we will define another node\nand here we will define another node\nand here we will define another node which will be called as tool node. Okay.\nwhich will be called as tool node. Okay.\nwhich will be called as tool node. Okay. And then based on this tool call I\nAnd then based on this tool call I\nAnd then based on this tool call I should be able to get the response in\nshould be able to get the response in\nshould be able to get the response in the end.\nthe end.\nthe end. Okay. So instead of chatbot\nOkay. So instead of chatbot\nOkay. So instead of chatbot not able to give you the output let's\nnot able to give you the output let's\nnot able to give you the output let's say if I give any input provide me the\nsay if I give any input provide me the\nsay if I give any input provide me the recent AI news this request will go to\nrecent AI news this request will go to\nrecent AI news this request will go to the chatbot chatbot will understand hey\nthe chatbot chatbot will understand hey\nthe chatbot chatbot will understand hey we do not we do not have that\nwe do not we do not have that\nwe do not we do not have that information so definitely I have to make\ninformation so definitely I have to make\ninformation so definitely I have to make a tool call so here what it will do it\na tool call so here what it will do it\na tool call so here what it will do it will make a tool call and then from here\nwill make a tool call and then from here\nwill make a tool call and then from here it'll go to end\nit'll go to end\nit'll go to end okay it'll go to end right and here in\nokay it'll go to end right and here in\nokay it'll go to end right and here in this tool node I may have multiple tools\nthis tool node I may have multiple tools\nthis tool node I may have multiple tools I may have tools like tabuli. I may also\nI may have tools like tabuli. I may also\nI may have tools like tabuli. I may also go ahead and define some custom tools.\ngo ahead and define some custom tools.\ngo ahead and define some custom tools. Let's say add,\nLet's say add,\nLet's say add, subtract\nsubtract\nsubtract or some custom implementation also you\nor some custom implementation also you\nor some custom implementation also you can go ahead and write. Right now the\ncan go ahead and write. Right now the\ncan go ahead and write. Right now the question arises how does this chatbot\nquestion arises how does this chatbot\nquestion arises how does this chatbot knows about the tool node? See there is\nknows about the tool node? See there is\nknows about the tool node? See there is something called as LLM. Okay, inside\nsomething called as LLM. Okay, inside\nsomething called as LLM. Okay, inside this chatbot we use LLM, right? LLM is\nthis chatbot we use LLM, right? LLM is\nthis chatbot we use LLM, right? LLM is actually the brain behind taking this\nactually the brain behind taking this\nactually the brain behind taking this decision. Why this LLM can be binded\ndecision. Why this LLM can be binded\ndecision. Why this LLM can be binded with this tools.\nWhen LLM is binding with this tools,\nWhen LLM is binding with this tools, what does this basically mean here? It\nwhat does this basically mean here? It\nwhat does this basically mean here? It means that let's say I go ahead and\nmeans that let's say I go ahead and\nmeans that let's say I go ahead and create one custom function. This custom\ncreate one custom function. This custom\ncreate one custom function. This custom function is called as addition. Let's\nfunction is called as addition. Let's\nfunction is called as addition. Let's say this is my addition. This can be\nsay this is my addition. This can be\nsay this is my addition. This can be added as a tool to the LLM. It can be\nadded as a tool to the LLM. It can be\nadded as a tool to the LLM. It can be binded with LLM itself. Then the LLM\nbinded with LLM itself. Then the LLM\nbinded with LLM itself. Then the LLM here whenever you define any custom tool\nhere whenever you define any custom tool\nhere whenever you define any custom tool you also need to provide the dock\nyou also need to provide the dock\nyou also need to provide the dock string.\nstring.\nstring. You need to provide the dock string. Now\nYou need to provide the dock string. Now\nYou need to provide the dock string. Now with the help of this dock string the\nwith the help of this dock string the\nwith the help of this dock string the LLM will know what are the inputs\nLLM will know what are the inputs\nLLM will know what are the inputs and what are the arguments that is\nand what are the arguments that is\nand what are the arguments that is required over here.\nrequired over here.\nrequired over here. So if this inputs and arguments matches\nSo if this inputs and arguments matches\nSo if this inputs and arguments matches with the input that we are giving in\nwith the input that we are giving in\nwith the input that we are giving in this chatbot\nthis chatbot\nthis chatbot then automatically this is going to make\nthen automatically this is going to make\nthen automatically this is going to make that particular tool call\nthat particular tool call\nthat particular tool call right so this same thing I will try to\nright so this same thing I will try to\nright so this same thing I will try to show you it in the practical way we will\nshow you it in the practical way we will\nshow you it in the practical way we will go ahead and create some some tools\ngo ahead and create some some tools\ngo ahead and create some some tools we'll also go ahead and create some of\nwe'll also go ahead and create some of\nwe'll also go ahead and create some of the custom tools and once we do that\nthe custom tools and once we do that\nthe custom tools and once we do that what we are basically going to do is\nwhat we are basically going to do is\nwhat we are basically going to do is that we also going to go ahead and\nthat we also going to go ahead and\nthat we also going to go ahead and create tool node\ncreate tool node\ncreate tool node and There is one more additional\nand There is one more additional\nand There is one more additional condition which is called as tool\ncondition which is called as tool\ncondition which is called as tool condition. So we will discuss about all\ncondition. So we will discuss about all\ncondition. So we will discuss about all these things with respect to this\nthese things with respect to this\nthese things with respect to this particular implementation. But our main\nparticular implementation. But our main\nparticular implementation. But our main point over here is that the chatbots can\npoint over here is that the chatbots can\npoint over here is that the chatbots can also be integrated with a separate tool\nalso be integrated with a separate tool\nalso be integrated with a separate tool node. And here it can also make a tool\nnode. And here it can also make a tool\nnode. And here it can also make a tool call based on a specific input that we\ncall based on a specific input that we\ncall based on a specific input that we get. Okay. How that can be implemented?\nget. Okay. How that can be implemented?\nget. Okay. How that can be implemented? by binding tools with the LLM and also\nby binding tools with the LLM and also\nby binding tools with the LLM and also defining your custom functions if it is\ndefining your custom functions if it is\ndefining your custom functions if it is required and this LLM will be able to\nrequired and this LLM will be able to\nrequired and this LLM will be able to understand whether it has any tool or\nunderstand whether it has any tool or\nunderstand whether it has any tool or not through this dock strings. Okay. So\nnot through this dock strings. Okay. So\nnot through this dock strings. Okay. So now let's go ahead and implement those\nnow let's go ahead and implement those\nnow let's go ahead and implement those functionality.\nfunctionality.\nfunctionality. So guys, now let's go ahead and start\nSo guys, now let's go ahead and start\nSo guys, now let's go ahead and start building a chatbot with tools with the\nbuilding a chatbot with tools with the\nbuilding a chatbot with tools with the help of langraph. Now first of all, I'll\nhelp of langraph. Now first of all, I'll\nhelp of langraph. Now first of all, I'll just show you like what we are trying to\njust show you like what we are trying to\njust show you like what we are trying to build over here. Okay. So here is one\nbuild over here. Okay. So here is one\nbuild over here. Okay. So here is one graph uh you know uh which we will try\ngraph uh you know uh which we will try\ngraph uh you know uh which we will try to create. Now just observe this graph.\nto create. Now just observe this graph.\nto create. Now just observe this graph. Okay. This graph is quite amazing\nOkay. This graph is quite amazing\nOkay. This graph is quite amazing because here uh we have a separate set\nbecause here uh we have a separate set\nbecause here uh we have a separate set of tools. Okay. Here we have a tool\nof tools. Okay. Here we have a tool\nof tools. Okay. Here we have a tool calling LLM. Okay. So from here uh we\ncalling LLM. Okay. So from here uh we\ncalling LLM. Okay. So from here uh we are definitely going to give our input.\nare definitely going to give our input.\nare definitely going to give our input. Now from this input as you know these\nNow from this input as you know these\nNow from this input as you know these are my edges.\nare my edges.\nare my edges. This tool calling LLM is my first node\nThis tool calling LLM is my first node\nThis tool calling LLM is my first node and this node has LLM.\nand this node has LLM.\nand this node has LLM. LLM\nLLM\nLLM with binding tools.\nwith binding tools.\nwith binding tools. Okay, when I say binding tools, what\nOkay, when I say binding tools, what\nOkay, when I say binding tools, what does this basically mean? So this means\ndoes this basically mean? So this means\ndoes this basically mean? So this means that I have LLMs and tools integrated\nthat I have LLMs and tools integrated\nthat I have LLMs and tools integrated with themselves. We will use couple of\nwith themselves. We will use couple of\nwith themselves. We will use couple of tools. One of the most famous tool that\ntools. One of the most famous tool that\ntools. One of the most famous tool that we will try to use let's say we will use\nwe will try to use let's say we will use\nwe will try to use let's say we will use Tavly API.\nTavly API.\nTavly API. or tably search. This is just like an\nor tably search. This is just like an\nor tably search. This is just like an internet search. Along with this, we'll\ninternet search. Along with this, we'll\ninternet search. Along with this, we'll also create some of our custom\nalso create some of our custom\nalso create some of our custom functions.\nfunctions.\nfunctions. Okay, we will uh create some of the\nOkay, we will uh create some of the\nOkay, we will uh create some of the custom functions or custom tools. Okay,\ncustom functions or custom tools. Okay,\ncustom functions or custom tools. Okay, tools. And remember here when I can also\ntools. And remember here when I can also\ntools. And remember here when I can also combine multiple tools in one tool node.\ncombine multiple tools in one tool node.\ncombine multiple tools in one tool node. Okay, so here what we doing is that\nOkay, so here what we doing is that\nOkay, so here what we doing is that we're going to combine this in one tool\nwe're going to combine this in one tool\nwe're going to combine this in one tool node. Okay. So this is nothing but this\nnode. Okay. So this is nothing but this\nnode. Okay. So this is nothing but this is a tool node and here you can observe\nis a tool node and here you can observe\nis a tool node and here you can observe one more very amazing thing right. So\none more very amazing thing right. So\none more very amazing thing right. So from this particular tool from this\nfrom this particular tool from this\nfrom this particular tool from this particular node here we have two paths\nparticular node here we have two paths\nparticular node here we have two paths either we can go there here or either we\neither we can go there here or either we\neither we can go there here or either we can go over here. So let's say if my\ncan go over here. So let's say if my\ncan go over here. So let's say if my question is hey what is the recent AI\nquestion is hey what is the recent AI\nquestion is hey what is the recent AI news? So the input will go over here.\nnews? So the input will go over here.\nnews? So the input will go over here. Then this tool calling LLM will decide\nThen this tool calling LLM will decide\nThen this tool calling LLM will decide whether it can give the answer or\nwhether it can give the answer or\nwhether it can give the answer or whether it is dependent on some tools.\nwhether it is dependent on some tools.\nwhether it is dependent on some tools. Since we have binded this tools and\nSince we have binded this tools and\nSince we have binded this tools and remember how LLM will be able to\nremember how LLM will be able to\nremember how LLM will be able to understand from the dock string, right?\nunderstand from the dock string, right?\nunderstand from the dock string, right? So in every tool there is some kind of\nSo in every tool there is some kind of\nSo in every tool there is some kind of dock string. Dock string is nothing but\ndock string. Dock string is nothing but\ndock string. Dock string is nothing but some brief information about what that\nsome brief information about what that\nsome brief information about what that tool actually does. Okay, I will also\ntool actually does. Okay, I will also\ntool actually does. Okay, I will also define one custom and show it to you.\ndefine one custom and show it to you.\ndefine one custom and show it to you. Then this tool calling LLM you know\nThen this tool calling LLM you know\nThen this tool calling LLM you know since it has those tool information it\nsince it has those tool information it\nsince it has those tool information it will take a decision whether it has to\nwill take a decision whether it has to\nwill take a decision whether it has to make a tool call or whether it can just\nmake a tool call or whether it can just\nmake a tool call or whether it can just answer it and go to end. Let's say if it\nanswer it and go to end. Let's say if it\nanswer it and go to end. Let's say if it makes a tool call the tool will then\nmakes a tool call the tool will then\nmakes a tool call the tool will then provide some kind of output message and\nprovide some kind of output message and\nprovide some kind of output message and it will end. If it is not a tool call it\nit will end. If it is not a tool call it\nit will end. If it is not a tool call it is just going to go and give you the\nis just going to go and give you the\nis just going to go and give you the output and go to the end state. Okay.\noutput and go to the end state. Okay.\noutput and go to the end state. Okay. So this is uh fundamentally a simple\nSo this is uh fundamentally a simple\nSo this is uh fundamentally a simple problem things that we are going to\nproblem things that we are going to\nproblem things that we are going to solve right now. Okay. And we'll solve\nsolve right now. Okay. And we'll solve\nsolve right now. Okay. And we'll solve it step by step. Okay. how how do we go\nit step by step. Okay. how how do we go\nit step by step. Okay. how how do we go ahead and solve it? Uh that I will\nahead and solve it? Uh that I will\nahead and solve it? Uh that I will discuss as we go ahead. Okay. So now let\ndiscuss as we go ahead. Okay. So now let\ndiscuss as we go ahead. Okay. So now let me go back to my code. So first of all\nme go back to my code. So first of all\nme go back to my code. So first of all in my requirement txt I will go ahead\nin my requirement txt I will go ahead\nin my requirement txt I will go ahead and import one library which is called\nand import one library which is called\nand import one library which is called as langchain_tavly.\nas langchain_tavly.\nas langchain_tavly. Okay. Now langchen tavly is nothing but\nOkay. Now langchen tavly is nothing but\nOkay. Now langchen tavly is nothing but uh if you see in my envi\nuh if you see in my envi\nuh if you see in my envi api we need a tavly api. Okay. And in my\napi we need a tavly api. Okay. And in my\napi we need a tavly api. Okay. And in my requirement.txt we need to first of all\nrequirement.txt we need to first of all\nrequirement.txt we need to first of all install this. So quickly let's go ahead\ninstall this. So quickly let's go ahead\ninstall this. So quickly let's go ahead and open my terminal and here I will go\nand open my terminal and here I will go\nand open my terminal and here I will go ahead and write uv add minus r\nahead and write uv add minus r\nahead and write uv add minus r requirement txt. Okay so once we do the\nrequirement txt. Okay so once we do the\nrequirement txt. Okay so once we do the installation the installation will be\ninstallation the installation will be\ninstallation the installation will be completed and uh we are good. We have\ncompleted and uh we are good. We have\ncompleted and uh we are good. We have this lang tabi. Uh the next step will be\nthis lang tabi. Uh the next step will be\nthis lang tabi. Uh the next step will be that I will just go ahead and open this\nthat I will just go ahead and open this\nthat I will just go ahead and open this website called as tabi. Okay. So here\nwebsite called as tabi. Okay. So here\nwebsite called as tabi. Okay. So here you can just go ahead and search for\nyou can just go ahead and search for\nyou can just go ahead and search for tabi.com.\ntabi.com.\ntabi.com.

It's just like\ntailored for LLM and RAG. It's just like\ntailored for LLM and RAG. It's just like an internet search. Okay. So, I will\nan internet search. Okay. So, I will\nan internet search. Okay. So, I will just go ahead and log in.\njust go ahead and log in.\njust go ahead and log in. Once I log in here, you can see that\nOnce I log in here, you can see that\nOnce I log in here, you can see that it'll give you one key. I will copy this\nit'll give you one key. I will copy this\nit'll give you one key. I will copy this key and it is free for free. Uh you can\nkey and it is free for free. Uh you can\nkey and it is free for free. Uh you can probably hit many number of requests\nprobably hit many number of requests\nprobably hit many number of requests with the help of this. So, I think you\nwith the help of this. So, I think you\nwith the help of this. So, I think you don't have to be dependent on my API\ndon't have to be dependent on my API\ndon't have to be dependent on my API key. Right. So, I will go ahead and\nkey. Right. So, I will go ahead and\nkey. Right. So, I will go ahead and write tab API key and I'll paste it over\nwrite tab API key and I'll paste it over\nwrite tab API key and I'll paste it over here. Right now the next thing is that\nhere. Right now the next thing is that\nhere. Right now the next thing is that uh since I'm working over here with with\nuh since I'm working over here with with\nuh since I'm working over here with with the help of this you know I will just go\nthe help of this you know I will just go\nthe help of this you know I will just go ahead and restart my kernel. Okay you\nahead and restart my kernel. Okay you\nahead and restart my kernel. Okay you have to restart your kernel otherwise\nhave to restart your kernel otherwise\nhave to restart your kernel otherwise things will not work you know the reason\nthings will not work you know the reason\nthings will not work you know the reason is very simple because we need to import\nis very simple because we need to import\nis very simple because we need to import this again. So I will first of all go\nthis again. So I will first of all go\nthis again. So I will first of all go ahead and execute this. This will\nahead and execute this. This will\nahead and execute this. This will basically be my lm. Okay this or this\nbasically be my lm. Okay this or this\nbasically be my lm. Okay this or this can be your lm no worries. Okay now I'll\ncan be your lm no worries. Okay now I'll\ncan be your lm no worries. Okay now I'll go back over here.\ngo back over here.\ngo back over here. Now let me go ahead and import some of\nNow let me go ahead and import some of\nNow let me go ahead and import some of the libraries. Right. So for tabi first\nthe libraries. Right. So for tabi first\nthe libraries. Right. So for tabi first of all I will go ahead and import this\nof all I will go ahead and import this\nof all I will go ahead and import this tool. So I'll write from langchain\ntool. So I'll write from langchain\ntool. So I'll write from langchain tavly. Okay. Uh I'm going to go ahead\ntavly. Okay. Uh I'm going to go ahead\ntavly. Okay. Uh I'm going to go ahead and import tavly search.\nand import tavly search.\nand import tavly search. Okay. I will go ahead and create this\nOkay. I will go ahead and create this\nOkay. I will go ahead and create this tool wherein I initialize the tavly\ntool wherein I initialize the tavly\ntool wherein I initialize the tavly search and here my max results is equal\nsearch and here my max results is equal\nsearch and here my max results is equal to two. Okay. And then I will define my\nto two. Okay. And then I will define my\nto two. Okay. And then I will define my tools. Let's say this will be my list of\ntools. Let's say this will be my list of\ntools. Let's say this will be my list of tools. Okay. I can still define many\ntools. Okay. I can still define many\ntools. Okay. I can still define many number of tools I like. Okay. But I'll\nnumber of tools I like. Okay. But I'll\nnumber of tools I like. Okay. But I'll use this tool. Let's say I will go ahead\nuse this tool. Let's say I will go ahead\nuse this tool. Let's say I will go ahead and just invoke with one message. Let's\nand just invoke with one message. Let's\nand just invoke with one message. Let's say I will write what is no or what is\nsay I will write what is no or what is\nsay I will write what is no or what is lang graph. Okay. So this will basically\nlang graph. Okay. So this will basically\nlang graph. Okay. So this will basically be my question. Now once I execute this\nbe my question. Now once I execute this\nbe my question. Now once I execute this here you should be able to see some kind\nhere you should be able to see some kind\nhere you should be able to see some kind of response. So here you can see what is\nof response. So here you can see what is\nof response. So here you can see what is lang graph results. You are able to see\nlang graph results. You are able to see\nlang graph results. You are able to see all these values title from different\nall these values title from different\nall these values title from different different source and URL you are able to\ndifferent source and URL you are able to\ndifferent source and URL you are able to see this right langraph is a Python\nsee this right langraph is a Python\nsee this right langraph is a Python library and all this information is\nlibrary and all this information is\nlibrary and all this information is specifically coming up. So once uh we\nspecifically coming up. So once uh we\nspecifically coming up. So once uh we have created this sav tavly search tool\nhave created this sav tavly search tool\nhave created this sav tavly search tool now our next step will be that uh we\nnow our next step will be that uh we\nnow our next step will be that uh we will just go ahead and try to create uh\nwill just go ahead and try to create uh\nwill just go ahead and try to create uh our custom method okay custom function\nour custom method okay custom function\nour custom method okay custom function so that gives you an idea like how you\nso that gives you an idea like how you\nso that gives you an idea like how you can also integrate a custom function and\ncan also integrate a custom function and\ncan also integrate a custom function and how lm is able to understand because I\nhow lm is able to understand because I\nhow lm is able to understand because I spoke about something called as dock\nspoke about something called as dock\nspoke about something called as dock string right so how do we write this\nstring right so how do we write this\nstring right so how do we write this dock string everything we'll discuss\ndock string everything we'll discuss\ndock string everything we'll discuss right so let's let's take a basic\nright so let's let's take a basic\nright so let's let's take a basic function so here uh I will define one\nfunction so here uh I will define one\nfunction so here uh I will define one custom function\ncustom function\ncustom function And this custom function here we're\nAnd this custom function here we're\nAnd this custom function here we're going to just go ahead and write\ngoing to just go ahead and write\ngoing to just go ahead and write definition multiply and let's say here I\ndefinition multiply and let's say here I\ndefinition multiply and let's say here I will go ahead and write a int\nwill go ahead and write a int\nwill go ahead and write a int b col int and let's say this is going to\nb col int and let's say this is going to\nb col int and let's say this is going to return type of int right so u now the\nreturn type of int right so u now the\nreturn type of int right so u now the question rises how do we go ahead and\nquestion rises how do we go ahead and\nquestion rises how do we go ahead and write our document string so this\nwrite our document string so this\nwrite our document string so this basically gives you a document string\nbasically gives you a document string\nbasically gives you a document string example okay here in the summary let's\nexample okay here in the summary let's\nexample okay here in the summary let's say I will go ahead and write multiply\nsay I will go ahead and write multiply\nsay I will go ahead and write multiply a and b okay and And then here uh let's\na and b okay and And then here uh let's\na and b okay and And then here uh let's say a will be my first int b will be my\nsay a will be my first int b will be my\nsay a will be my first int b will be my second int\nsecond int\nsecond int and it returns an\noutput int. Right? So it is something\noutput int. Right? So it is something like this. I've just written some\nlike this. I've just written some\nlike this. I've just written some information. Now this is what is called\ninformation. Now this is what is called\ninformation. Now this is what is called as dock string. Okay. Now this dock\nas dock string. Okay. Now this dock\nas dock string. Okay. Now this dock string will be very important because\nstring will be very important because\nstring will be very important because once we bind any functions right with\nonce we bind any functions right with\nonce we bind any functions right with our LLM or this functions can also be\nour LLM or this functions can also be\nour LLM or this functions can also be converted as a tools and bind it right\nconverted as a tools and bind it right\nconverted as a tools and bind it right and then LLM will be able to understand\nand then LLM will be able to understand\nand then LLM will be able to understand what this tool will be able to do it now\nwhat this tool will be able to do it now\nwhat this tool will be able to do it now what I will do I will go ahead and\nwhat I will do I will go ahead and\nwhat I will do I will go ahead and create my variable tools here I'm going\ncreate my variable tools here I'm going\ncreate my variable tools here I'm going to use first tool multiply and let me\nto use first tool multiply and let me\nto use first tool multiply and let me just go ahead and execute it right now\njust go ahead and execute it right now\njust go ahead and execute it right now as I told you that I need to bind this\nas I told you that I need to bind this\nas I told you that I need to bind this entire tools this list of tools with my\nentire tools this list of tools with my\nentire tools this list of tools with my LLM So I will go ahead and write llm dot\nLLM So I will go ahead and write llm dot\nLLM So I will go ahead and write llm dot bind tools and here we're going to\nbind tools and here we're going to\nbind tools and here we're going to basically go ahead and write tools and\nbasically go ahead and write tools and\nbasically go ahead and write tools and this will be nothing but llm with tools.\nthis will be nothing but llm with tools.\nthis will be nothing but llm with tools. So once I go ahead and write so here now\nSo once I go ahead and write so here now\nSo once I go ahead and write so here now if you go ahead and see this is nothing\nif you go ahead and see this is nothing\nif you go ahead and see this is nothing but llm with tool right. So this is\nbut llm with tool right. So this is\nbut llm with tool right. So this is nothing but it is a run runnable binding\nnothing but it is a run runnable binding\nnothing but it is a run runnable binding chad grock. It has all the information\nchad grock. It has all the information\nchad grock. It has all the information over here and uh what all functions it\nover here and uh what all functions it\nover here and uh what all functions it is basically connected to like it is\nis basically connected to like it is\nis basically connected to like it is connected to tavly search it is\nconnected to tavly search it is\nconnected to tavly search it is connected to multiply you can find out\nconnected to multiply you can find out\nconnected to multiply you can find out all those specific information over here\nall those specific information over here\nall those specific information over here itself right and this is how uh things\nitself right and this is how uh things\nitself right and this is how uh things work in this. Now once we have defined\nwork in this. Now once we have defined\nwork in this. Now once we have defined this llm with tool this tool we are\nthis llm with tool this tool we are\nthis llm with tool this tool we are going to use inside our chatbot node.\ngoing to use inside our chatbot node.\ngoing to use inside our chatbot node. Okay. So now let's go ahead and create\nOkay. So now let's go ahead and create\nOkay. So now let's go ahead and create the entire state graph right remember\nthe entire state graph right remember\nthe entire state graph right remember the structure of the state graph how it\nthe structure of the state graph how it\nthe structure of the state graph how it will be I have start I have tool calling\nwill be I have start I have tool calling\nwill be I have start I have tool calling lm this is connected to tools and this\nlm this is connected to tools and this\nlm this is connected to tools and this is end okay now our question is that how\nis end okay now our question is that how\nis end okay now our question is that how do we basically create this tool nodes\ndo we basically create this tool nodes\ndo we basically create this tool nodes also and for this also we have some\nalso and for this also we have some\nalso and for this also we have some predefined uh packages uh available in\npredefined uh packages uh available in\npredefined uh packages uh available in langraph okay so I will quickly go ahead\nlangraph okay so I will quickly go ahead\nlangraph okay so I will quickly go ahead and write from langraph\nand write from langraph\nand write from langraph from langraph graph dot graph as usual.\nfrom langraph graph dot graph as usual.\nfrom langraph graph dot graph as usual. I'm going to go ahead and import state\nI'm going to go ahead and import state\nI'm going to go ahead and import state graph. See again I'm importing all these\ngraph. See again I'm importing all these\ngraph. See again I'm importing all these things so that you get to know like I\nthings so that you get to know like I\nthings so that you get to know like I know in the top already we have imported\nknow in the top already we have imported\nknow in the top already we have imported it but you should know what all things\nit but you should know what all things\nit but you should know what all things are there. So from langraph dotp\nare there. So from langraph dotp\nare there. So from langraph dotp pre-built I'm going to go ahead and\npre-built I'm going to go ahead and\npre-built I'm going to go ahead and import tool node right see we have\nimport tool node right see we have\nimport tool node right see we have anyhow binded this llm with all the\nanyhow binded this llm with all the\nanyhow binded this llm with all the specific tools right so binding will\nspecific tools right so binding will\nspecific tools right so binding will play a very important role see there are\nplay a very important role see there are\nplay a very important role see there are two important things one is binding\ntwo important things one is binding\ntwo important things one is binding when we are binding llm with tools\nwhen we are binding llm with tools\nwhen we are binding llm with tools this actually helps the llm to\nthis actually helps the llm to\nthis actually helps the llm to understand which all tools it has which\nunderstand which all tools it has which\nunderstand which all tools it has which all tools it has right so whenever an\nall tools it has right so whenever an\nall tools it has right so whenever an input comes it's just like just imagine\ninput comes it's just like just imagine\ninput comes it's just like just imagine LLM has some kind of weapons to solve\nLLM has some kind of weapons to solve\nLLM has some kind of weapons to solve your input right if I ask hey provide me\nyour input right if I ask hey provide me\nyour input right if I ask hey provide me the recent AI news obviously LLM will\nthe recent AI news obviously LLM will\nthe recent AI news obviously LLM will not be able to do it it will do an\nnot be able to do it it will do an\nnot be able to do it it will do an internet search and it will try to\ninternet search and it will try to\ninternet search and it will try to provide you the response right when we\nprovide you the response right when we\nprovide you the response right when we do this binding it is just trying to\ndo this binding it is just trying to\ndo this binding it is just trying to give you an information that LLM has all\ngive you an information that LLM has all\ngive you an information that LLM has all the specific tools but further when an\nthe specific tools but further when an\nthe specific tools but further when an LLM makes a tool call\nLLM makes a tool call\nLLM makes a tool call it has to make a call to this tool that\nit has to make a call to this tool that\nit has to make a call to this tool that is what we really need to understand how\nis what we really need to understand how\nis what we really need to understand how that tool call will be happening okay so\nthat tool call will be happening okay so\nthat tool call will be happening okay so I'll go back over here\nI'll go back over here\nI'll go back over here we have imported something called as\nwe have imported something called as\nwe have imported something called as tool node now all the tools that we have\ntool node now all the tools that we have\ntool node now all the tools that we have created these all tools it has some kind\ncreated these all tools it has some kind\ncreated these all tools it has some kind of functionalities right these needs to\nof functionalities right these needs to\nof functionalities right these needs to get converted into a tool node Okay,\nget converted into a tool node Okay,\nget converted into a tool node Okay, because each tool node will be having\nbecause each tool node will be having\nbecause each tool node will be having some kind of implementation. Along with\nsome kind of implementation. Along with\nsome kind of implementation. Along with this, we will also go ahead and import\nthis, we will also go ahead and import\nthis, we will also go ahead and import one more library from\none more library from\none more library from langraph.prebbuilt.\nlangraph.prebbuilt.\nlangraph.prebbuilt. import\nimport\nimport tools condition. Okay. Now, first of\ntools condition. Okay. Now, first of\ntools condition. Okay. Now, first of all, we will go ahead and start with the\nall, we will go ahead and start with the\nall, we will go ahead and start with the node definition. Okay. Here we are going\nnode definition. Okay. Here we are going\nnode definition. Okay. Here we are going to create a uh definition. Okay. And\nto create a uh definition. Okay. And\nto create a uh definition. Okay. And before creating a node definition also\nbefore creating a node definition also\nbefore creating a node definition also first let's start creating the graph.\nfirst let's start creating the graph.\nfirst let's start creating the graph. Okay. So you know first of all we going\nOkay. So you know first of all we going\nOkay. So you know first of all we going to use a builder. This will be of type\nto use a builder. This will be of type\nto use a builder. This will be of type state graph.\nstate graph.\nstate graph. State graph. And inside the state graph\nState graph. And inside the state graph\nState graph. And inside the state graph we will be using something called as\nwe will be using something called as\nwe will be using something called as state. Okay. This will be our class\nstate. Okay. This will be our class\nstate. Okay. This will be our class specifically state class. Then in the\nspecifically state class. Then in the\nspecifically state class. Then in the next step is that we going to go ahead\nnext step is that we going to go ahead\nnext step is that we going to go ahead and create our builder. Add node. So two\nand create our builder. Add node. So two\nand create our builder. Add node. So two one node uh two nodes we definitely\none node uh two nodes we definitely\none node uh two nodes we definitely require if you see in this graph one is\nrequire if you see in this graph one is\nrequire if you see in this graph one is a tool calling llm and one is the tools\na tool calling llm and one is the tools\na tool calling llm and one is the tools right. So first we will go ahead and\nright. So first we will go ahead and\nright. So first we will go ahead and create this node. Inside this node we\ncreate this node. Inside this node we\ncreate this node. Inside this node we will give the name as tool calling llm.\nwill give the name as tool calling llm.\nwill give the name as tool calling llm. Okay,\nOkay,\nOkay, and then I have something called as tool\nand then I have something called as tool\nand then I have something called as tool or I have to define the functionality of\nor I have to define the functionality of\nor I have to define the functionality of this node. Right? So this in the later\nthis node. Right? So this in the later\nthis node. Right? So this in the later stages will define still I'm not defined\nstages will define still I'm not defined\nstages will define still I'm not defined because I will be defining it over here.\nbecause I will be defining it over here.\nbecause I will be defining it over here. The other edge that we really need to\nThe other edge that we really need to\nThe other edge that we really need to create or other node that we need to\ncreate or other node that we need to\ncreate or other node that we need to create is nothing but add node is\ncreate is nothing but add node is\ncreate is nothing but add node is nothing but tools and remember this\nnothing but tools and remember this\nnothing but tools and remember this tools will be nothing but it will be of\ntools will be nothing but it will be of\ntools will be nothing but it will be of node type of tool and here we are going\nnode type of tool and here we are going\nnode type of tool and here we are going to give all our tools itself. So this\nto give all our tools itself. So this\nto give all our tools itself. So this node is nothing but it is this specific\nnode is nothing but it is this specific\nnode is nothing but it is this specific nodes and inside this node if I want to\nnodes and inside this node if I want to\nnodes and inside this node if I want to go ahead and write a definition it will\ngo ahead and write a definition it will\ngo ahead and write a definition it will be of tool nodes. If you go ahead and\nbe of tool nodes. If you go ahead and\nbe of tool nodes. If you go ahead and see the definition of this tool nodes,\nsee the definition of this tool nodes,\nsee the definition of this tool nodes, it is how all the list of tools that we\nit is how all the list of tools that we\nit is how all the list of tools that we specify, it will be implemented as a\nspecify, it will be implemented as a\nspecify, it will be implemented as a tool node itself. Okay. So this is my\ntool node itself. Okay. So this is my\ntool node itself. Okay. So this is my node name and this is the definition.\nnode name and this is the definition.\nnode name and this is the definition. This is my node name and this is the\nThis is my node name and this is the\nThis is my node name and this is the definition. Now let's go ahead and\ndefinition. Now let's go ahead and\ndefinition. Now let's go ahead and create the definition. So for creating\ncreate the definition. So for creating\ncreate the definition. So for creating the definition, I'll go ahead and write\nthe definition, I'll go ahead and write\nthe definition, I'll go ahead and write tool_calling\nlm. And here we are going to define\nlm. And here we are going to define state colon state. And here we are going\nstate colon state. And here we are going\nstate colon state. And here we are going to go ahead and write return\nto go ahead and write return\nto go ahead and write return messages\nmessages\nmessages colon. Again what we are going to go\ncolon. Again what we are going to go\ncolon. Again what we are going to go ahead and write here we are not directly\nahead and write here we are not directly\nahead and write here we are not directly going to call lm but instead we are\ngoing to call lm but instead we are\ngoing to call lm but instead we are going to call lmit tool right. So here\ngoing to call lmit tool right. So here\ngoing to call lmit tool right. So here llm tool dot invoke and where do we get\nllm tool dot invoke and where do we get\nllm tool dot invoke and where do we get the input from? from state of\nthe input from? from state of\nthe input from? from state of messages. Right? So here we are going to\nmessages. Right? So here we are going to\nmessages. Right? So here we are going to go ahead and define state of messages.\ngo ahead and define state of messages.\ngo ahead and define state of messages. Perfect. So here you can see very clear.\nPerfect. So here you can see very clear.\nPerfect. So here you can see very clear. Now in the next step we are going to go\nNow in the next step we are going to go\nNow in the next step we are going to go ahead and add the edges. Now adding the\nahead and add the edges. Now adding the\nahead and add the edges. Now adding the edges is really important. If you\nedges is really important. If you\nedges is really important. If you understand this any kind of complex use\nunderstand this any kind of complex use\nunderstand this any kind of complex use cases you'll be able to understand it.\ncases you'll be able to understand it.\ncases you'll be able to understand it. Okay. So the first edge is from start to\nOkay. So the first edge is from start to\nOkay. So the first edge is from start to tool calling LLM. Okay. So first of all\ntool calling LLM. Okay. So first of all\ntool calling LLM. Okay. So first of all let's create that. In order to create it\nlet's create that. In order to create it\nlet's create that. In order to create it uh we will just go ahead and write\nuh we will just go ahead and write\nuh we will just go ahead and write something like this. See builder.addage\nsomething like this. See builder.addage\nsomething like this. See builder.addage start to tool calling llm. Now from tool\nstart to tool calling llm. Now from tool\nstart to tool calling llm. Now from tool calling llm there are two nodes that are\ncalling llm there are two nodes that are\ncalling llm there are two nodes that are going on right sorry two edges. One edge\ngoing on right sorry two edges. One edge\ngoing on right sorry two edges. One edge is going to the end and one edge is\nis going to the end and one edge is\nis going to the end and one edge is going to the tools. Right. Now this kind\ngoing to the tools. Right. Now this kind\ngoing to the tools. Right. Now this kind of edges are called as conditional\nof edges are called as conditional\nof edges are called as conditional edges. Okay. So in order to add a\nedges. Okay. So in order to add a\nedges. Okay. So in order to add a conditional edges it will be like\nconditional edges it will be like\nconditional edges it will be like builder dot add conditional edges. And\nbuilder dot add conditional edges. And\nbuilder dot add conditional edges. And inside this we are going to call our\ninside this we are going to call our\ninside this we are going to call our tool calling LLM. From two calling LLM\ntool calling LLM. From two calling LLM\ntool calling LLM. From two calling LLM this will happen right from this\nthis will happen right from this\nthis will happen right from this specific node it is going to happen. So\nspecific node it is going to happen. So\nspecific node it is going to happen. So tool calling LLM and in the next this is\ntool calling LLM and in the next this is\ntool calling LLM and in the next this is really important. Okay in the next we\nreally important. Okay in the next we\nreally important. Okay in the next we are going to import something called as\nare going to import something called as\nare going to import something called as tools condition. Now the question rises\ntools condition. Now the question rises\ntools condition. Now the question rises Kish what is this tool condition? Tool\nKish what is this tool condition? Tool\nKish what is this tool condition? Tool condition applies two different kind of\ncondition applies two different kind of\ncondition applies two different kind of conditions. One is let me go ahead and\nconditions. One is let me go ahead and\nconditions. One is let me go ahead and write it over here.\nwrite it over here.\nwrite it over here. If the latest message right in the input\nIf the latest message right in the input\nIf the latest message right in the input message when we giving from the\nmessage when we giving from the\nmessage when we giving from the assistant from the if the latest message\nassistant from the if the latest message\nassistant from the if the latest message from the assistant is a tool call then\nfrom the assistant is a tool call then\nfrom the assistant is a tool call then tool condition routes to tool node. So\ntool condition routes to tool node. So\ntool condition routes to tool node. So tool node is basically created over\ntool node is basically created over\ntool node is basically created over here. Right? If you create with this\nhere. Right? If you create with this\nhere. Right? If you create with this other name this will not happen then.\nother name this will not happen then.\nother name this will not happen then. Okay. So that is the reason we have\nOkay. So that is the reason we have\nOkay. So that is the reason we have created this tools node. Okay. If the\ncreated this tools node. Okay. If the\ncreated this tools node. Okay. If the assistant is saying it is not a tool\nassistant is saying it is not a tool\nassistant is saying it is not a tool call then it will go to the end. that\ncall then it will go to the end. that\ncall then it will go to the end. that basically means this will serve and\nbasically means this will serve and\nbasically means this will serve and it'll go to the end. So this tool\nit'll go to the end. So this tool\nit'll go to the end. So this tool condition basically applies two\ncondition basically applies two\ncondition basically applies two different condition. If the latest\ndifferent condition. If the latest\ndifferent condition. If the latest message from assistant is a tool call,\nmessage from assistant is a tool call,\nmessage from assistant is a tool call, tool condition routes to tool. If the\ntool condition routes to tool. If the\ntool condition routes to tool. If the latest u message from the assistant is\nlatest u message from the assistant is\nlatest u message from the assistant is not a tool call, tool condition routes\nnot a tool call, tool condition routes\nnot a tool call, tool condition routes to end. And that is where you are\nto end. And that is where you are\nto end. And that is where you are actually doing this with help of tool\nactually doing this with help of tool\nactually doing this with help of tool condition. Okay, very simple. Here if\ncondition. Okay, very simple. Here if\ncondition. Okay, very simple. Here if this tool calling LLM is making a tool\nthis tool calling LLM is making a tool\nthis tool calling LLM is making a tool call, it will go to the tool node\ncall, it will go to the tool node\ncall, it will go to the tool node otherwise it will go to the end node.\notherwise it will go to the end node.\notherwise it will go to the end node. That is what tool condition does. Okay.\nThat is what tool condition does. Okay.\nThat is what tool condition does. Okay. And uh that is a kind of see whenever\nAnd uh that is a kind of see whenever\nAnd uh that is a kind of see whenever there are two edges coming from a node\nthere are two edges coming from a node\nthere are two edges coming from a node it has to go inside this additional\nit has to go inside this additional\nit has to go inside this additional conditional edges. Add conditional\nconditional edges. Add conditional\nconditional edges. Add conditional edges. Okay. Now finally I will go ahead\nedges. Okay. Now finally I will go ahead\nedges. Okay. Now finally I will go ahead and add the final edge builder dot add\nand add the final edge builder dot add\nand add the final edge builder dot add edge. Then you know where this add edge\nedge. Then you know where this add edge\nedge. Then you know where this add edge should go right the final edge will be\nshould go right the final edge will be\nshould go right the final edge will be nothing but it'll be from tools\nnothing but it'll be from tools\nnothing but it'll be from tools to end\nto end\nto end right the other part\nright the other part\nright the other part sorry this is a keyword so other part is\nsorry this is a keyword so other part is\nsorry this is a keyword so other part is that by default if it is not a tool\nthat by default if it is not a tool\nthat by default if it is not a tool called it is anyhow going to go to the\ncalled it is anyhow going to go to the\ncalled it is anyhow going to go to the end okay so this is actually managing\nend okay so this is actually managing\nend okay so this is actually managing the other condition now finally we will\nthe other condition now finally we will\nthe other condition now finally we will go ahead and compile the graph compile\ngo ahead and compile the graph compile\ngo ahead and compile the graph compile compile the graph. After compiling it,\ncompile the graph. After compiling it,\ncompile the graph. After compiling it, uh let's go ahead and write it out.\nuh let's go ahead and write it out.\nuh let's go ahead and write it out. Graph is equal to builder dot compile,\nGraph is equal to builder dot compile,\nGraph is equal to builder dot compile, right? And then we going to go ahead and\nright? And then we going to go ahead and\nright? And then we going to go ahead and view the graph. Okay, so for give\nview the graph. Okay, so for give\nview the graph. Okay, so for give viewing the graph, it will be nothing\nviewing the graph, it will be nothing\nviewing the graph, it will be nothing but use that same function called as\nbut use that same function called as\nbut use that same function called as display.\ndisplay.\ndisplay. And here we go. Uh state is not defined.\nAnd here we go. Uh state is not defined.\nAnd here we go. Uh state is not defined. Okay, state is not defined. Let me go\nOkay, state is not defined. Let me go\nOkay, state is not defined. Let me go ahead and again I think I restarted the\nahead and again I think I restarted the\nahead and again I think I restarted the kernel, right? So that is the reason we\nkernel, right? So that is the reason we\nkernel, right? So that is the reason we got that issue. So I will just go ahead\ngot that issue. So I will just go ahead\ngot that issue. So I will just go ahead and execute this. Okay, this two thing\nand execute this. Okay, this two thing\nand execute this. Okay, this two thing I'll execute it. Perfect. Now this\nI'll execute it. Perfect. Now this\nI'll execute it. Perfect. Now this should definitely work. So here you can\nshould definitely work. So here you can\nshould definitely work. So here you can see that I'm getting one error node\nsee that I'm getting one error node\nsee that I'm getting one error node already present. The thing is that I did\nalready present. The thing is that I did\nalready present. The thing is that I did not define the node definition over\nnot define the node definition over\nnot define the node definition over here. Okay. So let's go ahead and define\nhere. Okay. So let's go ahead and define\nhere. Okay. So let's go ahead and define this and execute it. Okay. Uh image is\nthis and execute it. Okay. Uh image is\nthis and execute it. Okay. Uh image is not defined uh because I need to import\nnot defined uh because I need to import\nnot defined uh because I need to import the image library. It's okay. No\nthe image library. It's okay. No\nthe image library. It's okay. No worries. I will do that. Okay. Now here\nworries. I will do that. Okay. Now here\nworries. I will do that. Okay. Now here you can see I've got the same image\nyou can see I've got the same image\nyou can see I've got the same image start tool calling LLM tools and end.\nstart tool calling LLM tools and end.\nstart tool calling LLM tools and end. Okay, now it's time we see that how we\nOkay, now it's time we see that how we\nOkay, now it's time we see that how we can probably call this okay quickly. So\ncan probably call this okay quickly. So\ncan probably call this okay quickly.

And here you are able to see this. And finally,\nyou are able to see this. And finally,\nyou are able to see this. And finally, the tool message that you are getting\nthe tool message that you are getting\nthe tool message that you are getting recent AI news, follow-up questions, all\nrecent AI news, follow-up questions, all\nrecent AI news, follow-up questions, all this information that you're able to\nthis information that you're able to\nthis information that you're able to see. Okay? Now we need to see what\nsee. Okay? Now we need to see what\nsee. Okay? Now we need to see what information is able to see right. So now\ninformation is able to see right. So now\ninformation is able to see right. So now I will just quickly save this in some\nI will just quickly save this in some\nI will just quickly save this in some kind of response.\nkind of response.\nkind of response.

What\nis 2 * 3 or the multiply function. What\nis 2 * 3 or the multiply function. What is 2 * 3, right? And we will try to\nis 2 * 3, right? And we will try to\nis 2 * 3, right? And we will try to display the same response over here.\ndisplay the same response over here.\ndisplay the same response over here. This time it will make another tool\nThis time it will make another tool\nThis time it will make another tool call. Okay? And that tool call will be\ncall. Okay? And that tool call will be\ncall. Okay? And that tool call will be nothing but it will be a multiply tool\nnothing but it will be a multiply tool\nnothing but it will be a multiply tool call. See multiply tool call. Now how it\ncall. See multiply tool call. Now how it\ncall. See multiply tool call. Now how it is able to do it? Because LLM has that\nis able to do it? Because LLM has that\nis able to do it? Because LLM has that binding information already, right? And\nbinding information already, right? And\nbinding information already, right? And it is able to make this specific tool\nit is able to make this specific tool\nit is able to make this specific tool call in a much more easy way. But still\ncall in a much more easy way. But still\ncall in a much more easy way. But still there is one very important thing. See\nthere is one very important thing. See\nthere is one very important thing. See tool message is coming up something but\ntool message is coming up something but\ntool message is coming up something but the operation is not happening. Right?\nthe operation is not happening. Right?\nthe operation is not happening. Right? Why why it is not happening? See over\nWhy why it is not happening? See over\nWhy why it is not happening? See over here you can see that what is 2\nhere you can see that what is 2\nhere you can see that what is 2 multiplied by 3 or I'll just go ahead\nmultiplied by 3 or I'll just go ahead\nmultiplied by 3 or I'll just go ahead and ask what is 5 *\nand ask what is 5 *\nand ask what is 5 * 2. If I'm executing this okay so here\n2. If I'm executing this okay so here\n2. If I'm executing this okay so here you will be able to see that 5\nyou will be able to see that 5\nyou will be able to see that 5 multiplied by two it is not probably\nmultiplied by two it is not probably\nmultiplied by two it is not probably producing the right kind of output. So\nproducing the right kind of output. So\nproducing the right kind of output. So one interesting thing you could see guys\none interesting thing you could see guys\none interesting thing you could see guys over here when I'm multiplying here the\nover here when I'm multiplying here the\nover here when I'm multiplying here the output is null right then I got to see\noutput is null right then I got to see\noutput is null right then I got to see that there was some mistakes that we did\nthat there was some mistakes that we did\nthat there was some mistakes that we did we did not go ahead and write the\nwe did not go ahead and write the\nwe did not go ahead and write the definition so return a multiplied by b\ndefinition so return a multiplied by b\ndefinition so return a multiplied by b okay so now I'll execute this this will\nokay so now I'll execute this this will\nokay so now I'll execute this this will be basically be my tools tool lm binding\nbe basically be my tools tool lm binding\nbe basically be my tools tool lm binding tools so this will be my llm tool now uh\ntools so this will be my llm tool now uh\ntools so this will be my llm tool now uh let's see I think now it should get\nlet's see I think now it should get\nlet's see I think now it should get executed so five multiplied by two okay\nexecuted so five multiplied by two okay\nexecuted so five multiplied by two okay still I have to go ahead and recompile\nstill I have to go ahead and recompile\nstill I have to go ahead and recompile my graph. Okay, so I'll go ahead and\nmy graph. Okay, so I'll go ahead and\nmy graph. Okay, so I'll go ahead and recompile my graph. Now if I just go\nrecompile my graph. Now if I just go\nrecompile my graph. Now if I just go ahead and execute it. Let's see it'll\nahead and execute it. Let's see it'll\nahead and execute it. Let's see it'll come. So now you can see uh tool call\ncome. So now you can see uh tool call\ncome. So now you can see uh tool call has made 5,2 argument it is able to find\nhas made 5,2 argument it is able to find\nhas made 5,2 argument it is able to find out and tool message is nothing but name\nout and tool message is nothing but name\nout and tool message is nothing but name multiply and answer is 10. So this kind\nmultiply and answer is 10. So this kind\nmultiply and answer is 10. So this kind of issues smaller issues may come but\nof issues smaller issues may come but\nof issues smaller issues may come but you need to go ahead and fix it. Okay.\nyou need to go ahead and fix it. Okay.\nyou need to go ahead and fix it. Okay. But now one more important thing is that\nBut now one more important thing is that\nBut now one more important thing is that what if I just go ahead and write\nwhat if I just go ahead and write\nwhat if I just go ahead and write something like this. Okay, see this.\nsomething like this. Okay, see this.\nsomething like this. Okay, see this. Okay, what is 5 * 2 and then add 10.\nOkay, what is 5 * 2 and then add 10.\nOkay, what is 5 * 2 and then add 10. Okay, or let's say I'll go ahead and say\nOkay, or let's say I'll go ahead and say\nOkay, or let's say I'll go ahead and say then multiply 10. Okay, if I go ahead\nthen multiply 10. Okay, if I go ahead\nthen multiply 10. Okay, if I go ahead and execute this here, you'll be able to\nand execute this here, you'll be able to\nand execute this here, you'll be able to see some kind of messages. Let's see. So\nsee some kind of messages. Let's see. So\nsee some kind of messages. Let's see. So here you can see first what is 2\nhere you can see first what is 2\nhere you can see first what is 2 multiply by two and then multiply by 10.\nmultiply by two and then multiply by 10.\nmultiply by two and then multiply by 10. So multiply 52\nSo multiply 52\nSo multiply 52 10 2. Okay, it is able to capture the\n10 2. Okay, it is able to capture the\n10 2. Okay, it is able to capture the argument. It is able to find out this\nargument. It is able to find out this\nargument. It is able to find out this multiply and here also we are able to\nmultiply and here also we are able to\nmultiply and here also we are able to get it right. So what is 5 m* 2 and then\nget it right. So what is 5 m* 2 and then\nget it right. So what is 5 m* 2 and then multiply by 10? It is able to find it\nmultiply by 10? It is able to find it\nmultiply by 10? It is able to find it out. Okay. Now see I will again change\nout. Okay. Now see I will again change\nout. Okay. Now see I will again change this. This is also working. give me the\nthis. This is also working. give me the\nthis. This is also working. give me the the recent\nthe recent\nthe recent AI news\nAI news\nAI news and then multiply\nand then multiply\nand then multiply multiply\nmultiply\nmultiply 5 by 10.\n5 by 10.\n5 by 10. Now if I execute this with this kind of\nNow if I execute this with this kind of\nNow if I execute this with this kind of query now just think over it you know\nquery now just think over it you know\nquery now just think over it you know what is going to happen. So here one\nwhat is going to happen. So here one\nwhat is going to happen. So here one very important thing happened right?\nvery important thing happened right?\nvery important thing happened right? Give me the recent AI news. In this\nGive me the recent AI news. In this\nGive me the recent AI news. In this particular sentence, there are two two\nparticular sentence, there are two two\nparticular sentence, there are two two important sentence itself. One is the\nimportant sentence itself. One is the\nimportant sentence itself. One is the give me the recent AI news and then\ngive me the recent AI news and then\ngive me the recent AI news and then multiply 5 by 10. With respect to the\nmultiply 5 by 10. With respect to the\nmultiply 5 by 10. With respect to the give me the recent AI news and then\ngive me the recent AI news and then\ngive me the recent AI news and then multiply here you can see tavly search\nmultiply here you can see tavly search\nmultiply here you can see tavly search is done but after that it gave the\nis done but after that it gave the\nis done but after that it gave the output and it came out. But what about\noutput and it came out. But what about\noutput and it came out. But what about this particular query right now what has\nthis particular query right now what has\nthis particular query right now what has actually happened? See if this is my\nactually happened? See if this is my\nactually happened? See if this is my LLM.\nLLM.\nLLM. Okay, this is my LLM or this is my\nOkay, this is my LLM or this is my\nOkay, this is my LLM or this is my chatbot. Let's say\nchatbot. Let's say\nchatbot. Let's say here I asked question, what is the\nhere I asked question, what is the\nhere I asked question, what is the recent AI news?\nWhat is the recent AI news? And I asked\nWhat is the recent AI news? And I asked multiply 5 by 2. Let's say I asked this\nmultiply 5 by 2. Let's say I asked this\nmultiply 5 by 2. Let's say I asked this two question. So in a sentence there are\ntwo question. So in a sentence there are\ntwo question. So in a sentence there are two questions, right? LLM as soon as it\ntwo questions, right? LLM as soon as it\ntwo questions, right? LLM as soon as it got the input,\ngot the input,\ngot the input, it made a tool call. The tool call was\nit made a tool call. The tool call was\nit made a tool call. The tool call was in a tool node. Why it make a tool call?\nin a tool node. Why it make a tool call?\nin a tool node. Why it make a tool call? Because here you can see that it is\nBecause here you can see that it is\nBecause here you can see that it is asking for the recent AI news and it\nasking for the recent AI news and it\nasking for the recent AI news and it knows that in the tool call it has Tavly\nknows that in the tool call it has Tavly\nknows that in the tool call it has Tavly API.\nAPI.\nAPI. Okay, Tavly and then from here it went\nOkay, Tavly and then from here it went\nOkay, Tavly and then from here it went to the end\nto the end\nto the end node right this was start this was end.\nnode right this was start this was end.\nnode right this was start this was end. But what about this particular question\nBut what about this particular question\nBut what about this particular question multiplied 5 by two right and this is\nmultiplied 5 by two right and this is\nmultiplied 5 by two right and this is how was my entire graph don't you think\nhow was my entire graph don't you think\nhow was my entire graph don't you think if we made some kind of changes then\nif we made some kind of changes then\nif we made some kind of changes then this answer will also be able to come\nthis answer will also be able to come\nthis answer will also be able to come and what was the changes here\nand what was the changes here\nand what was the changes here instead of once the tool node gives you\ninstead of once the tool node gives you\ninstead of once the tool node gives you the output can't we give that output\nthe output can't we give that output\nthe output can't we give that output back to an LLM\nback to an LLM\nback to an LLM instead of sending this output to the\ninstead of sending this output to the\ninstead of sending this output to the end state.\nend state.\nend state. Now once we make this response back to\nNow once we make this response back to\nNow once we make this response back to the LLM then the LLM will be the main\nthe LLM then the LLM will be the main\nthe LLM then the LLM will be the main decision maker\ndecision maker\ndecision maker and this decision maker will help them\nand this decision maker will help them\nand this decision maker will help them to probably take up the next query\nto probably take up the next query\nto probably take up the next query multiply 5x2 and then it can again make\nmultiply 5x2 and then it can again make\nmultiply 5x2 and then it can again make a tool call because here I have my\na tool call because here I have my\na tool call because here I have my multiply function also and then once it\nmultiply function also and then once it\nmultiply function also and then once it gets the response it'll give it back to\ngets the response it'll give it back to\ngets the response it'll give it back to the LLM and it'll to combine both the\nthe LLM and it'll to combine both the\nthe LLM and it'll to combine both the output and give it till the end of the\noutput and give it till the end of the\noutput and give it till the end of the output. Give it at the end of the\noutput. Give it at the end of the\noutput. Give it at the end of the output.\noutput.\noutput. So this way of interaction of LLM with\nSo this way of interaction of LLM with\nSo this way of interaction of LLM with tools, right? It specifically uses a a\ntools, right? It specifically uses a a\ntools, right? It specifically uses a a very important kind of um you know there\nvery important kind of um you know there\nvery important kind of um you know there is a there is a very good communication\nis a there is a very good communication\nis a there is a very good communication that happens between LLM and tools and\nthat happens between LLM and tools and\nthat happens between LLM and tools and we use a kind of agent which is called\nwe use a kind of agent which is called\nwe use a kind of agent which is called as react agent.\nas react agent.\nas react agent. Okay. And this react agents plays a very\nOkay. And this react agents plays a very\nOkay. And this react agents plays a very important role altogether. Right? Now,\nimportant role altogether. Right? Now,\nimportant role altogether. Right? Now, first of all, what exactly is this react\nfirst of all, what exactly is this react\nfirst of all, what exactly is this react agent? You need to understand. Okay?\nagent? You need to understand. Okay?\nagent? You need to understand. Okay? Let me just go ahead and explain this in\nLet me just go ahead and explain this in\nLet me just go ahead and explain this in a better simpler example. Here I\na better simpler example. Here I\na better simpler example. Here I definitely have an LLM. Okay. Let's say\ndefinitely have an LLM. Okay. Let's say\ndefinitely have an LLM. Okay. Let's say this is my LLM.\nthis is my LLM.\nthis is my LLM. I ask a question. Okay. And you know\nI ask a question. Okay. And you know\nI ask a question. Okay. And you know that this LLM is nothing but it is the\nthat this LLM is nothing but it is the\nthat this LLM is nothing but it is the brain right. So here it is the brain\nbrain right. So here it is the brain\nbrain right. So here it is the brain right when I say brain this will be\nright when I say brain this will be\nright when I say brain this will be responsible in making the decision which\nresponsible in making the decision which\nresponsible in making the decision which tools to call and in the LLM I have some\ntools to call and in the LLM I have some\ntools to call and in the LLM I have some kind of binding tools.\nkind of binding tools.\nkind of binding tools. So here we go ahead and start.\nSo here we go ahead and start.\nSo here we go ahead and start. Here we go ahead and end\nHere we go ahead and end\nHere we go ahead and end right and here is my tools node.\nThis is my another node.\nThis is my another node. Okay. So let's say here I give my\nOkay. So let's say here I give my\nOkay. So let's say here I give my natural input.\nnatural input.\nnatural input. The natural input is that provide me the\nThe natural input is that provide me the\nThe natural input is that provide me the recent AI news. And along with this\nrecent AI news. And along with this\nrecent AI news. And along with this sentence I say hey multiply 5 by 5. Now\nsentence I say hey multiply 5 by 5. Now\nsentence I say hey multiply 5 by 5. Now LLM when it takes this specific input it\nLLM when it takes this specific input it\nLLM when it takes this specific input it breaks this into two sentences. So first\nbreaks this into two sentences. So first\nbreaks this into two sentences. So first it will try to serve this AI news. As I\nit will try to serve this AI news. As I\nit will try to serve this AI news. As I said this is the brain right? So what it\nsaid this is the brain right? So what it\nsaid this is the brain right? So what it does it knows it has to make a call to\ndoes it knows it has to make a call to\ndoes it knows it has to make a call to the tool node. Now with respect to the\nthe tool node. Now with respect to the\nthe tool node. Now with respect to the tool node it will get an output and\ntool node it will get an output and\ntool node it will get an output and instead of giving to the end what it\ninstead of giving to the end what it\ninstead of giving to the end what it will do it will come give the response\nwill do it will come give the response\nwill do it will come give the response to the LLM. Now the LLM will still have\nto the LLM. Now the LLM will still have\nto the LLM. Now the LLM will still have the second sentence context. Then what\nthe second sentence context. Then what\nthe second sentence context. Then what it will do? It will again make a tool\nit will do? It will again make a tool\nit will do? It will again make a tool call node. Why? Because this is five\ncall node. Why? Because this is five\ncall node. Why? Because this is five multiply by five. Right? So multiply is\nmultiply by five. Right? So multiply is\nmultiply by five. Right? So multiply is again there. It'll again go ahead and\nagain there. It'll again go ahead and\nagain there. It'll again go ahead and hit this particular tool node and again\nhit this particular tool node and again\nhit this particular tool node and again get the response. Then it will go ahead\nget the response. Then it will go ahead\nget the response. Then it will go ahead and see hey is there anything left in\nand see hey is there anything left in\nand see hey is there anything left in this particular sentence? Nothing is\nthis particular sentence? Nothing is\nthis particular sentence? Nothing is there. So what it is going to do? It is\nthere. So what it is going to do? It is\nthere. So what it is going to do? It is going to summarize and give you the\ngoing to summarize and give you the\ngoing to summarize and give you the output at the end. So this way of\noutput at the end. So this way of\noutput at the end. So this way of communication right this agent\ncommunication right this agent\ncommunication right this agent architecture is basically called as\narchitecture is basically called as\narchitecture is basically called as react agent architecture.\nreact agent architecture.\nreact agent architecture. In react there are three main key terms.\nIn react there are three main key terms.\nIn react there are three main key terms. One is act,\nOne is act,\nOne is act, second one is observe\nsecond one is observe\nsecond one is observe and third one is something called as\nand third one is something called as\nand third one is something called as reason.\nreason.\nreason. Act basically means whenever a input\nAct basically means whenever a input\nAct basically means whenever a input comes the LLM will be able to make a\ncomes the LLM will be able to make a\ncomes the LLM will be able to make a tool call. Right? Then when the output\ntool call. Right? Then when the output\ntool call. Right? Then when the output of the tool comes the LLM will observe\nof the tool comes the LLM will observe\nof the tool comes the LLM will observe okay the LLM will observe do I again\nokay the LLM will observe do I again\nokay the LLM will observe do I again need to make the tool call or should I\nneed to make the tool call or should I\nneed to make the tool call or should I directly go to the end let's say if this\ndirectly go to the end let's say if this\ndirectly go to the end let's say if this is a question again coming after that\nis a question again coming after that\nis a question again coming after that then again it makes a tool call okay and\nthen again it makes a tool call okay and\nthen again it makes a tool call okay and then again it is going to get the output\nthen again it is going to get the output\nthen again it is going to get the output reason basically means after it gets the\nreason basically means after it gets the\nreason basically means after it gets the output what the LLM should do that LLM\noutput what the LLM should do that LLM\noutput what the LLM should do that LLM is making the decision right and this is\nis making the decision right and this is\nis making the decision right and this is where your agent architecture comes into\nwhere your agent architecture comes into\nwhere your agent architecture comes into existence. That is where your agent\nexistence. That is where your agent\nexistence. That is where your agent behavior comes into existence. And this\nbehavior comes into existence. And this\nbehavior comes into existence. And this was the rise because of this now agentic\nwas the rise because of this now agentic\nwas the rise because of this now agentic AI has become very much popular. Okay,\nAI has become very much popular. Okay,\nAI has become very much popular. Okay, that is the reason why it has become\nthat is the reason why it has become\nthat is the reason why it has become really really popular. So in order to\nreally really popular. So in order to\nreally really popular. So in order to just implement this see I will I will\njust implement this see I will I will\njust implement this see I will I will just give you an example. So here if I\njust give you an example. So here if I\njust give you an example. So here if I want to go ahead and just use this\nwant to go ahead and just use this\nwant to go ahead and just use this react\nreact\nreact react agent architecture.\nreact agent architecture.\nreact agent architecture. Okay. how we are basically going to do\nOkay. how we are basically going to do\nOkay. how we are basically going to do this. Okay, I will just go ahead and use\nthis. Okay, I will just go ahead and use\nthis. Okay, I will just go ahead and use the same thing. See, I will use the same\nthe same thing. See, I will use the same\nthe same thing. See, I will use the same state graph\nstate graph\nstate graph this agent. Now you should tell me where\nthis agent. Now you should tell me where\nthis agent. Now you should tell me where the changes should happen. Okay, I will\nthe changes should happen. Okay, I will\nthe changes should happen. Okay, I will copy this over here\ncopy this over here\ncopy this over here from the tools. Instead of going back to\nfrom the tools. Instead of going back to\nfrom the tools. Instead of going back to the end, it should go back to tool\nthe end, it should go back to tool\nthe end, it should go back to tool calling\ncalling\ncalling LLM. Yes or no? Just think instead of\nLLM. Yes or no? Just think instead of\nLLM. Yes or no? Just think instead of going from tools to the end, it is now\ngoing from tools to the end, it is now\ngoing from tools to the end, it is now going to the tool calling LLM. Now how\ngoing to the tool calling LLM. Now how\ngoing to the tool calling LLM. Now how my diagram will look like? This is how\nmy diagram will look like? This is how\nmy diagram will look like? This is how it looks like from start tool calling\nit looks like from start tool calling\nit looks like from start tool calling LLM goes to the tool and again goes back\nLLM goes to the tool and again goes back\nLLM goes to the tool and again goes back to the tool calling LLM. And this can\nto the tool calling LLM. And this can\nto the tool calling LLM. And this can keep on repeating unless and until the\nkeep on repeating unless and until the\nkeep on repeating unless and until the answer is completely satisfied and the\nanswer is completely satisfied and the\nanswer is completely satisfied and the LLM is basically making the decision.\nLLM is basically making the decision.\nLLM is basically making the decision. Now if I go ahead and ask this question.\nNow if I go ahead and ask this question.\nNow if I go ahead and ask this question. Now see the magic. Okay,\nNow see the magic. Okay,\nNow see the magic. Okay, see the magic how good the output will\nsee the magic how good the output will\nsee the magic how good the output will come. Okay. So here if I make if I go\ncome. Okay. So here if I make if I go\ncome. Okay. So here if I make if I go ahead and probably just show you the\nahead and probably just show you the\nahead and probably just show you the output. Give me the recent AI news and\noutput. Give me the recent AI news and\noutput. Give me the recent AI news and then multiply 5 by 10. Now see LLM how\nthen multiply 5 by 10. Now see LLM how\nthen multiply 5 by 10. Now see LLM how it is going to behave. So give me the\nit is going to behave. So give me the\nit is going to behave. So give me the recent AI news multiply by this query\nrecent AI news multiply by this query\nrecent AI news multiply by this query tably search is happening perfect here's\ntably search is happening perfect here's\ntably search is happening perfect here's the recent AI news after this what has\nthe recent AI news after this what has\nthe recent AI news after this what has happened the response has gone back to\nhappened the response has gone back to\nhappened the response has gone back to the lm and then now multiply 5 by 10\nthe lm and then now multiply 5 by 10\nthe lm and then now multiply 5 by 10 which is nothing but 5 * 10 which is 50\nwhich is nothing but 5 * 10 which is 50\nwhich is nothing but 5 * 10 which is 50 and this is how your entire react agent\nand this is how your entire react agent\nand this is how your entire react agent works right and I hope you're able to\nworks right and I hope you're able to\nworks right and I hope you're able to understand this with this beautiful\nunderstand this with this beautiful\nunderstand this with this beautiful example that I have considered over here\nexample that I have considered over here\nexample that I have considered over here right and this is with respect to the\nright and this is with respect to the\nright and this is with respect to the react agent. So I hope you are able to\nreact agent. So I hope you are able to\nreact agent. So I hope you are able to understand this. Now you can keep on\nunderstand this. Now you can keep on\nunderstand this. Now you can keep on adding any number of tools. The LLM will\nadding any number of tools. The LLM will\nadding any number of tools. The LLM will be the deciding factor which tool to\nbe the deciding factor which tool to\nbe the deciding factor which tool to specifically call. So guys now we are\nspecifically call. So guys now we are\nspecifically call. So guys now we are going to go ahead and implement about\ngoing to go ahead and implement about\ngoing to go ahead and implement about adding memory in the agentic graph. Uh\nadding memory in the agentic graph. Uh\nadding memory in the agentic graph. Uh so whenever you create a graph you know\nso whenever you create a graph you know\nso whenever you create a graph you know uh langraph has a feature wherein you\nuh langraph has a feature wherein you\nuh langraph has a feature wherein you can go ahead and add memory and this\ncan go ahead and add memory and this\ncan go ahead and add memory and this memory actually solves a major problem\nmemory actually solves a major problem\nmemory actually solves a major problem you know that is nothing but persistent\nyou know that is nothing but persistent\nyou know that is nothing but persistent checkpointing.\ncheckpointing.\ncheckpointing. Now why do we specifically use this\nNow why do we specifically use this\nNow why do we specifically use this memory? Okay, so let me just give you\nmemory? Okay, so let me just give you\nmemory? Okay, so let me just give you some examples. So already if you know\nsome examples. So already if you know\nsome examples. So already if you know that uh we were able to invoke it from\nthat uh we were able to invoke it from\nthat uh we were able to invoke it from the previous uh graph that we have\nthe previous uh graph that we have\nthe previous uh graph that we have actually created. Now let's say that I\nactually created. Now let's say that I\nactually created. Now let's say that I will go ahead and ask a question. Hello\nwill go ahead and ask a question. Hello\nwill go ahead and ask a question. Hello uh my name is Kush. Okay. So let's say\nuh my name is Kush. Okay. So let's say\nuh my name is Kush. Okay. So let's say this is what I'm communicating with my\nthis is what I'm communicating with my\nthis is what I'm communicating with my chatbot. So my chatbot should be able to\nchatbot. So my chatbot should be able to\nchatbot. So my chatbot should be able to give me a good answer, right? It is\ngive me a good answer, right? It is\ngive me a good answer, right? It is going through this entire graph. uh over\ngoing through this entire graph. uh over\ngoing through this entire graph. uh over here the tool call is not required so\nhere the tool call is not required so\nhere the tool call is not required so directly it is going to the end after\ndirectly it is going to the end after\ndirectly it is going to the end after giving the answer right so let's say\ngiving the answer right so let's say\ngiving the answer right so let's say that here I've just asked hello my name\nthat here I've just asked hello my name\nthat here I've just asked hello my name is kish and it is able to probably\nis kish and it is able to probably\nis kish and it is able to probably provide a nice response saying that nice\nprovide a nice response saying that nice\nprovide a nice response saying that nice to meet you how are you today now what I\nto meet you how are you today now what I\nto meet you how are you today now what I will do I will again go ahead and ask a\nwill do I will again go ahead and ask a\nwill do I will again go ahead and ask a question what is my name okay what is my\nquestion what is my name okay what is my\nquestion what is my name okay what is my name what is my name so now what it is\nname what is my name so now what it is\nname what is my name so now what it is basically going to happen is that you\nbasically going to happen is that you\nbasically going to happen is that you see like what kind of response uh we\nsee like what kind of response uh we\nsee like what kind of response uh we will be able to get it over here. Now,\nwill be able to get it over here. Now,\nwill be able to get it over here. Now, what is my name? It is making this tool\nwhat is my name? It is making this tool\nwhat is my name? It is making this tool call. I apologize for the mistake\ncall. I apologize for the mistake\ncall. I apologize for the mistake earlier since the tool ID yielded. I\nearlier since the tool ID yielded. I\nearlier since the tool ID yielded. I will assume you're asking about your\nwill assume you're asking about your\nwill assume you're asking about your name again. Unfortunately, I don't have\nname again. Unfortunately, I don't have\nname again. Unfortunately, I don't have any information about your name and it's\nany information about your name and it's\nany information about your name and it's not provided in the conversation. Can\nnot provided in the conversation. Can\nnot provided in the conversation. Can you provide more context or clarity what\nyou provide more context or clarity what\nyou provide more context or clarity what you mean by name and all? So, see, I\nyou mean by name and all? So, see, I\nyou mean by name and all? So, see, I just now told my name and it also told\njust now told my name and it also told\njust now told my name and it also told me that hey, nice to meet you. How are\nme that hey, nice to meet you. How are\nme that hey, nice to meet you. How are you today? And now when I'm asking the\nyou today? And now when I'm asking the\nyou today? And now when I'm asking the same question, what is my name? It does\nsame question, what is my name? It does\nsame question, what is my name? It does not know. So it is not persisting that\nnot know. So it is not persisting that\nnot know. So it is not persisting that entire information uh with respect to\nentire information uh with respect to\nentire information uh with respect to the previous conversation or previous\nthe previous conversation or previous\nthe previous conversation or previous interaction that we had. Now lang graph\ninteraction that we had. Now lang graph\ninteraction that we had. Now lang graph has a very special property in order to\nhas a very special property in order to\nhas a very special property in order to overcome this advantage which is called\novercome this advantage which is called\novercome this advantage which is called as memory. Now for memory what we will\nas memory. Now for memory what we will\nas memory. Now for memory what we will do is that we will let's say that I'm\ndo is that we will let's say that I'm\ndo is that we will let's say that I'm going to use the same graph. Okay. So I\ngoing to use the same graph. Okay. So I\ngoing to use the same graph. Okay. So I will copy this and uh let's say I go\nwill copy this and uh let's say I go\nwill copy this and uh let's say I go ahead and paste it over here. Okay.\nahead and paste it over here. Okay.\nahead and paste it over here. Okay. Now once I paste it over here, langraph\nNow once I paste it over here, langraph\nNow once I paste it over here, langraph has a feature wherein you can create a\nhas a feature wherein you can create a\nhas a feature wherein you can create a memory saver checkpoint. Okay. Now how\nmemory saver checkpoint. Okay. Now how\nmemory saver checkpoint. Okay. Now how do I go ahead and create it? So here\ndo I go ahead and create it? So here\ndo I go ahead and create it? So here what I will do, I will just go ahead and\nwhat I will do, I will just go ahead and\nwhat I will do, I will just go ahead and write from langchain uh sorry lang graph\nwrite from langchain uh sorry lang graph\nwrite from langchain uh sorry lang graph dot checkpointer\ndot checkpointer\ndot checkpointer dot memory. Okay. And here uh we are\ndot memory. Okay. And here uh we are\ndot memory. Okay. And here uh we are langraph checkpointer memory. We going\nlangraph checkpointer memory. We going\nlangraph checkpointer memory. We going to go ahead and import. So let's see\nto go ahead and import. So let's see\nto go ahead and import. So let's see whether the spelling is correct.\nwhether the spelling is correct.\nwhether the spelling is correct. checkpointter domemory. So let me just\ncheckpointter domemory. So let me just\ncheckpointter domemory. So let me just go ahead and use this. And here you can\ngo ahead and use this. And here you can\ngo ahead and use this. And here you can see from langraph do checkpointer\nsee from langraph do checkpointer\nsee from langraph do checkpointer checkpoint dotmemory import memory saver\ncheckpoint dotmemory import memory saver\ncheckpoint dotmemory import memory saver and we go ahead and initialize this\nand we go ahead and initialize this\nand we go ahead and initialize this memory saver. Now what this exactly\nmemory saver. Now what this exactly\nmemory saver. Now what this exactly memory saver is it is nothing but it is\nmemory saver is it is nothing but it is\nmemory saver is it is nothing but it is an inmemory checkpoint saver. This\nan inmemory checkpoint saver. This\nan inmemory checkpoint saver. This checkpoint save stores checkpoints in\ncheckpoint save stores checkpoints in\ncheckpoint save stores checkpoints in memory using a default dictionary. Okay.\nmemory using a default dictionary. Okay.\nmemory using a default dictionary. Okay. So here if you go ahead and see that\nSo here if you go ahead and see that\nSo here if you go ahead and see that what it is going to do is that with\nwhat it is going to do is that with\nwhat it is going to do is that with respect to every node that it executes\nrespect to every node that it executes\nrespect to every node that it executes you know it is just going to go ahead\nyou know it is just going to go ahead\nyou know it is just going to go ahead and save all the information so that you\nand save all the information so that you\nand save all the information so that you can recall this particular memory again\ncan recall this particular memory again\ncan recall this particular memory again and again whenever it is required based\nand again whenever it is required based\nand again whenever it is required based on the previous interaction. Okay. Now\non the previous interaction. Okay. Now\non the previous interaction. Okay. Now where do we add the specific memory?\nwhere do we add the specific memory?\nwhere do we add the specific memory? This is really important. So here we\nThis is really important. So here we\nThis is really important. So here we have created a memory object. Where do\nhave created a memory object. Where do\nhave created a memory object. Where do we add it? While we are compiling there\nwe add it? While we are compiling there\nwe add it? While we are compiling there is a parameter which is called as\nis a parameter which is called as\nis a parameter which is called as checkpoint. We have to add this memory\ncheckpoint. We have to add this memory\ncheckpoint. We have to add this memory over here. Right? So once I go ahead and\nover here. Right? So once I go ahead and\nover here. Right? So once I go ahead and execute this now, now you can see that I\nexecute this now, now you can see that I\nexecute this now, now you can see that I have this exact uh right thing. Now what\nhave this exact uh right thing. Now what\nhave this exact uh right thing. Now what I'll do, I will just go ahead and u give\nI'll do, I will just go ahead and u give\nI'll do, I will just go ahead and u give some input. Okay. Now see if I want to\nsome input. Okay. Now see if I want to\nsome input. Okay. Now see if I want to use this specific memory, right, for a\nuse this specific memory, right, for a\nuse this specific memory, right, for a previous interaction or probably I want\nprevious interaction or probably I want\nprevious interaction or probably I want the context of the previous interaction.\nthe context of the previous interaction.\nthe context of the previous interaction. First of all, we need to go ahead and\nFirst of all, we need to go ahead and\nFirst of all, we need to go ahead and create a thread ID. This thread ID will\ncreate a thread ID. This thread ID will\ncreate a thread ID. This thread ID will be important because it will be related\nbe important because it will be related\nbe important because it will be related to one specific session. So we will go\nto one specific session. So we will go\nto one specific session. So we will go ahead and create a variable. Let's say I\nahead and create a variable. Let's say I\nahead and create a variable. Let's say I will just go ahead and create a web\nwill just go ahead and create a web\nwill just go ahead and create a web list. So this is memory obviously. Okay.\nlist. So this is memory obviously. Okay.\nlist. So this is memory obviously. Okay. And now I will just go ahead and create\nAnd now I will just go ahead and create\nAnd now I will just go ahead and create one config. Okay. Inside this config we\none config. Okay. Inside this config we\none config. Okay. Inside this config we will be using a key which will be called\nwill be using a key which will be called\nwill be using a key which will be called as configurable. And inside this\nas configurable. And inside this\nas configurable. And inside this configurable we are going to create one\nconfigurable we are going to create one\nconfigurable we are going to create one thread. And this thread any ID or any\nthread. And this thread any ID or any\nthread. And this thread any ID or any number that I'm giving it should be\nnumber that I'm giving it should be\nnumber that I'm giving it should be unique. Let's say I'm going to probably\nunique. Let's say I'm going to probably\nunique. Let's say I'm going to probably a user has joined a session. So I will\na user has joined a session. So I will\na user has joined a session. So I will go ahead and make a thread for that\ngo ahead and make a thread for that\ngo ahead and make a thread for that particular user. Okay. And this here is\nparticular user. Okay. And this here is\nparticular user. Okay. And this here is the configuration that we need to give\nthe configuration that we need to give\nthe configuration that we need to give right configurable key and there should\nright configurable key and there should\nright configurable key and there should be a thread with this particular key\nbe a thread with this particular key\nbe a thread with this particular key value pair. And this should be unique.\nvalue pair. And this should be unique.\nvalue pair. And this should be unique. So once I have provided my unique thread\nSo once I have provided my unique thread\nSo once I have provided my unique thread id now what I'm actually going to do is\nid now what I'm actually going to do is\nid now what I'm actually going to do is that I'm going to use this graph and I'm\nthat I'm going to use this graph and I'm\nthat I'm going to use this graph and I'm going to call the invoke method. Okay.\ngoing to call the invoke method. Okay.\ngoing to call the invoke method. Okay. Now once I call the invoke method here\nNow once I call the invoke method here\nNow once I call the invoke method here uh I'm going to basically give it in the\nuh I'm going to basically give it in the\nuh I'm going to basically give it in the form of keys right dictionary pairs. So\nform of keys right dictionary pairs. So\nform of keys right dictionary pairs. So here I'm going to basically go ahead and\nhere I'm going to basically go ahead and\nhere I'm going to basically go ahead and write messages.\nwrite messages.\nwrite messages. And now if I give the message saying\nAnd now if I give the message saying\nAnd now if I give the message saying that hi\nthat hi\nthat hi my name is crush. Now see what will be\nmy name is crush. Now see what will be\nmy name is crush. Now see what will be the magic that will happen. Okay. So\nthe magic that will happen. Okay. So\nthe magic that will happen. Okay. So here huh apart from this right the\nhere huh apart from this right the\nhere huh apart from this right the messages that we are giving we also have\nmessages that we are giving we also have\nmessages that we are giving we also have to make sure that for which thread ID I\nto make sure that for which thread ID I\nto make sure that for which thread ID I am providing the configuration. So here\nam providing the configuration. So here\nam providing the configuration. So here there will be one more additional\nthere will be one more additional\nthere will be one more additional parameter which is called as config and\nparameter which is called as config and\nparameter which is called as config and we will provide this particular config.\nwe will provide this particular config.\nwe will provide this particular config. Right. So once we get the response\nRight. So once we get the response\nRight. So once we get the response response\nresponse\nresponse I will just go ahead and print this\nI will just go ahead and print this\nI will just go ahead and print this response. So this will be graph uh let's\nresponse. So this will be graph uh let's\nresponse. So this will be graph uh let's go ahead and print it. Okay response.\ngo ahead and print it. Okay response.\ngo ahead and print it. Okay response. Perfect.\nPerfect.\nPerfect. Now I should be able to get my uh\nNow I should be able to get my uh\nNow I should be able to get my uh output. So here you can see that output\noutput. So here you can see that output\noutput. So here you can see that output is nothing but this all information is\nis nothing but this all information is\nis nothing but this all information is there. Hi my name is Kish and it says\nthere. Hi my name is Kish and it says\nthere. Hi my name is Kish and it says nice to meet you. All this information\nnice to meet you. All this information\nnice to meet you. All this information is there. Right now what I will do I\nis there. Right now what I will do I\nis there. Right now what I will do I will quickly go ahead and write response\nwill quickly go ahead and write response\nwill quickly go ahead and write response or let me do one thing because I think\nor let me do one thing because I think\nor let me do one thing because I think it got appended two times. Okay, I'll\nit got appended two times. Okay, I'll\nit got appended two times. Okay, I'll execute this once again and let's just\nexecute this once again and let's just\nexecute this once again and let's just execute it for one time. Okay, so with\nexecute it for one time. Okay, so with\nexecute it for one time. Okay, so with this particular thread ID, we will just\nthis particular thread ID, we will just\nthis particular thread ID, we will just execute it for one time. Um and now here\nexecute it for one time. Um and now here\nexecute it for one time. Um and now here you can see that I'm getting one human\nyou can see that I'm getting one human\nyou can see that I'm getting one human message, one AI message. Nice to meet\nmessage, one AI message. Nice to meet\nmessage, one AI message. Nice to meet you. Now if I just go ahead and see the\nyou. Now if I just go ahead and see the\nyou. Now if I just go ahead and see the last messages, so it'll be messages of\nlast messages, so it'll be messages of\nlast messages, so it'll be messages of minus one. So here you can see that if I\nminus one. So here you can see that if I\nminus one. So here you can see that if I go ahead and see this particular\ngo ahead and see this particular\ngo ahead and see this particular content, I should be able to see the\ncontent, I should be able to see the\ncontent, I should be able to see the output. Okay. Hi, nice to meet you\noutput. Okay. Hi, nice to meet you\noutput. Okay. Hi, nice to meet you crush. Is there something I can help you\ncrush. Is there something I can help you\ncrush. Is there something I can help you with? Okay. Now let's go ahead and again\nwith? Okay. Now let's go ahead and again\nwith? Okay. Now let's go ahead and again use the same config and let me now ask\nuse the same config and let me now ask\nuse the same config and let me now ask hey what is my name? Okay. Now let's see\nhey what is my name? Okay. Now let's see\nhey what is my name? Okay. Now let's see whether it'll be able to remember or not\nwhether it'll be able to remember or not\nwhether it'll be able to remember or not because we have already used memory\nbecause we have already used memory\nbecause we have already used memory saver and it is uh putting everything in\nsaver and it is uh putting everything in\nsaver and it is uh putting everything in that uh memory saver itself. Right? So\nthat uh memory saver itself. Right? So\nthat uh memory saver itself. Right? So the previous interaction context it'll\nthe previous interaction context it'll\nthe previous interaction context it'll be able to remember it. Hey, what is my\nbe able to remember it. Hey, what is my\nbe able to remember it. Hey, what is my name? Okay, so I'm just going to go\nname? Okay, so I'm just going to go\nname? Okay, so I'm just going to go ahead and do this and we are going to\nahead and do this and we are going to\nahead and do this and we are going to print this particular output. Okay, so\nprint this particular output. Okay, so\nprint this particular output. Okay, so we are going to print this output and\nwe are going to print this output and\nwe are going to print this output and remember we giving the same config.\nremember we giving the same config.\nremember we giving the same config. Okay, see when you create a end toend\nOkay, see when you create a end toend\nOkay, see when you create a end toend application this dynamic uh uh you know\napplication this dynamic uh uh you know\napplication this dynamic uh uh you know ID thread id will be maintained in the\nID thread id will be maintained in the\nID thread id will be maintained in the session itself. So that way we'll be\nsession itself. So that way we'll be\nsession itself. So that way we'll be able to maintain this entirely in the\nable to maintain this entirely in the\nable to maintain this entirely in the memory saver. Right? So here now it is\nmemory saver. Right? So here now it is\nmemory saver. Right? So here now it is able to understand that hey your name is\nable to understand that hey your name is\nable to understand that hey your name is crash. Okay. Uh, so this is really nice,\ncrash. Okay. Uh, so this is really nice,\ncrash. Okay. Uh, so this is really nice, right? Now it is able to remember. Do\nright? Now it is able to remember. Do\nright? Now it is able to remember. Do you know what is my name? Uh, hey, do\nyou know what is my name? Uh, hey, do\nyou know what is my name? Uh, hey, do you remember me? I'll just go ahead and\nyou remember me? I'll just go ahead and\nyou remember me? I'll just go ahead and write like this. Remember me? Right.\nwrite like this. Remember me? Right.\nwrite like this. Remember me? Right. This is the beginning of so I don't have\nThis is the beginning of so I don't have\nThis is the beginning of so I don't have previous memory of you. I have my large\nprevious memory of you. I have my large\nprevious memory of you. I have my large language model and all. Okay. Do you\nlanguage model and all. Okay. Do you\nlanguage model and all. Okay. Do you remember my name? Let's let's go ahead\nremember my name? Let's let's go ahead\nremember my name? Let's let's go ahead and ask this question. Do you remember\nand ask this question. Do you remember\nand ask this question. Do you remember my name? So it will be able to remember\nmy name? So it will be able to remember\nmy name? So it will be able to remember me. My name at least. Yes, your name is\nme. My name at least. Yes, your name is\nme. My name at least. Yes, your name is Kush, right? So it is able to answer\nKush, right? So it is able to answer\nKush, right? So it is able to answer that right. So guys now we are going to\nthat right. So guys now we are going to\nthat right. So guys now we are going to discuss about streaming and lang graph.\ndiscuss about streaming and lang graph.\ndiscuss about streaming and lang graph. See most of the time whenever we want to\nSee most of the time whenever we want to\nSee most of the time whenever we want to probably invoke or chat with our chatbot\nprobably invoke or chat with our chatbot\nprobably invoke or chat with our chatbot we were basically using this\nwe were basically using this\nwe were basically using this graph.invoke method right and somewhere\ngraph.invoke method right and somewhere\ngraph.invoke method right and somewhere we also use stream right now let's go\nwe also use stream right now let's go\nwe also use stream right now let's go ahead and try to see like what are the\nahead and try to see like what are the\nahead and try to see like what are the different streaming techniques to\ndifferent streaming techniques to\ndifferent streaming techniques to probably get the response uh from the\nprobably get the response uh from the\nprobably get the response uh from the chatbot itself when we executing a\nchatbot itself when we executing a\nchatbot itself when we executing a graph. So first of all what I'm actually\ngraph. So first of all what I'm actually\ngraph. So first of all what I'm actually going to do is that I will go ahead and\ngoing to do is that I will go ahead and\ngoing to do is that I will go ahead and uh implement some of the things like\nuh implement some of the things like\nuh implement some of the things like let's say I will go ahead and initialize\nlet's say I will go ahead and initialize\nlet's say I will go ahead and initialize my memory saver. Okay. Now inside this\nmy memory saver. Okay. Now inside this\nmy memory saver. Okay. Now inside this memory saver we are basically just\nmemory saver we are basically just\nmemory saver we are basically just creating a memory object. I will go\ncreating a memory object. I will go\ncreating a memory object. I will go ahead and create one node definition and\nahead and create one node definition and\nahead and create one node definition and this node is nothing but the name is\nthis node is nothing but the name is\nthis node is nothing but the name is superbot and here we are going to use\nsuperbot and here we are going to use\nsuperbot and here we are going to use llm with tool.invoke. Okay or I can just\nllm with tool.invoke. Okay or I can just\nllm with tool.invoke. Okay or I can just go ahead and use llm right? I'll just\ngo ahead and use llm right? I'll just\ngo ahead and use llm right? I'll just create a simple graph to probably show\ncreate a simple graph to probably show\ncreate a simple graph to probably show you what are the different types of\nyou what are the different types of\nyou what are the different types of streaming that is available over here.\nstreaming that is available over here.\nstreaming that is available over here. Right now let's go ahead and execute\nRight now let's go ahead and execute\nRight now let's go ahead and execute this now. Here is my entire chatbot node\nthis now. Here is my entire chatbot node\nthis now. Here is my entire chatbot node that is available over here. Right now I\nthat is available over here. Right now I\nthat is available over here. Right now I will just go ahead and create my entire\nwill just go ahead and create my entire\nwill just go ahead and create my entire graph. So let's say this is a very\ngraph. So let's say this is a very\ngraph. So let's say this is a very simple graph wherein I am trying to\nsimple graph wherein I am trying to\nsimple graph wherein I am trying to create a node called a superbot. The\ncreate a node called a superbot. The\ncreate a node called a superbot. The functionality is nothing but superbot\nfunctionality is nothing but superbot\nfunctionality is nothing but superbot here from start to superbot superbot to\nhere from start to superbot superbot to\nhere from start to superbot superbot to end and then we are compiling it with a\nend and then we are compiling it with a\nend and then we are compiling it with a checkpointer memory right and this is\ncheckpointer memory right and this is\ncheckpointer memory right and this is how my graph looks like very simple\nhow my graph looks like very simple\nhow my graph looks like very simple graph I think uh we are learning a lot\ngraph I think uh we are learning a lot\ngraph I think uh we are learning a lot right out over here uh from that much\nright out over here uh from that much\nright out over here uh from that much time like in this entire session we have\ntime like in this entire session we have\ntime like in this entire session we have understood how to create different\nunderstood how to create different\nunderstood how to create different different types of graph now what I will\ndifferent types of graph now what I will\ndifferent types of graph now what I will do I will go ahead and create a thread\ndo I will go ahead and create a thread\ndo I will go ahead and create a thread let's say the thread is one I'll say hey\nlet's say the thread is one I'll say hey\nlet's say the thread is one I'll say hey my name is Krish and I like cricket and\nmy name is Krish and I like cricket and\nmy name is Krish and I like cricket and I will give this particular config and\nI will give this particular config and\nI will give this particular config and I'm just going to go ahead and invoke\nI'm just going to go ahead and invoke\nI'm just going to go ahead and invoke it. Okay. Now when we are invoking it,\nit. Okay. Now when we are invoking it,\nit. Okay. Now when we are invoking it, you can see there are some information\nyou can see there are some information\nyou can see there are some information that you are seeing, right? One is human\nthat you are seeing, right? One is human\nthat you are seeing, right? One is human message, one is the AI message. AI\nmessage, one is the AI message. AI\nmessage, one is the AI message. AI message is basically the response. Now\nmessage is basically the response. Now\nmessage is basically the response. Now with respect to this, we are going to\nwith respect to this, we are going to\nwith respect to this, we are going to learn about three some streaming\nlearn about three some streaming\nlearn about three some streaming techniques. Okay. And this will be very\ntechniques. Okay. And this will be very\ntechniques. Okay. And this will be very very handful when you try to develop\nvery handful when you try to develop\nvery handful when you try to develop some kind of chatbot. Okay. So inside\nsome kind of chatbot. Okay. So inside\nsome kind of chatbot. Okay. So inside the streaming you have dot stream method\nthe streaming you have dot stream method\nthe streaming you have dot stream method and a stream method. The methods are\nand a stream method. The methods are\nand a stream method. The methods are sync and a sync method for string being\nsync and a sync method for string being\nsync and a sync method for string being back results. And inside the stream and\nback results. And inside the stream and\nback results. And inside the stream and all stream method, you have this two\nall stream method, you have this two\nall stream method, you have this two parameters. One is value. Okay. And one\nparameters. One is value. Okay. And one\nparameters. One is value. Okay. And one is nothing but updates. Now the question\nis nothing but updates. Now the question\nis nothing but updates. Now the question rises what exactly is the difference\nrises what exactly is the difference\nrises what exactly is the difference between values and updates? So in order\nbetween values and updates? So in order\nbetween values and updates? So in order to make you understand, let me go back\nto make you understand, let me go back\nto make you understand, let me go back over here. Okay, let's say I have a and\nover here. Okay, let's say I have a and\nover here. Okay, let's say I have a and this is related to streaming, right? to\nthis is related to streaming, right? to\nthis is related to streaming, right? to in order to make you understand what is\nin order to make you understand what is\nin order to make you understand what is the differences between value and\nthe differences between value and\nthe differences between value and updates that is what we are going to\nupdates that is what we are going to\nupdates that is what we are going to discuss okay so let's say this is my\ndiscuss okay so let's say this is my\ndiscuss okay so let's say this is my streaming right streaming topic so first\nstreaming right streaming topic so first\nstreaming right streaming topic so first of all let's say I have this graph\nof all let's say I have this graph\nof all let's say I have this graph inside this graph I have various nodes\ninside this graph I have various nodes\ninside this graph I have various nodes let's say I have node one\nlet's say I have node one\nlet's say I have node one I have node one\nI have node one\nI have node one I have node two that gets executed and\nI have node two that gets executed and\nI have node two that gets executed and then finally I have node three and the\nthen finally I have node three and the\nthen finally I have node three and the flow of execution is in this direction\nflow of execution is in this direction\nflow of execution is in this direction right\nright\nright and we are discussing about stream and\nand we are discussing about stream and\nand we are discussing about stream and earth stream methods there is a stream\nearth stream methods there is a stream\nearth stream methods there is a stream method then there is an earth stream\nmethod then there is an earth stream\nmethod then there is an earth stream method in order to understand the\nmethod in order to understand the\nmethod in order to understand the difference between stream and earth\ndifference between stream and earth\ndifference between stream and earth stream this is like specifically used\nstream this is like specifically used\nstream this is like specifically used for a sync okay now if you know Python I\nfor a sync okay now if you know Python I\nfor a sync okay now if you know Python I think you should get an idea about what\nthink you should get an idea about what\nthink you should get an idea about what is sync and a sync basically means right\nis sync and a sync basically means right\nis sync and a sync basically means right but the main important point that I'm\nbut the main important point that I'm\nbut the main important point that I'm really interested in is understanding\nreally interested in is understanding\nreally interested in is understanding about modes\nabout modes\nabout modes So inside this method you have two\nSo inside this method you have two\nSo inside this method you have two modes. One is update mode and one is\nmodes. One is update mode and one is\nmodes. One is update mode and one is value mode.\nvalue mode.\nvalue mode. Okay. Where is value mode. Okay. Now\nOkay. Where is value mode. Okay. Now\nOkay. Where is value mode. Okay. Now what is the difference between update\nwhat is the difference between update\nwhat is the difference between update mode and value mode? And we will play\nmode and value mode? And we will play\nmode and value mode? And we will play with this parameter. Okay. This is an\nwith this parameter. Okay. This is an\nwith this parameter. Okay. This is an additional parameter we give. Let's say\nadditional parameter we give. Let's say\nadditional parameter we give. Let's say over here in node one as soon as the\nover here in node one as soon as the\nover here in node one as soon as the node one gets executed here my messages\nnode one gets executed here my messages\nnode one gets executed here my messages variable will be equal to let's say hi.\nvariable will be equal to let's say hi.\nvariable will be equal to let's say hi. Let's say my LLM gives a high message\nLet's say my LLM gives a high message\nLet's say my LLM gives a high message when node one is executed. When node two\nwhen node one is executed. When node two\nwhen node one is executed. When node two is executed, the messages will probably\nis executed, the messages will probably\nis executed, the messages will probably have another information like my name is\nhave another information like my name is\nhave another information like my name is okay. So this will be my another\nokay. So this will be my another\nokay. So this will be my another information and when node 3 executes\ninformation and when node 3 executes\ninformation and when node 3 executes my current message\nmy current message\nmy current message that is being getting updated okay is\nthat is being getting updated okay is\nthat is being getting updated okay is nothing but crush.\nnothing but crush.\nnothing but crush. So this is a very simple thing. When\nSo this is a very simple thing. When\nSo this is a very simple thing. When node one gets executed, my uh current\nnode one gets executed, my uh current\nnode one gets executed, my uh current output response is high. Then node two\noutput response is high. Then node two\noutput response is high. Then node two gets executed, my current response is my\ngets executed, my current response is my\ngets executed, my current response is my name is. And when node 3 is getting\nname is. And when node 3 is getting\nname is. And when node 3 is getting executed, it is nothing but kish. Okay.\nexecuted, it is nothing but kish. Okay.\nexecuted, it is nothing but kish. Okay. Now if I use mode is equal to update,\nNow if I use mode is equal to update,\nNow if I use mode is equal to update, only the message that is currently\nonly the message that is currently\nonly the message that is currently getting updated only that message will\ngetting updated only that message will\ngetting updated only that message will get displayed as an output. Okay. Let's\nget displayed as an output. Okay. Let's\nget displayed as an output. Okay. Let's say if node one is getting executed if I\nsay if node one is getting executed if I\nsay if node one is getting executed if I just go ahead and print or do the\njust go ahead and print or do the\njust go ahead and print or do the streaming with respect to mode is equal\nstreaming with respect to mode is equal\nstreaming with respect to mode is equal to update only this message will get\nto update only this message will get\nto update only this message will get updated right let's say after executing\nupdated right let's say after executing\nupdated right let's say after executing all these three nodes this is the\nall these three nodes this is the\nall these three nodes this is the message that is getting executed again I\nmessage that is getting executed again I\nmessage that is getting executed again I go ahead and give my another input then\ngo ahead and give my another input then\ngo ahead and give my another input then this message will get generated then\nthis message will get generated then\nthis message will get generated then this message will get generated whereas\nthis message will get generated whereas\nthis message will get generated whereas in the case of values you know in the\nin the case of values you know in the\nin the case of values you know in the first case I will get a message as hi\nfirst case I will get a message as hi\nfirst case I will get a message as hi okay but when again I give the message\nokay but when again I give the message\nokay but when again I give the message this message is equal to high will also\nthis message is equal to high will also\nthis message is equal to high will also get appended ended and it will come as\nget appended ended and it will come as\nget appended ended and it will come as my name is in the form of list right so\nmy name is in the form of list right so\nmy name is in the form of list right so this is basically getting appended over\nthis is basically getting appended over\nthis is basically getting appended over here right when I try to stream with the\nhere right when I try to stream with the\nhere right when I try to stream with the help of mode is equal to value similarly\nhelp of mode is equal to value similarly\nhelp of mode is equal to value similarly when I go to my again I give an input\nwhen I go to my again I give an input\nwhen I go to my again I give an input and execute all the specific nodes then\nand execute all the specific nodes then\nand execute all the specific nodes then here you'll be able to see that I'll get\nhere you'll be able to see that I'll get\nhere you'll be able to see that I'll get another message which will say hi my\nanother message which will say hi my\nanother message which will say hi my name is Kish right so this is how it\nname is Kish right so this is how it\nname is Kish right so this is how it gets executed right here in a specific\ngets executed right here in a specific\ngets executed right here in a specific execution what is one of the message\nexecution what is one of the message\nexecution what is one of the message that gets appended or that gets uh\nthat gets appended or that gets uh\nthat gets appended or that gets uh displayed that only I will be able to\ndisplayed that only I will be able to\ndisplayed that only I will be able to see it okay so that is a basic\nsee it okay so that is a basic\nsee it okay so that is a basic difference between mode is equal to\ndifference between mode is equal to\ndifference between mode is equal to update and value but if you still have\nupdate and value but if you still have\nupdate and value but if you still have confusion we'll try to understand this\nconfusion we'll try to understand this\nconfusion we'll try to understand this uh with an example over here okay so now\nuh with an example over here okay so now\nuh with an example over here okay so now what I'm actually going to uh\nwhat I'm actually going to uh\nwhat I'm actually going to uh specifically do is that uh now uh you\nspecifically do is that uh now uh you\nspecifically do is that uh now uh you can see over here that I have this okay\ncan see over here that I have this okay\ncan see over here that I have this okay my name is this and all okay now what I\nmy name is this and all okay now what I\nmy name is this and all okay now what I will do I will use the stream or stream\nwill do I will use the stream or stream\nwill do I will use the stream or stream method whichever method you specifically\nmethod whichever method you specifically\nmethod whichever method you specifically want we can use this okay so let's say\nwant we can use this okay so let's say\nwant we can use this okay so let's say that I go ahead and create a thread and\nthat I go ahead and create a thread and\nthat I go ahead and create a thread and this particular thread has for chunk and\nthis particular thread has for chunk and\nthis particular thread has for chunk and graph builder dotstream and I'm giving\ngraph builder dotstream and I'm giving\ngraph builder dotstream and I'm giving this message my name is Krishna I like\nthis message my name is Krishna I

one is updates and one is values now with respect to updates if I\nvalues now with respect to updates if I\nvalues now with respect to updates if I just go ahead and print it okay now see\njust go ahead and print it okay now see\njust go ahead and print it okay now see what will be the output that I'll get\nwhat will be the output that I'll get\nwhat will be the output that I'll get okay so it shows that what is the\nokay so it shows that what is the\nokay so it shows that what is the current execution AI message that is\ncurrent execution AI message that is\ncurrent execution AI message that is what I'm actually getting. I did not get\nwhat I'm actually getting. I did not get\nwhat I'm actually getting. I did not get the human message. See, focus in this.\nthe human message. See, focus in this.\nthe human message.

But if I just go ahead and\ndisplayed. But if I just go ahead and\ndisplayed. But if I just go ahead and execute the same thing, instead of\nexecute the same thing, instead of\nexecute the same thing, instead of writing mode is equal to updates, I will\nwriting mode is equal to updates, I will\nwriting mode is equal to updates, I will go ahead and write mode is equal to\ngo ahead and write mode is equal to\ngo ahead and write mode is equal to values. If I execute it here, you can\nvalues. If I execute it here, you can\nvalues. If I execute it here, you can see human message. Here also you can see\nsee human message.

And if you for go forward, your AI\nAnd if you for go forward, your AI\nAnd if you for go forward, your AI message will also get appended over\nmessage will also get appended over\nmessage will also get appended over here. See AI message, right? So all the\nhere. See AI message, right? So all the\nhere. See AI message, right? So all the conversation is basically getting\nconversation is basically getting\nconversation is basically getting updated right when you whether you give\nupdated right when you whether you give\nupdated right when you whether you give an input whatever output you get here\nan input whatever output you get here\nan input whatever output you get here specifically output you're getting okay\nspecifically output you're getting okay\nspecifically output you're getting okay here specifically output you're actually\nhere specifically output you're actually\nhere specifically output you're actually getting right again again let me repeat\ngetting right again again let me repeat\ngetting right again again let me repeat this over here you'll be able to see\nthis over here you'll be able to see\nthis over here you'll be able to see that whatever output you get after any\nthat whatever output you get after any\nthat whatever output you get after any node and if you try to stream it only\nnode and if you try to stream it only\nnode and if you try to stream it only that is basically getting displayed this\nthat is basically getting displayed this\nthat is basically getting displayed this is the AI message over here whereas in\nis the AI message over here whereas in\nis the AI message over here whereas in the case of mode is equal to value\nthe case of mode is equal to value\nthe case of mode is equal to value everything is getting displayed your\neverything is getting displayed your\neverything is getting displayed your human message your AI message everything\nhuman message your AI message everything\nhuman message your AI message everything is getting displayed so that is the\nis getting displayed so that is the\nis getting displayed so that is the basic difference between this modes and\nbasic difference between this modes and\nbasic difference between this modes and values. Okay. So now I hope you get this\nvalues. Okay. So now I hope you get this\nvalues. Okay. So now I hope you get this clear understanding. Okay. And let's say\nclear understanding. Okay. And let's say\nclear understanding. Okay. And let's say that I go ahead and add one more\nthat I go ahead and add one more\nthat I go ahead and add one more message. Okay. I'll say hey um see I\nmessage. Okay. I'll say hey um see I\nmessage. Okay. I'll say hey um see I executed this two times, right? This is\nexecuted this two times, right? This is\nexecuted this two times, right? This is the first time. This is my human message\nthe first time. This is my human message\nthe first time. This is my human message and here also I got the AI message and\nand here also I got the AI message and\nand here also I got the AI message and everything is basically getting updated.\neverything is basically getting updated.\neverything is basically getting updated. Let's say I go ahead and add one more\nLet's say I go ahead and add one more\nLet's say I go ahead and add one more method or or or I just go ahead and\nmethod or or or I just go ahead and\nmethod or or or I just go ahead and create one new key. Okay. Okay. So let's\ncreate one new key. Okay. Okay. So let's\ncreate one new key. Okay. Okay. So let's let's create this. Okay. And uh you'll\nlet's create this. Okay. And uh you'll\nlet's create this. Okay. And uh you'll be able to understand this very clearly.\nbe able to understand this very clearly.\nbe able to understand this very clearly. So here I will just go ahead and use\nSo here I will just go ahead and use\nSo here I will just go ahead and use thread is equal to 4. Okay. I'll say hi.\nthread is equal to 4. Okay. I'll say hi.\nthread is equal to 4. Okay. I'll say hi. Hi my name is Krish. I like cricket.\nHi my name is Krish. I like cricket.\nHi my name is Krish. I like cricket. Okay. Let's start from fresh. So here\nOkay. Let's start from fresh. So here\nOkay. Let's start from fresh. So here now mode is equal to update is update.\nnow mode is equal to update is update.\nnow mode is equal to update is update. Now I will be getting the AI message\nNow I will be getting the AI message\nNow I will be getting the AI message over here. Obviously since I've used\nover here. Obviously since I've used\nover here. Obviously since I've used this. So I've got the AI message. Now\nthis. So I've got the AI message. Now\nthis. So I've got the AI message. Now again I will go ahead and use another\nagain I will go ahead and use another\nagain I will go ahead and use another message over here and I'll say I also\nmessage over here and I'll say I also\nmessage over here and I'll say I also like\nlike\nlike I also like football. Okay. Now see what\nI also like football. Okay. Now see what\nI also like football. Okay. Now see what will happen if I make this updates to\nwill happen if I make this updates to\nwill happen if I make this updates to values. Okay. Now see if I go ahead and\nvalues. Okay. Now see if I go ahead and\nvalues. Okay. Now see if I go ahead and print the churn I'm getting the human\nprint the churn I'm getting the human\nprint the churn I'm getting the human message. My name is Kish. I like\nmessage. My name is Kish. I like\nmessage. My name is Kish. I like cricket. So this is saved in the memory.\ncricket. So this is saved in the memory.\ncricket. So this is saved in the memory. My next prompt will be something related\nMy next prompt will be something related\nMy next prompt will be something related to I also like football. You can see\nto I also like football. You can see\nto I also like football. You can see this. Okay. So let this get printed.\nthis. Okay. So let this get printed.\nthis. Okay. So let this get printed. It is still executing.\nIt is still executing.\nIt is still executing. So right now I got this human message.\nSo right now I got this human message.\nSo right now I got this human message. In the next sentence the previous\nIn the next sentence the previous\nIn the next sentence the previous conversation has also got attached.\nconversation has also got attached.\nconversation has also got attached. Right? Previous conversation has also\nRight? Previous conversation has also\nRight? Previous conversation has also got attached. And then probably after\ngot attached. And then probably after\ngot attached. And then probably after some time when this gets executed you'll\nsome time when this gets executed you'll\nsome time when this gets executed you'll be able to see that one more message\nbe able to see that one more message\nbe able to see that one more message will get appended and that is related to\nwill get appended and that is related to\nwill get appended and that is related to human message. See my name is Kish. I\nhuman message. See my name is Kish. I\nhuman message. See my name is Kish. I like cricket. The previous one along\nlike cricket. The previous one along\nlike cricket. The previous one along with that uh hi Kish nice to meet you.\nwith that uh hi Kish nice to meet you.\nwith that uh hi Kish nice to meet you. So you also like cricket which team do\nSo you also like cricket which team do\nSo you also like cricket which team do you support? He's asked the question and\nyou support? He's asked the question and\nyou support? He's asked the question and if you go forward here you can see AI\nif you go forward here you can see AI\nif you go forward here you can see AI message a sport fan with diverse effect.\nmessage a sport fan with diverse effect.\nmessage a sport fan with diverse effect. Now see here somewhere human message I\nNow see here somewhere human message I\nNow see here somewhere human message I also like football has got added and\nalso like football has got added and\nalso like football has got added and here you got the response. So values\nhere you got the response. So values\nhere you got the response. So values what it is doing is that it is keep on\nwhat it is doing is that it is keep on\nwhat it is doing is that it is keep on adding all the conversation inside this\nadding all the conversation inside this\nadding all the conversation inside this and you're able to stream through that\nand you're able to stream through that\nand you're able to stream through that entire information. Sometime this\nentire information. Sometime this\nentire information. Sometime this becomes uh very good in use cases where\nbecomes uh very good in use cases where\nbecomes uh very good in use cases where you are focused on understanding about\nyou are focused on understanding about\nyou are focused on understanding about things and all right and uh if you want\nthings and all right and uh if you want\nthings and all right and uh if you want some more detailed information and all\nsome more detailed information and all\nsome more detailed information and all now there is one more uh method which is\nnow there is one more uh method which is\nnow there is one more uh method which is called as a stream methods okay and for\ncalled as a stream methods okay and for\ncalled as a stream methods okay and for this you just need to probably go ahead\nthis you just need to probably go ahead\nthis you just need to probably go ahead and use like this see I'm using another\nand use like this see I'm using another\nand use like this see I'm using another thread id let's say thread id will be\nthread id let's say thread id will be\nthread id let's say thread id will be five here we are using graph\nfive here we are using graph\nfive here we are using graph builduerstream events and uh here you\nbuilduerstream events and uh here you\nbuilduerstream events and uh here you can use the config version each and\ncan use the config version each and\ncan use the config version each and information. If you just print this\ninformation. If you just print this\ninformation. If you just print this particular event, no more detailed\nparticular event, no more detailed\nparticular event, no more detailed information on different different\ninformation on different different\ninformation on different different things, different different events. So\nthings, different different events. So\nthings, different different events. So there are multiple events that are\nthere are multiple events that are\nthere are multiple events that are present over there. Right? So if you\npresent over there. Right? So if you\npresent over there. Right? So if you want much more detailed information just\nwant much more detailed information just\nwant much more detailed information just to do the debugging and all with respect\nto do the debugging and all with respect\nto do the debugging and all with respect to every sentences, you can specifically\nto every sentences, you can specifically\nto every sentences, you can specifically use this streaming technique. Right?\nuse this streaming technique. Right?\nuse this streaming technique. Right? So now guys, we are going to discuss\nSo now guys, we are going to discuss\nSo now guys, we are going to discuss about a new topic in langraph which is\nabout a new topic in langraph which is\nabout a new topic in langraph which is called as human in the loop. Now human\ncalled as human in the loop. Now human\ncalled as human in the loop. Now human enabler loop can also be called as human\nenabler loop can also be called as human\nenabler loop can also be called as human feedback. In order to explain you, let's\nfeedback. In order to explain you, let's\nfeedback. In order to explain you, let's make sure to take an example. Okay. So\nmake sure to take an example. Okay. So\nmake sure to take an example. Okay. So let's say that uh I have a specific\nlet's say that uh I have a specific\nlet's say that uh I have a specific example. Let's say I will just go ahead\nexample. Let's say I will just go ahead\nexample. Let's say I will just go ahead and draw one of the you know the same\nand draw one of the you know the same\nand draw one of the you know the same thing that what we are specifically\nthing that what we are specifically\nthing that what we are specifically doing right let's let's consider that\ndoing right let's let's consider that\ndoing right let's let's consider that here I have this start node then I have\nhere I have this start node then I have\nhere I have this start node then I have one more node. Let's say this is my lm\none more node. Let's say this is my lm\none more node. Let's say this is my lm zip tool. This is my tool node. And\nzip tool. This is my tool node. And\nzip tool. This is my tool node. And finally this is my end node. Okay.\nfinally this is my end node. Okay.\nfinally this is my end node. Okay. Now here we know that let's say that\nNow here we know that let's say that\nNow here we know that let's say that here we have this start.\nhere we have this start.\nhere we have this start. Okay. So this is start\nstart. Let's say this is my chatbot.\nstart. Let's say this is my chatbot. This chatbot has been binded with\nThis chatbot has been binded with\nThis chatbot has been binded with multiple tools. This is my tool node.\nmultiple tools. This is my tool node.\nmultiple tools. This is my tool node. Uh when I am creating various tools and\nUh when I am creating various tools and\nUh when I am creating various tools and we we've created one one tools such as\nwe we've created one one tools such as\nwe we've created one one tools such as Tavi, right? we use tavi let's say along\nTavi, right? we use tavi let's say along\nTavi, right? we use tavi let's say along with tavi we will go ahead and create\nwith tavi we will go ahead and create\nwith tavi we will go ahead and create one more custom tool and this is tool is\none more custom tool and this is tool is\none more custom tool and this is tool is related to human assistance\nrelated to human assistance\nrelated to human assistance human assistance that basically means\nhuman assistance that basically means\nhuman assistance that basically means whenever I try to give an input let's\nwhenever I try to give an input let's\nwhenever I try to give an input let's say this is my input\nsay this is my input\nsay this is my input when it goes to this chatbot which is\nwhen it goes to this chatbot which is\nwhen it goes to this chatbot which is binded with lms uh sorry with multiple\nbinded with lms uh sorry with multiple\nbinded with lms uh sorry with multiple tools where we have llm binded with\ntools where we have llm binded with\ntools where we have llm binded with multiple tools so here we have llm with\nmultiple tools so here we have llm with\nmultiple tools so here we have llm with tools\ntools\ntools so based on this input if this makes a\nso based on this input if this makes a\nso based on this input if this makes a specific tool call and in this tool call\nspecific tool call and in this tool call\nspecific tool call and in this tool call instead of making a call to the table if\ninstead of making a call to the table if\ninstead of making a call to the table if it makes a call to the human assistance.\nit makes a call to the human assistance.\nit makes a call to the human assistance. Okay. Now in response the human\nOkay. Now in response the human\nOkay. Now in response the human assistance should provide some kind of\nassistance should provide some kind of\nassistance should provide some kind of feedback\nfeedback\nfeedback some kind of feedback and then the\nsome kind of feedback and then the\nsome kind of feedback and then the chatbot should continue the execution.\nchatbot should continue the execution.\nchatbot should continue the execution. Okay. So this is what we will try to\nOkay. So this is what we will try to\nOkay. So this is what we will try to execute it you know and this feedback\nexecute it you know and this feedback\nexecute it you know and this feedback can be very much necessary you know uh\ncan be very much necessary you know uh\ncan be very much necessary you know uh we can we will take a very good example\nwe can we will take a very good example\nwe can we will take a very good example let's say if there is some complex\nlet's say if there is some complex\nlet's say if there is some complex workflow and in that particular workflow\nworkflow and in that particular workflow\nworkflow and in that particular workflow unless and until a human do not approve\nunless and until a human do not approve\nunless and until a human do not approve that workflow should not be completed\nthat workflow should not be completed\nthat workflow should not be completed right um let's say there are two nodes\nright um let's say there are two nodes\nright um let's say there are two nodes one node is executing here we can\none node is executing here we can\none node is executing here we can interrupt we can interrupt with a human\ninterrupt we can interrupt with a human\ninterrupt we can interrupt with a human feedback if the human gives a good feed\nfeedback if the human gives a good feed\nfeedback if the human gives a good feed feedback saying that yes or continue it\nfeedback saying that yes or continue it\nfeedback saying that yes or continue it should go ahead with the execution.\nshould go ahead with the execution.\nshould go ahead with the execution. Okay. So let's take this example and\nOkay. So let's take this example and\nOkay. So let's take this example and show it to you so that you get a clear\nshow it to you so that you get a clear\nshow it to you so that you get a clear understanding. So first of all I've\nunderstanding. So first of all I've\nunderstanding. So first of all I've created a new file. Okay. So here you\ncreated a new file. Okay. So here you\ncreated a new file. Okay. So here you can see that this is very simple. We are\ncan see that this is very simple. We are\ncan see that this is very simple. We are just loading the model uh which we have\njust loading the model uh which we have\njust loading the model uh which we have already discussed. Here you can see we\nalready discussed. Here you can see we\nalready discussed. Here you can see we are using tavly search tool type deck\nare using tavly search tool type deck\nare using tavly search tool type deck memory saver state graph start add\nmemory saver state graph start add\nmemory saver state graph start add messages is all about your reducers tool\nmessages is all about your reducers tool\nmessages is all about your reducers tool condition tool node. This is the two new\ncondition tool node. This is the two new\ncondition tool node. This is the two new libraries that we are going to\nlibraries that we are going to\nlibraries that we are going to specifically use. Okay, one is command\nspecifically use. Okay, one is command\nspecifically use. Okay, one is command and one is interrupt. Interrupt\nand one is interrupt. Interrupt\nand one is interrupt. Interrupt basically means we are interrupting a\nbasically means we are interrupting a\nbasically means we are interrupting a workflow. It is forcefully interrupting\nworkflow. It is forcefully interrupting\nworkflow. It is forcefully interrupting so that a human can provide a feedback.\nso that a human can provide a feedback.\nso that a human can provide a feedback. Okay. So here is my state. Here I have\nOkay. So here is my state. Here I have\nOkay. So here is my state. Here I have used annotated with list and add\nused annotated with list and add\nused annotated with list and add messages. We have initialized the state\nmessages. We have initialized the state\nmessages. We have initialized the state graph. Here we also imported one tool\ngraph. Here we also imported one tool\ngraph. Here we also imported one tool library. This tool library is useful\nlibrary. This tool library is useful\nlibrary. This tool library is useful because here we will define a function\nbecause here we will define a function\nbecause here we will define a function and that function gets converted to a\nand that function gets converted to a\nand that function gets converted to a tool and this tool can be binded with\ntool and this tool can be binded with\ntool and this tool can be binded with the LLM. So here we are defining a tool\nthe LLM. So here we are defining a tool\nthe LLM. So here we are defining a tool uh which is called as human assistance.\nuh which is called as human assistance.\nuh which is called as human assistance. It takes a string and returns a string.\nIt takes a string and returns a string.\nIt takes a string and returns a string. Here you can see dock string is given\nHere you can see dock string is given\nHere you can see dock string is given request assistance from a human. Human\nrequest assistance from a human. Human\nrequest assistance from a human. Human response interrupt query with this. So\nresponse interrupt query with this. So\nresponse interrupt query with this. So here we are interrupting with query.\nhere we are interrupting with query.\nhere we are interrupting with query. Query is equal to query. So whatever\nQuery is equal to query. So whatever\nQuery is equal to query. So whatever query we pass over here that query it\nquery we pass over here that query it\nquery we pass over here that query it will get interrupted and then we are\nwill get interrupted and then we are\nwill get interrupted and then we are returning human response of data. So\nreturning human response of data. So\nreturning human response of data. So human response of data here we are\nhuman response of data here we are\nhuman response of data here we are returning that information. Then this is\nreturning that information. Then this is\nreturning that information. Then this is my another tool. So we are combining\nmy another tool. So we are combining\nmy another tool. So we are combining those tools in the list. We are binding\nthose tools in the list. We are binding\nthose tools in the list. We are binding them right and here is my entire\nthem right and here is my entire\nthem right and here is my entire chatbot. So this chatbot is nothing but\nchatbot. So this chatbot is nothing but\nchatbot. So this chatbot is nothing but it is llm with tools.invoke and it is\nit is llm with tools.invoke and it is\nit is llm with tools.invoke and it is returning that messages and we are\nreturning that messages and we are\nreturning that messages and we are creating this chatbot. We are adding\ncreating this chatbot. We are adding\ncreating this chatbot. We are adding additional condition along with the tool\nadditional condition along with the tool\nadditional condition along with the tool conditions and all. Right? So if I just\nconditions and all. Right? So if I just\nconditions and all. Right? So if I just go ahead and execute it and here we are\ngo ahead and execute it and here we are\ngo ahead and execute it and here we are applying the memory saver and finally\napplying the memory saver and finally\napplying the memory saver and finally this is the graph it looks like right.\nthis is the graph it looks like right.\nthis is the graph it looks like right. So start chatbot inside the tools there\nSo start chatbot inside the tools there\nSo start chatbot inside the tools there are two tools one is the tavly and one\nare two tools one is the tavly and one\nare two tools one is the tavly and one is the human assistance okay interrupt\nis the human assistance okay interrupt\nis the human assistance okay interrupt one right so interrupt one you can also\none right so interrupt one you can also\none right so interrupt one you can also see over here\nsee over here\nsee over here uh u if you see right this this uh this\nuh u if you see right this this uh this\nuh u if you see right this this uh this interrupt will happen in the tool node\ninterrupt will happen in the tool node\ninterrupt will happen in the tool node right in the tool node because the tools\nright in the tool node because the tools\nright in the tool node because the tools is having that human assistance now\nis having that human assistance now\nis having that human assistance now let's go ahead with the first question\nlet's go ahead with the first question\nlet's go ahead with the first question so first question over here is that user\nso first question over here is that user\nso first question over here is that user input says it is giving an input I need\ninput says it is giving an input I need\ninput says it is giving an input I need some expert guidance for building AI\nsome expert guidance for building AI\nsome expert guidance for building AI agents could you request assistance for\nagents could you request assistance for\nagents could you request assistance for me. Now this assistance will play a very\nme. Now this assistance will play a very\nme. Now this assistance will play a very important role, right? Because here we\nimportant role, right? Because here we\nimportant role, right? Because here we are providing a message and this message\nare providing a message and this message\nare providing a message and this message is matching to this particular dock\nis matching to this particular dock\nis matching to this particular dock string. So when LLM gets that message,\nstring. So when LLM gets that message,\nstring. So when LLM gets that message, it is going to call this specific tool\nit is going to call this specific tool\nit is going to call this specific tool instead of calling Tavly. Okay. So now\ninstead of calling Tavly. Okay. So now\ninstead of calling Tavly. Okay. So now let's go ahead and see here we are\nlet's go ahead and see here we are\nlet's go ahead and see here we are creating a thread ID. We are giving a\ncreating a thread ID. We are giving a\ncreating a thread ID. We are giving a user input which stream mode is equal to\nuser input which stream mode is equal to\nuser input which stream mode is equal to values each and everything and we are\nvalues each and everything and we are\nvalues each and everything and we are executing this. Okay. So here you can\nexecuting this. Okay. So here you can\nexecuting this. Okay. So here you can see a tool call is made. Initially it\nsee a tool call is made. Initially it\nsee a tool call is made. Initially it went to Tavly search. Okay, but it is\nwent to Tavly search. Okay, but it is\nwent to Tavly search. Okay, but it is not able to provide you the answer.\nnot able to provide you the answer.\nnot able to provide you the answer. Tavly search says that expert guidance\nTavly search says that expert guidance\nTavly search says that expert guidance for building AI agent. Now based on the\nfor building AI agent. Now based on the\nfor building AI agent. Now based on the result of the tool, I can see that it\nresult of the tool, I can see that it\nresult of the tool, I can see that it provides two relevant results, a blog\nprovides two relevant results, a blog\nprovides two relevant results, a blog post and a YouTube post. So what it has\npost and a YouTube post. So what it has\npost and a YouTube post. So what it has done is that uh for the first time when\ndone is that uh for the first time when\ndone is that uh for the first time when we call this particular function, it is\nwe call this particular function, it is\nwe call this particular function, it is calling the tably search API. So let's\ncalling the tably search API. So let's\ncalling the tably search API. So let's let's call this again. Okay, I need some\nlet's call this again. Okay, I need some\nlet's call this again. Okay, I need some expert uh guidance and assistance. I\nexpert uh guidance and assistance. I\nexpert uh guidance and assistance. I will change the message now. See what\nwill change the message now. See what\nwill change the message now. See what will happen for building AI agents.\nwill happen for building AI agents.\nwill happen for building AI agents. Could you please uh provide assistance\nCould you please uh provide assistance\nCould you please uh provide assistance to me? Okay. So now we are again\nto me? Okay. So now we are again\nto me? Okay. So now we are again executing. I need some expert guidance\nexecuting. I need some expert guidance\nexecuting. I need some expert guidance and assistance. You can see the tool\nand assistance. You can see the tool\nand assistance. You can see the tool call of human assistance has actually\ncall of human assistance has actually\ncall of human assistance has actually made. So this time when I just change\nmade. So this time when I just change\nmade. So this time when I just change the meth me message over here in the\nthe meth me message over here in the\nthe meth me message over here in the user input, I need some expert guidance\nuser input, I need some expert guidance\nuser input, I need some expert guidance assistance for building AI agent. You\nassistance for building AI agent. You\nassistance for building AI agent. You can see that a tool call is basically\ncan see that a tool call is basically\ncan see that a tool call is basically made. Okay. Now with respect to the\nmade. Okay. Now with respect to the\nmade. Okay. Now with respect to the human because now it has stopped over\nhuman because now it has stopped over\nhuman because now it has stopped over there. Now it is expecting human should\nthere. Now it is expecting human should\nthere. Now it is expecting human should provide some kind of input back right.\nprovide some kind of input back right.\nprovide some kind of input back right. So with respect to this you can see over\nSo with respect to this you can see over\nSo with respect to this you can see over here now human response we have provided\nhere now human response we have provided\nhere now human response we have provided this we the experts are here to help you\nthis we the experts are here to help you\nthis we the experts are here to help you out. We recommend you checking out\nout. We recommend you checking out\nout. We recommend you checking out langraph to build your agent. It's much\nlangraph to build your agent. It's much\nlangraph to build your agent. It's much more reliable and extensible than simple\nmore reliable and extensible than simple\nmore reliable and extensible than simple autonomous agent. So this is the message\nautonomous agent. So this is the message\nautonomous agent. So this is the message the human is basically giving. Now how\nthe human is basically giving. Now how\nthe human is basically giving. Now how do we go ahead and execute this message?\ndo we go ahead and execute this message?\ndo we go ahead and execute this message? We basically use this command. You\nWe basically use this command. You\nWe basically use this command. You remember in the top we we use this\nremember in the top we we use this\nremember in the top we we use this command and we are going to put this\ncommand and we are going to put this\ncommand and we are going to put this rumé is equal to data of human response.\nrumé is equal to data of human response.\nrumé is equal to data of human response. So whatever human response we are\nSo whatever human response we are\nSo whatever human response we are creating we are putting in this\ncreating we are putting in this\ncreating we are putting in this particular value and we are telling\nparticular value and we are telling\nparticular value and we are telling resume the flow of the execution and now\nresume the flow of the execution and now\nresume the flow of the execution and now when we go ahead and resume it here in\nwhen we go ahead and resume it here in\nwhen we go ahead and resume it here in graph.stream we give this particular\ngraph.stream we give this particular\ngraph.stream we give this particular human command and automatically you'll\nhuman command and automatically you'll\nhuman command and automatically you'll be able to see that the execution will\nbe able to see that the execution will\nbe able to see that the execution will happen. Now human we the experts we\nhappen. Now human we the experts we\nhappen. Now human we the experts we getting and then here you got the AI\ngetting and then here you got the AI\ngetting and then here you got the AI message. Thank you for recommendation.\nmessage. Thank you for recommendation.\nmessage. Thank you for recommendation. Langraph seems like a great tool for\nLangraph seems like a great tool for\nLangraph seems like a great tool for building AI agents. I'll make sure to\nbuilding AI agents. I'll make sure to\nbuilding AI agents. I'll make sure to keep that in mind to further assist. I'd\nkeep that in mind to further assist. I'd\nkeep that in mind to further assist. I'd like to ask a follow-up question. What\nlike to ask a follow-up question. What\nlike to ask a follow-up question. What specific these things and all. Now what\nspecific these things and all. Now what\nspecific these things and all. Now what you can do again now it has again\nyou can do again now it has again\nyou can do again now it has again interrupted right uh in sorry it is not\ninterrupted right uh in sorry it is not\ninterrupted right uh in sorry it is not interrupted now it is basically giving\ninterrupted now it is basically giving\ninterrupted now it is basically giving you as an AI message please let me know\nyou as an AI message please let me know\nyou as an AI message please let me know and I'll do my best to provide your\nand I'll do my best to provide your\nand I'll do my best to provide your tailored guidance assistance. Now what\ntailored guidance assistance. Now what\ntailored guidance assistance. Now what you can do is that again you can go\nyou can do is that again you can go\nyou can do is that again you can go ahead and put an interruption and again\nahead and put an interruption and again\nahead and put an interruption and again you can go ahead and provide a response.\nyou can go ahead and provide a response.\nyou can go ahead and provide a response. So when you are probably creating an end\nSo when you are probably creating an end\nSo when you are probably creating an end toend chatbot any number of time you can\ntoend chatbot any number of time you can\ntoend chatbot any number of time you can provide this kind of human feedback in\nprovide this kind of human feedback in\nprovide this kind of human feedback in the low right. So I hope you have\nthe low right. So I hope you have\nthe low right. So I hope you have understood this topic very much clearly.\nunderstood this topic very much clearly.\nunderstood this topic very much clearly. Hello guys. So in this video we are\nHello guys. So in this video we are\nHello guys. So in this video we are going to discuss about how you can build\ngoing to discuss about how you can build\ngoing to discuss about how you can build your own MCP servers. Along with that\nyour own MCP servers. Along with that\nyour own MCP servers. Along with that you'll also be seeing that how you can\nyou'll also be seeing that how you can\nyou'll also be seeing that how you can integrate any kind of MCB servers that\nintegrate any kind of MCB servers that\nintegrate any kind of MCB servers that you build along with your app. So here\nyou build along with your app. So here\nyou build along with your app. So here is one basic diagram. Here you can see\nis one basic diagram. Here you can see\nis one basic diagram. Here you can see there are three main components. One is\nthere are three main components. One is\nthere are three main components. One is MCP servers, MCP client and app.\nMCP servers, MCP client and app.\nMCP servers, MCP client and app. Whenever I talk about MCP servers here\nWhenever I talk about MCP servers here\nWhenever I talk about MCP servers here you can have multiple tools. Just\nyou can have multiple tools. Just\nyou can have multiple tools. Just imagine that there is a other company\nimagine that there is a other company\nimagine that there is a other company third party companies which are\nthird party companies which are\nthird party companies which are developing this kind of services. It can\ndeveloping this kind of services. It can\ndeveloping this kind of services. It can be simple mathematical\nbe simple mathematical\nbe simple mathematical uh you know calculations. It can be\nuh you know calculations. It can be\nuh you know calculations. It can be third party APIs, integrations,\nthird party APIs, integrations,\nthird party APIs, integrations, anything. It can be specifically written\nanything. It can be specifically written\nanything. It can be specifically written over here. uh here uh with respect to\nover here. uh here uh with respect to\nover here. uh here uh with respect to this MCP server it provides you context\nthis MCP server it provides you context\nthis MCP server it provides you context tools and prompts to the client and\ntools and prompts to the client and\ntools and prompts to the client and similarly you have something called as\nsimilarly you have something called as\nsimilarly you have something called as MCP client here the client maintains\nMCP client here the client maintains\nMCP client here the client maintains onetoone connection with the server\nonetoone connection with the server\nonetoone connection with the server inside the host app and finally you also\ninside the host app and finally you also\ninside the host app and finally you also have a app it can be a cloudy desktop or\nhave a app it can be a cloudy desktop or\nhave a app it can be a cloudy desktop or it can be any kind of app that you are\nit can be any kind of app that you are\nit can be any kind of app that you are specifically developing. So uh in this\nspecifically developing. So uh in this\nspecifically developing. So uh in this video what I am actually going to show\nvideo what I am actually going to show\nvideo what I am actually going to show you is that how we can go ahead and\nyou is that how we can go ahead and\nyou is that how we can go ahead and develop this entirely and how we can\ndevelop this entirely and how we can\ndevelop this entirely and how we can also build MCP server from basics or\nalso build MCP server from basics or\nalso build MCP server from basics or from scratch. Okay. So first of all what\nfrom scratch. Okay. So first of all what\nfrom scratch. Okay. So first of all what we are basically going to do is that we\nwe are basically going to do is that we\nwe are basically going to do is that we will be having this uh this application.\nwill be having this uh this application.\nwill be having this uh this application. Let's say that this is the application\nLet's say that this is the application\nLet's say that this is the application that I'm currently building. Okay.\nthat I'm currently building. Okay.\nthat I'm currently building. Okay. Inside this application we are going to\nInside this application we are going to\nInside this application we are going to use lang chain or lang graph. Okay.\nuse lang chain or lang graph. Okay.\nuse lang chain or lang graph. Okay. Application uh we will be having some\nApplication uh we will be having some\nApplication uh we will be having some kind of chatbot application in short.\nkind of chatbot application in short.\nkind of chatbot application in short. Okay. Now this chatbot application may\nOkay. Now this chatbot application may\nOkay. Now this chatbot application may have different different LLM integrated\nhave different different LLM integrated\nhave different different LLM integrated in this. So whenever a user provides any\nin this. So whenever a user provides any\nin this. So whenever a user provides any input okay so let's say a user provides\ninput okay so let's say a user provides\ninput okay so let's say a user provides any input. So based on this particular\nany input. So based on this particular\nany input. So based on this particular input, the LLM should be able to make a\ninput, the LLM should be able to make a\ninput, the LLM should be able to make a decision whether it has to make any kind\ndecision whether it has to make any kind\ndecision whether it has to make any kind of call from an MCP server. Okay. And\nof call from an MCP server. Okay. And\nof call from an MCP server. Okay. And let's say that this MCP server has some\nlet's say that this MCP server has some\nlet's say that this MCP server has some of the important tools. Let's say we\nof the important tools. Let's say we\nof the important tools. Let's say we have tools like addition,\nhave tools like addition,\nhave tools like addition, multiplication. I'm just showing this as\nmultiplication. I'm just showing this as\nmultiplication. I'm just showing this as an example. And let's say that we also\nan example. And let's say that we also\nan example. And let's say that we also go ahead and create one more tool here.\ngo ahead and create one more tool here.\ngo ahead and create one more tool here. um which is just like a weather call\num which is just like a weather call\num which is just like a weather call API. Okay, weather call API.\nAPI. Okay, weather call API.\nAPI. Okay, weather call API. Now here you'll be able to see that this\nNow here you'll be able to see that this\nNow here you'll be able to see that this is my MCP server itself and this MCP\nis my MCP server itself and this MCP\nis my MCP server itself and this MCP server\nserver\nserver is connected to this tools which are\nis connected to this tools which are\nis connected to this tools which are like add multiplication weather call\nlike add multiplication weather call\nlike add multiplication weather call APIs anything as such. So let's say if I\nAPIs anything as such. So let's say if I\nAPIs anything as such. So let's say if I go ahead and ask a question hey what is\ngo ahead and ask a question hey what is\ngo ahead and ask a question hey what is the weather of New York or Bangalore you\nthe weather of New York or Bangalore you\nthe weather of New York or Bangalore you know so the LLM obviously will not be\nknow so the LLM obviously will not be\nknow so the LLM obviously will not be able to answer because obviously LLM do\nable to answer because obviously LLM do\nable to answer because obviously LLM do not have live information so what this\nnot have live information so what this\nnot have live information so what this will do is that it will make a tool call\nwill do is that it will make a tool call\nwill do is that it will make a tool call and this time the tool call will be with\nand this time the tool call will be with\nand this time the tool call will be with the help of MCP protocol\nthe help of MCP protocol\nthe help of MCP protocol here internally there will be a client\nhere internally there will be a client\nhere internally there will be a client that will be developed which is called\nthat will be developed which is called\nthat will be developed which is called as MCP client okay and then once this\nas MCP client okay and then once this\nas MCP client okay and then once this communication is made then that specific\ncommunication is made then that specific\ncommunication is made then that specific uh you know API or tools whichever based\nuh you know API or tools whichever based\nuh you know API or tools whichever based on the input will be called and you\non the input will be called and you\non the input will be called and you finally get a response. Okay. So if I\nfinally get a response. Okay. So if I\nfinally get a response. Okay. So if I talk about like how this entire\ntalk about like how this entire\ntalk about like how this entire communication basically happens uh first\ncommunication basically happens uh first\ncommunication basically happens uh first of all when we get the input right\nof all when we get the input right\nof all when we get the input right direct the call will go to the MCP\ndirect the call will go to the MCP\ndirect the call will go to the MCP server. The MCP server will give you all\nserver. The MCP server will give you all\nserver. The MCP server will give you all the necessary tools along with uh what\nthe necessary tools along with uh what\nthe necessary tools along with uh what all information it has regarding that\nall information it has regarding that\nall information it has regarding that particular tool. Then the LLM will make\nparticular tool. Then the LLM will make\nparticular tool. Then the LLM will make a decision. uh then the LLM takes this\na decision. uh then the LLM takes this\na decision. uh then the LLM takes this particular input and passes it to the\nparticular input and passes it to the\nparticular input and passes it to the MCP server to get the response. So this\nMCP server to get the response. So this\nMCP server to get the response. So this is a basic kind of communication that\nis a basic kind of communication that\nis a basic kind of communication that actually happens and I have already\nactually happens and I have already\nactually happens and I have already covered in depth uh already in my MCP uh\ncovered in depth uh already in my MCP uh\ncovered in depth uh already in my MCP uh module itself right um uh in my previous\nmodule itself right um uh in my previous\nmodule itself right um uh in my previous videos. So this is how the basic\nvideos. So this is how the basic\nvideos. So this is how the basic communication basically happens right\ncommunication basically happens right\ncommunication basically happens right now here what we are going to focus on\nnow here what we are going to focus on\nnow here what we are going to focus on is that I will show you how you can go\nis that I will show you how you can go\nis that I will show you how you can go ahead and create your MCP server from\nahead and create your MCP server from\nahead and create your MCP server from scratch. Okay, here we are going to use\nscratch. Okay, here we are going to use\nscratch. Okay, here we are going to use one of the most popular library which is\none of the most popular library which is\none of the most popular library which is called as langchain and in langchain\ncalled as langchain and in langchain\ncalled as langchain and in langchain there is a library which is called as\nthere is a library which is called as\nthere is a library which is called as langchain adapters. Okay, so that we'll\nlangchain adapters. Okay, so that we'll\nlangchain adapters. Okay, so that we'll be going to use. Second, I will show you\nbe going to use. Second, I will show you\nbe going to use. Second, I will show you how you can go ahead and create your MCP\nhow you can go ahead and create your MCP\nhow you can go ahead and create your MCP client and whenever we talk about MCP\nclient and whenever we talk about MCP\nclient and whenever we talk about MCP protocol or whenever we talk about\nprotocol or whenever we talk about\nprotocol or whenever we talk about communication with the MCP servers,\ncommunication with the MCP servers,\ncommunication with the MCP servers, there are different different transport\nthere are different different transport\nthere are different different transport protocol that we use. Okay, transport\nprotocol that we use. Okay, transport\nprotocol that we use. Okay, transport protocol that we use. Now some of the\nprotocol that we use. Now some of the\nprotocol that we use. Now some of the transport protocol um like um there are\ntransport protocol um like um there are\ntransport protocol um like um there are some kind of arguments which actually\nsome kind of arguments which actually\nsome kind of arguments which actually helps uh you to communicate with any\nhelps uh you to communicate with any\nhelps uh you to communicate with any kind of tools itself. So one of the tool\nkind of tools itself. So one of the tool\nkind of tools itself. So one of the tool that we are going to use is something\nthat we are going to use is something\nthat we are going to use is something called as HTD IO and the other tool that\ncalled as HTD IO and the other tool that\ncalled as HTD IO and the other tool that we are basically going to use is uh\nwe are basically going to use is uh\nwe are basically going to use is uh related to HTTP protocol. Okay. So we'll\nrelated to HTTP protocol. Okay. So we'll\nrelated to HTTP protocol. Okay. So we'll try to understand what are the\ntry to understand what are the\ntry to understand what are the differences between them and uh we'll\ndifferences between them and uh we'll\ndifferences between them and uh we'll try to also use them. Uh again from\ntry to also use them. Uh again from\ntry to also use them. Uh again from coding point of view I'll show you how\ncoding point of view I'll show you how\ncoding point of view I'll show you how this also works. Okay, we will be\nthis also works. Okay, we will be\nthis also works. Okay, we will be developing our MCP server. We'll also be\ndeveloping our MCP server. We'll also be\ndeveloping our MCP server. We'll also be developing our MCP client in this MCP\ndeveloping our MCP client in this MCP\ndeveloping our MCP client in this MCP server. Uh when I talk with respect to\nserver. Uh when I talk with respect to\nserver. Uh when I talk with respect to the tools this tool, one of the tool we\nthe tools this tool, one of the tool we\nthe tools this tool, one of the tool we will try to run it with the help of\nwill try to run it with the help of\nwill try to run it with the help of transport protocol that is HTDIO and the\ntransport protocol that is HTDIO and the\ntransport protocol that is HTDIO and the other one we will try to use HTTP. Okay.\nother one we will try to use HTTP. Okay.\nother one we will try to use HTTP. Okay. And we'll also talk about the\nAnd we'll also talk about the\nAnd we'll also talk about the differences what exactly this both this\ndifferences what exactly this both this\ndifferences what exactly this both this transport mechanism uh how does it vi\ntransport mechanism uh how does it vi\ntransport mechanism uh how does it vi you know. So um now let me quickly go\nyou know. So um now let me quickly go\nyou know. So um now let me quickly go ahead and let me open and this we are\nahead and let me open and this we are\nahead and let me open and this we are going to completely start from scratch.\ngoing to completely start from scratch.\ngoing to completely start from scratch. So first of all I am inside my drive.\nSo first of all I am inside my drive.\nSo first of all I am inside my drive. Okay. So this is the MCP demo lang chin.\nOkay. So this is the MCP demo lang chin.\nOkay. So this is the MCP demo lang chin. So here you can see uh I will open my\nSo here you can see uh I will open my\nSo here you can see uh I will open my cursor ID. I hope everybody has the\ncursor ID. I hope everybody has the\ncursor ID. I hope everybody has the cursor ID now. Okay. Now from this\ncursor ID now. Okay. Now from this\ncursor ID now. Okay. Now from this cursor ID what I am actually going to do\ncursor ID what I am actually going to do\ncursor ID what I am actually going to do is that I'm going to go ahead and open\nis that I'm going to go ahead and open\nis that I'm going to go ahead and open this particular folder location as my\nthis particular folder location as my\nthis particular folder location as my project. Okay. So here I will go ahead\nproject. Okay. So here I will go ahead\nproject. Okay. So here I will go ahead and give this particular path and I will\nand give this particular path and I will\nand give this particular path and I will select the folder. Okay. Now the first\nselect the folder. Okay. Now the first\nselect the folder. Okay. Now the first step uh when you are specifically using\nstep uh when you are specifically using\nstep uh when you are specifically using cursor or whenever you work in any kind\ncursor or whenever you work in any kind\ncursor or whenever you work in any kind of projects it is good that you try to\nof projects it is good that you try to\nof projects it is good that you try to uh create a environment. Right now\nuh create a environment. Right now\nuh create a environment. Right now before creating an environment uh I need\nbefore creating an environment uh I need\nbefore creating an environment uh I need to initialize this particular workspace\nto initialize this particular workspace\nto initialize this particular workspace as a UV u uh with the help of the UV\nas a UV u uh with the help of the UV\nas a UV u uh with the help of the UV package. Okay. So if you know about UV\npackage. Okay. So if you know about UV\npackage. Okay. So if you know about UV uh it is quite faster. uh you'll be able\nuh it is quite faster. uh you'll be able\nuh it is quite faster. uh you'll be able to probably do the development very very\nto probably do the development very very\nto probably do the development very very much fast with respect to the package\nmuch fast with respect to the package\nmuch fast with respect to the package management of the entire project itself\nmanagement of the entire project itself\nmanagement of the entire project itself right uh any Python project so uh let's\nright uh any Python project so uh let's\nright uh any Python project so uh let's say that I'm going to go ahead and\nsay that I'm going to go ahead and\nsay that I'm going to go ahead and initialize this workspace with the help\ninitialize this workspace with the help\ninitialize this workspace with the help of UV package so I'll write uv in it so\nof UV package so I'll write uv in it so\nof UV package so I'll write uv in it so this is the first step now here you can\nthis is the first step now here you can\nthis is the first step now here you can see based on this there are some files\nsee based on this there are some files\nsee based on this there are some files that has been already created okay and\nthat has been already created okay and\nthat has been already created okay and uh if I talk with respect to all the\nuh if I talk with respect to all the\nuh if I talk with respect to all the specific files that we have created uh\nspecific files that we have created uh\nspecific files that we have created uh over here one very important thing is\nover here one very important thing is\nover here one very important thing is that U you have to go ahead and see\nthat U you have to go ahead and see\nthat U you have to go ahead and see which Python version this entire u you\nwhich Python version this entire u you\nwhich Python version this entire u you know the basic package is basically\nknow the basic package is basically\nknow the basic package is basically created with. So here you can see Python\ncreated with. So here you can see Python\ncreated with. So here you can see Python version is 3.13 here you have this pi\nversion is 3.13 here you have this pi\nversion is 3.13 here you have this pi project.2ml. So right now the dependency\nproject.2ml. So right now the dependency\nproject.2ml. So right now the dependency is empty because we have not installed\nis empty because we have not installed\nis empty because we have not installed any kind of dependencies right now right\nany kind of dependencies right now right\nany kind of dependencies right now right but we will go ahead and install it\nbut we will go ahead and install it\nbut we will go ahead and install it right and this is the basic project\nright and this is the basic project\nright and this is the basic project information now to start with any\ninformation now to start with any\ninformation now to start with any project I will go ahead and create my\nproject I will go ahead and create my\nproject I will go ahead and create my virtual environment. In order to create\nvirtual environment. In order to create\nvirtual environment. In order to create the virtual environment with the help of\nthe virtual environment with the help of\nthe virtual environment with the help of UV, it is very simple. So I'll go ahead\nUV, it is very simple. So I'll go ahead\nUV, it is very simple. So I'll go ahead and write uv VNV. Okay. Now here it\nand write uv VNV. Okay. Now here it\nand write uv VNV. Okay. Now here it shows that okay my VNV environment has\nshows that okay my VNV environment has\nshows that okay my VNV environment has got created. Now any packages that I\ngot created. Now any packages that I\ngot created. Now any packages that I install I have to install inside this.\ninstall I have to install inside this.\ninstall I have to install inside this. So first of all I will go ahead and\nSo first of all I will go ahead and\nSo first of all I will go ahead and activate my environment. In order to\nactivate my environment. In order to\nactivate my environment. In order to activate I will just go ahead and copy\nactivate I will just go ahead and copy\nactivate I will just go ahead and copy this command and paste it over here.\nthis command and paste it over here.\nthis command and paste it over here. Okay. So now we have activated my\nOkay. So now we have activated my\nOkay. So now we have activated my environment itself. Okay. Now this is\nenvironment itself. Okay. Now this is\nenvironment itself. Okay. Now this is done. Now the next step is that we go\ndone. Now the next step is that we go\ndone. Now the next step is that we go ahead and install some of the packages.\nahead and install some of the packages.\nahead and install some of the packages. Okay. Now we will see how to install the\nOkay. Now we will see how to install the\nOkay. Now we will see how to install the packages. But before that I will just go\npackages. But before that I will just go\npackages. But before that I will just go ahead and create my requirement.txt.\nahead and create my requirement.txt.\nahead and create my requirement.txt. requirement.txt.\nrequirement.txt.\nrequirement.txt. Okay. Now with respect to\nOkay. Now with respect to\nOkay. Now with respect to requirement.txt uh I will just go ahead\nrequirement.txt uh I will just go ahead\nrequirement.txt uh I will just go ahead and write what all libraries I will be\nand write what all libraries I will be\nand write what all libraries I will be requiring. Okay. So two libraries that I\nrequiring. Okay. So two libraries that I\nrequiring. Okay. So two libraries that I specifically want to use. one is\nspecifically want to use. one is\nspecifically want to use. one is langchain grock and then you also have\nlangchain grock and then you also have\nlangchain grock and then you also have something like lang chain adapters right\nsomething like lang chain adapters right\nsomething like lang chain adapters right so as I said uh we going to go ahead and\nso as I said uh we going to go ahead and\nso as I said uh we going to go ahead and use um some of the libraries that are\nuse um some of the libraries that are\nuse um some of the libraries that are available with respect to this that is\navailable with respect to this that is\navailable with respect to this that is langchen adapters and with the help of\nlangchen adapters and with the help of\nlangchen adapters and with the help of langin adapters you will definitely be\nlangin adapters you will definitely be\nlangin adapters you will definitely be able to use this MCP properties even in\nable to use this MCP properties even in\nable to use this MCP properties even in langchen okay so here you can see I'll\nlangchen okay so here you can see I'll\nlangchen okay so here you can see I'll write lang mcp adapters sorry it is mcp\nwrite lang mcp adapters sorry it is mcp\nwrite lang mcp adapters sorry it is mcp adapters along Along with this uh I'm\nadapters along Along with this uh I'm\nadapters along Along with this uh I'm also going to use one library which is\nalso going to use one library which is\nalso going to use one library which is called as fast MCP.\ncalled as fast MCP.\ncalled as fast MCP. Fast MCP. Okay. So here with respect to\nFast MCP. Okay. So here with respect to\nFast MCP. Okay. So here with respect to fast MCP you can actually see this what\nfast MCP you can actually see this what\nfast MCP you can actually see this what exactly this is. Okay. So let me just go\nexactly this is. Okay. So let me just go\nexactly this is. Okay. So let me just go ahead and search for fast MCP again. So\nahead and search for fast MCP again. So\nahead and search for fast MCP again. So if I talk about fast MCP here you can\nif I talk about fast MCP here you can\nif I talk about fast MCP here you can see it is the fast Pythonic. It is\nsee it is the fast Pythonic. It is\nsee it is the fast Pythonic. It is written something like Pythonic way to\nwritten something like Pythonic way to\nwritten something like Pythonic way to build MCP server and client. Okay. So we\nbuild MCP server and client. Okay. So we\nbuild MCP server and client. Okay. So we going to specifically use this. This is\ngoing to specifically use this. This is\ngoing to specifically use this. This is a very very easy way of creating MCP\na very very easy way of creating MCP\na very very easy way of creating MCP tools and all. So definitely I will show\ntools and all. So definitely I will show\ntools and all. So definitely I will show you step by step how you can basically\nyou step by step how you can basically\nyou step by step how you can basically use this fast MCP library and develop\nuse this fast MCP library and develop\nuse this fast MCP library and develop your entire MCP servers from scratch.\nyour entire MCP servers from scratch.\nyour entire MCP servers from scratch. Okay. Step by step we will go ahead and\nOkay. Step by step we will go ahead and\nOkay. Step by step we will go ahead and implement it. Now quickly uh here we are\nimplement it. Now quickly uh here we are\nimplement it. Now quickly uh here we are going to create three more important\ngoing to create three more important\ngoing to create three more important files. Okay. Now what all files needs to\nfiles. Okay. Now what all files needs to\nfiles. Okay. Now what all files needs to be created based on this uh that is what\nbe created based on this uh that is what\nbe created based on this uh that is what I'm going to discuss and understand\nI'm going to discuss and understand\nI'm going to discuss and understand based on the use cases right uh I have\nbased on the use cases right uh I have\nbased on the use cases right uh I have to I've already told you that I'm going\nto I've already told you that I'm going\nto I've already told you that I'm going to use one MCP server which has this add\nto use one MCP server which has this add\nto use one MCP server which has this add multiplication and we'll use the\nmultiplication and we'll use the\nmultiplication and we'll use the transport as studio and we'll create\ntransport as studio and we'll create\ntransport as studio and we'll create another MCP server which will be\nanother MCP server which will be\nanother MCP server which will be communicating to this tool that is\ncommunicating to this tool that is\ncommunicating to this tool that is called as weather call API and it will\ncalled as weather call API and it will\ncalled as weather call API and it will use this HTTP tool right uh transport\nuse this HTTP tool right uh transport\nuse this HTTP tool right uh transport mechanism okay transport mechanical\nmechanism okay transport mechanical\nmechanism okay transport mechanical mechanism basically means the\nmechanism basically means the\nmechanism basically means the communication between the client and the\ncommunication between the client and the\ncommunication between the client and the MCP server how it is basically going to\nMCP server how it is basically going to\nMCP server how it is basically going to happen. Okay. And uh so what we are\nhappen. Okay. And uh so what we are\nhappen. Okay. And uh so what we are basically going to do is that over here\nbasically going to do is that over here\nbasically going to do is that over here I will just go ahead and uh write all my\nI will just go ahead and uh write all my\nI will just go ahead and uh write all my packages that is specifically required.\npackages that is specifically required.\npackages that is specifically required. Okay. And uh along with this I will also\nOkay. And uh along with this I will also\nOkay. And uh along with this I will also go ahead and import MCP. Okay. So this\ngo ahead and import MCP. Okay. So this\ngo ahead and import MCP. Okay. So this MCP will actually help us to use the\nMCP will actually help us to use the\nMCP will actually help us to use the package fast MCP itself. Okay. Now here\npackage fast MCP itself. Okay. Now here\npackage fast MCP itself. Okay. Now here is my requirement.txt. The next step is\nis my requirement.txt. The next step is\nis my requirement.txt. The next step is that how do I go ahead and install all\nthat how do I go ahead and install all\nthat how do I go ahead and install all these particular libraries. It is very\nthese particular libraries. It is very\nthese particular libraries. It is very simple. I will go ahead and write uv add\nsimple. I will go ahead and write uv add\nsimple. I will go ahead and write uv add minus r requirement.txt like how we used\nminus r requirement.txt like how we used\nminus r requirement.txt like how we used to write pip install requirement.txt.\nto write pip install requirement.txt.\nto write pip install requirement.txt. Similarly we'll go ahead and do this.\nSimilarly we'll go ahead and do this.\nSimilarly we'll go ahead and do this. Okay. So now I'm going to go ahead and\nOkay. So now I'm going to go ahead and\nOkay. So now I'm going to go ahead and clear the screen and just to confirm\nclear the screen and just to confirm\nclear the screen and just to confirm whether all the installation has\nwhether all the installation has\nwhether all the installation has happened or not. So here you can\nhappened or not. So here you can\nhappened or not. So here you can basically go ahead and check out all the\nbasically go ahead and check out all the\nbasically go ahead and check out all the installation with respect to this. Okay.\ninstallation with respect to this. Okay.\ninstallation with respect to this. Okay. Uh till here everything looks good. uh\nUh till here everything looks good. uh\nUh till here everything looks good. uh our installation has happened perfectly\nour installation has happened perfectly\nour installation has happened perfectly and uh we have already uh you know\nand uh we have already uh you know\nand uh we have already uh you know installed all the packages that is\ninstalled all the packages that is\ninstalled all the packages that is required. Okay. Now uh let me just go\nrequired. Okay. Now uh let me just go\nrequired. Okay. Now uh let me just go ahead and create some important tools\nahead and create some important tools\nahead and create some important tools right with respect to the MCP server. So\nright with respect to the MCP server. So\nright with respect to the MCP server. So first tool that I'm actually going to\nfirst tool that I'm actually going to\nfirst tool that I'm actually going to create it's nothing but math server.\ncreate it's nothing but math server.\ncreate it's nothing but math server. Okay. So math server. py. So this is\nOkay. So math server. py. So this is\nOkay. So math server. py. So this is just like my MCP server. And here we are\njust like my MCP server. And here we are\njust like my MCP server. And here we are going to define some of the tools that\ngoing to define some of the tools that\ngoing to define some of the tools that we are basically going to use. Okay. So\nwe are basically going to use. Okay. So\nwe are basically going to use. Okay. So quickly in order to use this as I said\nquickly in order to use this as I said\nquickly in order to use this as I said I'm going to use fast MCP. So I'll write\nI'm going to use fast MCP. So I'll write\nI'm going to use fast MCP. So I'll write from MCP dots server dot fast MCP. I'm\nfrom MCP dots server dot fast MCP. I'm\nfrom MCP dots server dot fast MCP. I'm going to go ahead and import fast MCP.\ngoing to go ahead and import fast MCP.\ngoing to go ahead and import fast MCP. Okay. And once we do this uh the next\nOkay. And once we do this uh the next\nOkay. And once we do this uh the next step is that we need to initialize this\nstep is that we need to initialize this\nstep is that we need to initialize this MCP right. So I'll go ahead and write\nMCP right. So I'll go ahead and write\nMCP right. So I'll go ahead and write MCP is equal to fast MCP and I will give\nMCP is equal to fast MCP and I will give\nMCP is equal to fast MCP and I will give my tool name which is nothing but math.\nmy tool name which is nothing but math.\nmy tool name which is nothing but math. Okay. So I'll give my tool name which is\nOkay. So I'll give my tool name which is\nOkay. So I'll give my tool name which is nothing but math. Okay. Now uh inside\nnothing but math. Okay. Now uh inside\nnothing but math. Okay. Now uh inside this tool uh sorry inside the server uh\nthis tool uh sorry inside the server uh\nthis tool uh sorry inside the server uh this is just a server name okay not tool\nthis is just a server name okay not tool\nthis is just a server name okay not tool name uh because math is just a basic\nname uh because math is just a basic\nname uh because math is just a basic server name over here. Then the next\nserver name over here. Then the next\nserver name over here. Then the next step is that I will just go ahead and\nstep is that I will just go ahead and\nstep is that I will just go ahead and write add the rate MCP.\nwrite add the rate MCP.\nwrite add the rate MCP. And this is how we go ahead and create\nAnd this is how we go ahead and create\nAnd this is how we go ahead and create our first tool which is present inside\nour first tool which is present inside\nour first tool which is present inside this MCP server. So I'll create a\nthis MCP server. So I'll create a\nthis MCP server. So I'll create a definition. I'll write add. I'm just\ndefinition. I'll write add. I'm just\ndefinition. I'll write add. I'm just starting with a basic example so that\nstarting with a basic example so that\nstarting with a basic example so that see the limit as we say right? you want\nsee the limit as we say right? you want\nsee the limit as we say right? you want to go ahead and write create any kind of\nto go ahead and write create any kind of\nto go ahead and write create any kind of tool but it is un important that you\ntool but it is un important that you\ntool but it is un important that you understand from basic stuffs right so\nunderstand from basic stuffs right so\nunderstand from basic stuffs right so then my second parameter will be is\nthen my second parameter will be is\nthen my second parameter will be is equal to int and this I'm going to give\nequal to int and this I'm going to give\nequal to int and this I'm going to give return it in the form of integer here uh\nreturn it in the form of integer here uh\nreturn it in the form of integer here uh I'm going to probably provide some dock\nI'm going to probably provide some dock\nI'm going to probably provide some dock string and based on this dock string the\nstring and based on this dock string the\nstring and based on this dock string the llm will be able to understand which\nllm will be able to understand which\nllm will be able to understand which tool to specifically call so here I will\ntool to specifically call so here I will\ntool to specifically call so here I will write add two numbers\nwrite add two numbers\nwrite add two numbers okay and then we're going to go ahead\nokay and then we're going to go ahead\nokay and then we're going to go ahead and return\nand return\nand return a + b. Okay. Then the next tool is\na + b. Okay. Then the next tool is\na + b. Okay. Then the next tool is nothing but mcp. tool. And here we going\nnothing but mcp. tool. And here we going\nnothing but mcp. tool. And here we going to go ahead and define multiply\nto go ahead and define multiply\nto go ahead and define multiply a colon\na colon\na colon int, comm, b col, int. Again, you can go\nint, comm, b col, int. Again, you can go\nint, comm, b col, int. Again, you can go ahead and define any number of tools as\nahead and define any number of tools as\nahead and define any number of tools as you want. So this will return a int\nyou want. So this will return a int\nyou want. So this will return a int type. And here I'll just go ahead and\ntype. And here I'll just go ahead and\ntype. And here I'll just go ahead and write multiply\nwrite multiply\nwrite multiply multiply\nmultiply\nmultiply two numbers. Okay.\ntwo numbers. Okay.\ntwo numbers. Okay. some information that I'm specifically\nsome information that I'm specifically\nsome information that I'm specifically giving and I'll go and write return a\ngiving and I'll go and write return a\ngiving and I'll go and write return a return a multiplied by b. Okay. Now the\nreturn a multiplied by b. Okay. Now the\nreturn a multiplied by b. Okay. Now the thing is that see I am planning to\nthing is that see I am planning to\nthing is that see I am planning to create this mcp server with respect to\ncreate this mcp server with respect to\ncreate this mcp server with respect to this addition multiplication or any kind\nthis addition multiplication or any kind\nthis addition multiplication or any kind of tool on the transport hddio. Now we\nof tool on the transport hddio. Now we\nof tool on the transport hddio. Now we need to understand what this htdiod\nneed to understand what this htdiod\nneed to understand what this htdiod transport basically means. Okay. And uh\ntransport basically means. Okay. And uh\ntransport basically means. Okay. And uh what you will be able to do from it uh\nwhat you will be able to do from it uh\nwhat you will be able to do from it uh and it is important that we get a clear\nand it is important that we get a clear\nand it is important that we get a clear understanding about that because uh many\nunderstanding about that because uh many\nunderstanding about that because uh many people have seen that they try to write\npeople have seen that they try to write\npeople have seen that they try to write this particular code but they fail to\nthis particular code but they fail to\nthis particular code but they fail to explain this. Okay. Um what does mcp.tr\nexplain this. Okay. Um what does mcp.tr\nexplain this. Okay. Um what does mcp.tr run you know so let's say that I want to\nrun you know so let's say that I want to\nrun you know so let's say that I want to run this particular file. How do I go\nrun this particular file. How do I go\nrun this particular file. How do I go ahead and run this? First of all I'll go\nahead and run this? First of all I'll go\nahead and run this? First of all I'll go ahead and write the code. So quickly I\nahead and write the code. So quickly I\nahead and write the code. So quickly I will write mcp.run. So here what I'm\nwill write mcp.run. So here what I'm\nwill write mcp.run. So here what I'm actually going to do I'll just say if_\nactually going to do I'll just say if_\nactually going to do I'll just say if_ name double equal to\nname double equal to\nname double equal to main\nmain\nmain and here I will just go ahead and write\nand here I will just go ahead and write\nand here I will just go ahead and write mcp.trun\nmcp.trun\nmcp.trun and we're going to run this entire\nand we're going to run this entire\nand we're going to run this entire application of mcp using the transport\napplication of mcp using the transport\napplication of mcp using the transport transport double equal to stddio IO.\ntransport double equal to stddio IO.\ntransport double equal to stddio IO. Okay. Now here we have used a transport\nOkay. Now here we have used a transport\nOkay. Now here we have used a transport called as H std IO. Now we need to\ncalled as H std IO. Now we need to\ncalled as H std IO. Now we need to understand what this transport is and\nunderstand what this transport is and\nunderstand what this transport is and for this I will just go ahead and put\nfor this I will just go ahead and put\nfor this I will just go ahead and put some basic information so that you\nsome basic information so that you\nsome basic information so that you should be able to read it within the\nshould be able to read it within the\nshould be able to read it within the material itself. Okay. So here I will\nmaterial itself. Okay. So here I will\nmaterial itself. Okay. So here I will write two important comments.\nwrite two important comments.\nwrite two important comments. The transport is equal to H stdio.\nThe transport is equal to H stdio.\nThe transport is equal to H stdio. And here one more sentence. Okay, it\nAnd here one more sentence. Okay, it\nAnd here one more sentence. Okay, it tells the server to use standard input\ntells the server to use standard input\ntells the server to use standard input output to receive and respond to the\noutput to receive and respond to the\noutput to receive and respond to the tool functional calls. Now see what this\ntool functional calls. Now see what this\ntool functional calls. Now see what this is right when we say input output right\nis right when we say input output right\nis right when we say input output right the standard input output. Now standard\nthe standard input output. Now standard\nthe standard input output. Now standard input output is like let's say if this\ninput output is like let's say if this\ninput output is like let's say if this is a server if it is running this will\nis a server if it is running this will\nis a server if it is running this will specifically run in some kind of command\nspecifically run in some kind of command\nspecifically run in some kind of command prompt. Let's say in in in in one of the\nprompt. Let's say in in in in one of the\nprompt. Let's say in in in in one of the scenario what we can do is that if I\nscenario what we can do is that if I\nscenario what we can do is that if I have a client and I want that client to\nhave a client and I want that client to\nhave a client and I want that client to interact with this particular server\ninteract with this particular server\ninteract with this particular server then what we'll do if we have written\nthen what we'll do if we have written\nthen what we'll do if we have written this transport is equal to stdio we will\nthis transport is equal to stdio we will\nthis transport is equal to stdio we will run this particular file directly in the\nrun this particular file directly in the\nrun this particular file directly in the command prompt and get the input and\ncommand prompt and get the input and\ncommand prompt and get the input and output there itself like let's say if I\noutput there itself like let's say if I\noutput there itself like let's say if I want to probably get give an input that\nwant to probably get give an input that\nwant to probably get give an input that input should go with respect to the\ninput should go with respect to the\ninput should go with respect to the command line itself hit any function and\ncommand line itself hit any function and\ncommand line itself hit any function and get the response out there and the\nget the response out there and the\nget the response out there and the client should be able to read the\nclient should be able to read the\nclient should be able to read the information out directly from the uh HDI\ninformation out directly from the uh HDI\ninformation out directly from the uh HDI out that basically means from the\nout that basically means from the\nout that basically means from the command prompt itself. Right? So this\ncommand prompt itself. Right? So this\ncommand prompt itself. Right? So this kind of thing is very helpful if you\nkind of thing is very helpful if you\nkind of thing is very helpful if you really want to test out things locally.\nreally want to test out things locally.\nreally want to test out things locally. You have uh your server executed in the\nYou have uh your server executed in the\nYou have uh your server executed in the locally itself and you really want to go\nlocally itself and you really want to go\nlocally itself and you really want to go ahead and test it with the client.\nahead and test it with the client.\nahead and test it with the client. Right? So at that point of time you can\nRight? So at that point of time you can\nRight? So at that point of time you can use HTDIO. Okay. So this is the basic\nuse HTDIO. Okay. So this is the basic\nuse HTDIO. Okay. So this is the basic functionality with respect to this. So\nfunctionality with respect to this. So\nfunctionality with respect to this. So this is one of the server that we have\nthis is one of the server that we have\nthis is one of the server that we have basically created. The another server\nbasically created. The another server\nbasically created. The another server that I am really interested in creating\nthat I am really interested in creating\nthat I am really interested in creating is about uh let's say there may be a\nis about uh let's say there may be a\nis about uh let's say there may be a third party API call you know that API\nthird party API call you know that API\nthird party API call you know that API call can be with respect to weather it\ncall can be with respect to weather it\ncall can be with respect to weather it can be anything as such but just to show\ncan be anything as such but just to show\ncan be anything as such but just to show it to you I will quickly go ahead and\nit to you I will quickly go ahead and\nit to you I will quickly go ahead and create one weather py file okay now\ncreate one weather py file okay now\ncreate one weather py file okay now weatherp file see now at the end of the\nweatherp file see now at the end of the\nweatherp file see now at the end of the day I'll also talk about like how do you\nday I'll also talk about like how do you\nday I'll also talk about like how do you probably take it to the production and\nprobably take it to the production and\nprobably take it to the production and what exactly goes into the production\nwhat exactly goes into the production\nwhat exactly goes into the production also So I'll not show you directly by\nalso So I'll not show you directly by\nalso So I'll not show you directly by executing this in the cloud but I'll\nexecuting this in the cloud but I'll\nexecuting this in the cloud but I'll give you a brief idea how things works\ngive you a brief idea how things works\ngive you a brief idea how things works over here. Right? So here I will go\nover here. Right? So here I will go\nover here. Right? So here I will go ahead and write from MCP.Server\nahead and write from MCP.Server\nahead and write from MCP.Server dotfast MCP import\ndotfast MCP import\ndotfast MCP import fast MCP. Okay. And then I'm going to go\nfast MCP. Okay. And then I'm going to go\nfast MCP. Okay. And then I'm going to go ahead and write MCP is equal to fast\nahead and write MCP is equal to fast\nahead and write MCP is equal to fast MCP. And this time this particular\nMCP. And this time this particular\nMCP. And this time this particular server name will be my weather. Okay.\nserver name will be my weather. Okay.\nserver name will be my weather. Okay. Now here I'm going to go ahead and\nNow here I'm going to go ahead and\nNow here I'm going to go ahead and create my MCP tool. Okay. Now\ncreate my MCP tool. Okay. Now\ncreate my MCP tool. Okay. Now in a real world scenario if I talk about\nin a real world scenario if I talk about\nin a real world scenario if I talk about that this is my MCP server and I want to\nthat this is my MCP server and I want to\nthat this is my MCP server and I want to probably take an input and give the\nprobably take an input and give the\nprobably take an input and give the weather of a specific location. That is\nweather of a specific location. That is\nweather of a specific location. That is the code that I'm going to write it over\nthe code that I'm going to write it over\nthe code that I'm going to write it over here. Okay. But for right now I'll just\nhere. Okay. But for right now I'll just\nhere. Okay. But for right now I'll just going and defining something. So I'll go\ngoing and defining something. So I'll go\ngoing and defining something. So I'll go ahead and write hey this is my get\nahead and write hey this is my get\nahead and write hey this is my get weather functionality and let's say this\nweather functionality and let's say this\nweather functionality and let's say this is my location. Okay this is my\nis my location. Okay this is my\nis my location. Okay this is my location. This is my str and this will\nlocation. This is my str and this will\nlocation. This is my str and this will basically return a str.\nbasically return a str.\nbasically return a str. Okay. And then what I will do, I will go\nOkay. And then what I will do, I will go\nOkay. And then what I will do, I will go ahead and write my dock string. Get the\nahead and write my dock string. Get the\nahead and write my dock string. Get the get the\nget the\nget the get\nget\nget the weather location. Okay, weather\nthe weather location. Okay, weather\nthe weather location. Okay, weather location.

See\nI'm going to use another transport. See\nI'm going to use another transport. See whenever I want something see the before\nwhenever I want something see the before\nwhenever I want something see the before the one one transport mechanism that we\nthe one one transport mechanism that we\nthe one one transport mechanism that we have specifically used is nothing but\nhave specifically used is nothing but\nhave specifically used is nothing but HDIO right HDIO I've told you the\nHDIO right HDIO I've told you the\nHDIO right HDIO I've told you the importance of it in this we are going to\nimportance of it in this we are going to\nimportance of it in this we are going to use streamable\nuse streamable\nuse streamable HTTP right HTTP now you need to\nHTTP right HTTP now you need to\nHTTP right HTTP now you need to understand what this exactly means okay\nunderstand what this exactly means okay\nunderstand what this exactly means okay so guys now let's understand what this\nso guys now let's understand what this\nso guys now let's understand what this transport streamable HTTP will do okay\ntransport streamable HTTP will do okay\ntransport streamable HTTP will do okay now here uh in order to make you\nnow here uh in order to make you\nnow here uh in order to make you understand what exactly the function\nunderstand what exactly the function\nunderstand what exactly the function that is right. So I'll just go ahead and\nthat is right. So I'll just go ahead and\nthat is right. So I'll just go ahead and open my terminal. Now inside my\nopen my terminal. Now inside my\nopen my terminal. Now inside my terminal, what I will do? I will just go\nterminal, what I will do? I will just go\nterminal, what I will do? I will just go ahead and run this. See python weather.\nahead and run this. See python weather.\nahead and run this. See python weather. py. Let's run this. Okay. Now here you\npy. Let's run this. Okay. Now here you\npy. Let's run this. Okay. Now here you can see that this entire application,\ncan see that this entire application,\ncan see that this entire application, this entire server is running in this\nthis entire server is running in this\nthis entire server is running in this particular URL. Okay. When we use\nparticular URL. Okay. When we use\nparticular URL. Okay. When we use streamable HTTP transport, what it is\nstreamable HTTP transport, what it is\nstreamable HTTP transport, what it is going to do is that it is going to run\ngoing to do is that it is going to run\ngoing to do is that it is going to run as an API service itself. Okay.\nas an API service itself. Okay.\nas an API service itself. Okay. Similarly, if I go ahead and run this\nSimilarly, if I go ahead and run this\nSimilarly, if I go ahead and run this math server right in HDDIO, it will not\nmath server right in HDDIO, it will not\nmath server right in HDDIO, it will not run like that. See here, it will not run\nrun like that. See here, it will not run\nrun like that. See here, it will not run like that. Instead, it will try to get\nlike that. Instead, it will try to get\nlike that. Instead, it will try to get it'll it it will not run in any kind of\nit'll it it will not run in any kind of\nit'll it it will not run in any kind of HTTP protocol, but instead it uses\nHTTP protocol, but instead it uses\nHTTP protocol, but instead it uses standard input and output. Okay. So, if\nstandard input and output. Okay. So, if\nstandard input and output. Okay. So, if I just go ahead and execute this Python\nI just go ahead and execute this Python\nI just go ahead and execute this Python math server. py here, you can see that\nmath server. py here, you can see that\nmath server. py here, you can see that nothing is happening, right? So, that\nnothing is happening, right? So, that\nnothing is happening, right? So, that basically means internally as in the\nbasically means internally as in the\nbasically means internally as in the command prompt it is getting executed.\ncommand prompt it is getting executed.\ncommand prompt it is getting executed. Okay? But if I see in this particular\nOkay? But if I see in this particular\nOkay? But if I see in this particular use case when we are using weather. py\nuse case when we are using weather. py\nuse case when we are using weather. py with the help of transport is equal to\nwith the help of transport is equal to\nwith the help of transport is equal to streamable http. Here you can see that\nstreamable http. Here you can see that\nstreamable http. Here you can see that it is working it is running as in the\nit is working it is running as in the\nit is working it is running as in the form of an API with this particular URL.\nform of an API with this particular URL.\nform of an API with this particular URL. So here after this transport you can\nSo here after this transport you can\nSo here after this transport you can also go ahead and set up your URL and\nalso go ahead and set up your URL and\nalso go ahead and set up your URL and all. And with respect to that you can\nall. And with respect to that you can\nall. And with respect to that you can also set up the port. Okay. But right\nalso set up the port. Okay. But right\nalso set up the port. Okay. But right now we are not running this. We are\nnow we are not running this. We are\nnow we are not running this. We are running this as an HTTP. Right. So by\nrunning this as an HTTP. Right. So by\nrunning this as an HTTP. Right. So by default you'll be able to see it is\ndefault you'll be able to see it is\ndefault you'll be able to see it is taking my local host and the default\ntaking my local host and the default\ntaking my local host and the default port is 8,000. Now the question rises\nport is 8,000. Now the question rises\nport is 8,000. Now the question rises Chris fine you you told me the\nChris fine you you told me the\nChris fine you you told me the differences between streamable HTTP and\ndifferences between streamable HTTP and\ndifferences between streamable HTTP and obviously HTD uh uh where my transport\nobviously HTD uh uh where my transport\nobviously HTD uh uh where my transport was HTT out right so here I have used\nwas HTT out right so here I have used\nwas HTT out right so here I have used HTIO right so you you have told the\nHTIO right so you you have told the\nHTIO right so you you have told the differences between this but how do we\ndifferences between this but how do we\ndifferences between this but how do we go ahead and integrate it from the\ngo ahead and integrate it from the\ngo ahead and integrate it from the client so here what I will do I'll go\nclient so here what I will do I'll go\nclient so here what I will do I'll go ahead and write client py so see I have\nahead and write client py so see I have\nahead and write client py so see I have created two servers one is the math\ncreated two servers one is the math\ncreated two servers one is the math server and one is the weather server now\nserver and one is the weather server now\nserver and one is the weather server now it's time that we go ahead and go go\nit's time that we go ahead and go go\nit's time that we go ahead and go go ahead and write our client py file so\nahead and write our client py file so\nahead and write our client py file so let this things get running. Now I'm\nlet this things get running. Now I'm\nlet this things get running. Now I'm going to go ahead and focus on\ngoing to go ahead and focus on\ngoing to go ahead and focus on understanding that how do you go ahead\nunderstanding that how do you go ahead\nunderstanding that how do you go ahead and write the client py. At the end of\nand write the client py. At the end of\nand write the client py. At the end of the day this client py should be able to\nthe day this client py should be able to\nthe day this client py should be able to interact with maths server py and\ninteract with maths server py and\ninteract with maths server py and weather. py. So for this I'll be using\nweather. py. So for this I'll be using\nweather. py. So for this I'll be using from langchin_mcp\nfrom langchin_mcp\nfrom langchin_mcp adapters doclient. So we have to first\nadapters doclient. So we have to first\nadapters doclient. So we have to first of all go ahead and create a client and\nof all go ahead and create a client and\nof all go ahead and create a client and this client should be according to the\nthis client should be according to the\nthis client should be according to the documentation that is given from the\ndocumentation that is given from the\ndocumentation that is given from the langraph it should be a multi-server MCP\nlangraph it should be a multi-server MCP\nlangraph it should be a multi-server MCP client. Okay, that basically means\nclient. Okay, that basically means\nclient. Okay, that basically means supports multiserver itself. Then in\nsupports multiserver itself. Then in\nsupports multiserver itself. Then in lang graph\nlang graph\nlang graph whenever I want to probably call any of\nwhenever I want to probably call any of\nwhenever I want to probably call any of this particular client, we need to\nthis particular client, we need to\nthis particular client, we need to create an agent. That agent will be\ncreate an agent. That agent will be\ncreate an agent. That agent will be responsible in integrating all these\nresponsible in integrating all these\nresponsible in integrating all these particular models, llm models or tools.\nparticular models, llm models or tools.\nparticular models, llm models or tools. Tools basically means all these MCP\nTools basically means all these MCP\nTools basically means all these MCP tools and all right. So for this we will\ntools and all right. So for this we will\ntools and all right. So for this we will be using pre-built. So from lang graph\nbe using pre-built. So from lang graph\nbe using pre-built. So from lang graph dot pre-built. So first of all I will\ndot pre-built. So first of all I will\ndot pre-built. So first of all I will just go ahead and quickly add\njust go ahead and quickly add\njust go ahead and quickly add lang graph also because I require lang\nlang graph also because I require lang\nlang graph also because I require lang graph. Okay. So here I'll open my\ngraph. Okay. So here I'll open my\ngraph. Okay. So here I'll open my command prompt another command prompt\ncommand prompt another command prompt\ncommand prompt another command prompt and I'll write hey uv add minus r\nand I'll write hey uv add minus r\nand I'll write hey uv add minus r requirement.txt.\nOkay. So this is perfect. And then\nOkay. So this is perfect. And then you'll be able to see that if I just go\nyou'll be able to see that if I just go\nyou'll be able to see that if I just go back to my client. py now I will be able\nback to my client. py now I will be able\nback to my client. py now I will be able to import it. So from langu dot\nto import it. So from langu dot\nto import it. So from langu dot pre-built create react agent. So for\npre-built create react agent. So for\npre-built create react agent. So for creating an agent uh so that based on\ncreating an agent uh so that based on\ncreating an agent uh so that based on the input the agent the LLM will be able\nthe input the agent the LLM will be able\nthe input the agent the LLM will be able to act an agent itself. And uh you know\nto act an agent itself. And uh you know\nto act an agent itself. And uh you know in my previous videos I have all\nin my previous videos I have all\nin my previous videos I have all discussed about this uh if you're\ndiscussed about this uh if you're\ndiscussed about this uh if you're following the series of videos that we\nfollowing the series of videos that we\nfollowing the series of videos that we have developed right then from langchain\nhave developed right then from langchain\nhave developed right then from langchain grock import chat. So I'm going to go\ngrock import chat. So I'm going to go\ngrock import chat. So I'm going to go ahead and use chat gro also. And then\nahead and use chat gro also. And then\nahead and use chat gro also. And then from langchain\nopen aai openai we will not going to\nopen aai openai we will not going to use. So from langchain\nuse. So from langchain\nuse. So from langchain core I'm also going to go ahead and use\ncore I'm also going to go ahead and use\ncore I'm also going to go ahead and use or let's say for right now I will just\nor let's say for right now I will just\nor let's say for right now I will just go ahead and use like this from env\ngo ahead and use like this from env\ngo ahead and use like this from env import load_.env and then I'll go ahead\nimport load_.env and then I'll go ahead\nimport load_.env and then I'll go ahead and initialize this load_.env env and\nand initialize this load_.env env and\nand initialize this load_.env env and then I will also import a sync io right\nthen I will also import a sync io right\nthen I will also import a sync io right now the next thing is that I definitely\nnow the next thing is that I definitely\nnow the next thing is that I definitely require my env file so quickly let me go\nrequire my env file so quickly let me go\nrequire my env file so quickly let me go ahead and create myv file this is just\nahead and create myv file this is just\nahead and create myv file this is just for my llm model right so I'll write gro\nfor my llm model right so I'll write gro\nfor my llm model right so I'll write gro api key since I'm going to use grock API\napi key since I'm going to use grock API\napi key since I'm going to use grock API key now I hope everybody if you're\nkey now I hope everybody if you're\nkey now I hope everybody if you're following all the tutorials that I have\nfollowing all the tutorials that I have\nfollowing all the tutorials that I have created till now you should know how to\ncreated till now you should know how to\ncreated till now you should know how to create a gro API key right so here is my\ncreate a gro API key right so here is my\ncreate a gro API key right so here is my gro API key I'll go back to my client\ngro API key I'll go back to my client\ngro API key I'll go back to my client and inside this particular client I'll\nand inside this particular client I'll\nand inside this particular client I'll start uh going and writing my content\nstart uh going and writing my content\nstart uh going and writing my content right uh my code sorry now what I'm\nright uh my code sorry now what I'm\nright uh my code sorry now what I'm going to do I'll go ahead and write a\ngoing to do I'll go ahead and write a\ngoing to do I'll go ahead and write a sync definition main okay and here we\nsync definition main okay and here we\nsync definition main okay and here we are basically going to go ahead and\nare basically going to go ahead and\nare basically going to go ahead and create our client this client that we\ncreate our client this client that we\ncreate our client this client that we are going to create will be my\nare going to create will be my\nare going to create will be my multi-server HTTP client sorry MCP\nmulti-server HTTP client sorry MCP\nmulti-server HTTP client sorry MCP client and here I will give the client\nclient and here I will give the client\nclient and here I will give the client key value pairs right so the first\nkey value pairs right so the first\nkey value pairs right so the first client that I want to create so first\nclient that I want to create so first\nclient that I want to create so first server that I want to create right so\nserver that I want to create right so\nserver that I want to create right so this client will be able to interact act\nthis client will be able to interact act\nthis client will be able to interact act with this MCP server. So it will be my\nwith this MCP server. So it will be my\nwith this MCP server. So it will be my math server. In the math server, let's\nmath server. In the math server, let's\nmath server. In the math server, let's say the command that I want to use in\nsay the command that I want to use in\nsay the command that I want to use in order to execute my math server will be\norder to execute my math server will be\norder to execute my math server will be nothing but Python because you can use\nnothing but Python because you can use\nnothing but Python because you can use Python or UV. It is up to you. Okay,\nPython or UV. It is up to you. Okay,\nPython or UV. It is up to you. Okay, Python. And then the next parameter that\nPython. And then the next parameter that\nPython. And then the next parameter that we give is argument. Okay, let's see\nwe give is argument. Okay, let's see\nwe give is argument. Okay, let's see some\nsome\nsome there are a lot of suggestion that comes\nthere are a lot of suggestion that comes\nthere are a lot of suggestion that comes in this right. So arguments. So inside\nin this right. So arguments. So inside\nin this right. So arguments. So inside the arguments\nthe arguments\nthe arguments I will give my another parameter and\nI will give my another parameter and\nI will give my another parameter and that parameter will be nothing but it\nthat parameter will be nothing but it\nthat parameter will be nothing but it will be my file name.

Okay, dot content will give the\ncontent. Okay, dot content will give the\ncontent. Okay, dot content will give the output of the maths response. Okay, now\noutput of the maths response. Okay, now\noutput of the maths response. Okay, now since this main function is a sync so in\nsince this main function is a sync so in\nsince this main function is a sync so in order to run this we are basically going\norder to run this we are basically going\norder to run this we are basically going to use a sync io rain. Okay. And here we\nto use a sync io rain. Okay. And here we\nto use a sync io rain. Okay. And here we are going to call the main function.\nare going to call the main function.\nare going to call the main function. Okay. So whenever we use async io uh\nOkay. So whenever we use async io uh\nOkay. So whenever we use async io uh whenever we define any method that is\nwhenever we define any method that is\nwhenever we define any method that is async, we have to go ahead and run this\nasync, we have to go ahead and run this\nasync, we have to go ahead and run this with this particular uh library which we\nwith this particular uh library which we\nwith this particular uh library which we have imported it over here. Okay. So\nhave imported it over here. Okay. So\nhave imported it over here. Okay. So here we are just trying to get the math\nhere we are just trying to get the math\nhere we are just trying to get the math response. Okay. Now let's go ahead and\nresponse. Okay. Now let's go ahead and\nresponse. Okay. Now let's go ahead and execute this. I will go ahead and open\nexecute this. I will go ahead and open\nexecute this. I will go ahead and open my command prompt. Now understand very\nmy command prompt. Now understand very\nmy command prompt. Now understand very important thing. When I'm calling this\nimportant thing. When I'm calling this\nimportant thing. When I'm calling this agent, right, it is invoking which tool?\nagent, right, it is invoking which tool?\nagent, right, it is invoking which tool? Based on this particular message, it\nBased on this particular message, it\nBased on this particular message, it will invoke this tool. And you know in\nwill invoke this tool. And you know in\nwill invoke this tool. And you know in this tool the transport is H stdiodio\nthis tool the transport is H stdiodio\nthis tool the transport is H stdiodio that basically means this tool is going\nthat basically means this tool is going\nthat basically means this tool is going to run in the normal standard IO device\nto run in the normal standard IO device\nto run in the normal standard IO device standard input output device that is\nstandard input output device that is\nstandard input output device that is nothing but command line. So that the\nnothing but command line. So that the\nnothing but command line. So that the input will directly go over there and\ninput will directly go over there and\ninput will directly go over there and get the output from there. Okay. So here\nget the output from there. Okay. So here\nget the output from there. Okay. So here in order to execute this if I go ahead\nin order to execute this if I go ahead\nin order to execute this if I go ahead and write python client.py okay now you\nand write python client.py okay now you\nand write python client.py okay now you should be able to see I'll cancel this.\nshould be able to see I'll cancel this.\nshould be able to see I'll cancel this. You should be able to see what will be\nYou should be able to see what will be\nYou should be able to see what will be the output for this. What's 3 + 5 * 12.\nthe output for this. What's 3 + 5 * 12.\nthe output for this. What's 3 + 5 * 12. Okay. So this is my input. Now you\nOkay. So this is my input. Now you\nOkay. So this is my input. Now you should be able to see what will be the\nshould be able to see what will be the\nshould be able to see what will be the house. Here's a step-by-step breakdown.\nhouse. Here's a step-by-step breakdown.\nhouse. Here's a step-by-step breakdown. Addition 3 + 5 is equal to 8\nAddition 3 + 5 is equal to 8\nAddition 3 + 5 is equal to 8 multiplication 8 * 2 is equal to 19.\nmultiplication 8 * 2 is equal to 19.\nmultiplication 8 * 2 is equal to 19. Math response is nothing but the result\nMath response is nothing but the result\nMath response is nothing but the result of 3 + 5 * 2 is 96. So 8 * 12 it is\nof 3 + 5 * 2 is 96. So 8 * 12 it is\nof 3 + 5 * 2 is 96. So 8 * 12 it is nothing but 96. This is absolutely\nnothing but 96. This is absolutely\nnothing but 96. This is absolutely perfectly fine. Okay. So here you can\nperfectly fine. Okay. So here you can\nperfectly fine. Okay. So here you can quickly see that how we are able to call\nquickly see that how we are able to call\nquickly see that how we are able to call our MCP uh server and that is nothing\nour MCP uh server and that is nothing\nour MCP uh server and that is nothing but our math server which is running in\nbut our math server which is running in\nbut our math server which is running in this HTDO right now the other thing is\nthis HTDO right now the other thing is\nthis HTDO right now the other thing is that if I also want to check the weather\nthat if I also want to check the weather\nthat if I also want to check the weather weather server right so for the weather\nweather server right so for the weather\nweather server right so for the weather server again I will go ahead and write\nserver again I will go ahead and write\nserver again I will go ahead and write like something like this see I'll give a\nlike something like this see I'll give a\nlike something like this see I'll give a question quickly and it will be the same\nquestion quickly and it will be the same\nquestion quickly and it will be the same thing see weather response await\nthing see weather response await\nthing see weather response await agent.invoke invoke content what is the\nagent.invoke invoke content what is the\nagent.invoke invoke content what is the weather in NYC or California right\nweather in NYC or California right\nweather in NYC or California right California now this it'll take this\nCalifornia now this it'll take this\nCalifornia now this it'll take this particular message but right now I have\nparticular message but right now I have\nparticular message but right now I have hardcoded the output it it always rain\nhardcoded the output it it always rain\nhardcoded the output it it always rain it always uh rains in it is always\nit always uh rains in it is always\nit always uh rains in it is always raining in California right we have\nraining in California right we have\nraining in California right we have written like this so my weather response\nwritten like this so my weather response\nwritten like this so my weather response should probably come the same thing what\nshould probably come the same thing what\nshould probably come the same thing what we are getting directly from the weather\nwe are getting directly from the weather\nwe are getting directly from the weather py okay so I will go ahead and run this\npy okay so I will go ahead and run this\npy okay so I will go ahead and run this once Okay. And before running this, I\nonce Okay. And before running this, I\nonce Okay. And before running this, I will also go ahead and print the output.\nwill also go ahead and print the output.\nwill also go ahead and print the output. Okay. So this is my weather response.\nOkay. So this is my weather response.\nOkay. So this is my weather response. Yeah, it is printed. So now if I just go\nYeah, it is printed. So now if I just go\nYeah, it is printed. So now if I just go ahead and execute this again,\nahead and execute this again,\nahead and execute this again, pythonclient.py. First of all, I should\npythonclient.py. First of all, I should\npythonclient.py. First of all, I should be getting my math response. And the\nbe getting my math response. And the\nbe getting my math response. And the second thing is that I should be getting\nsecond thing is that I should be getting\nsecond thing is that I should be getting my weather response. Okay. So quickly\nmy weather response. Okay. So quickly\nmy weather response. Okay. So quickly let's see this. And this is how you are\nlet's see this. And this is how you are\nlet's see this. And this is how you are basically communicating from one client\nbasically communicating from one client\nbasically communicating from one client to multiple servers itself. Right? So it\nto multiple servers itself. Right? So it\nto multiple servers itself. Right? So it is taking some amount of time. Okay. See\nis taking some amount of time. Okay. See\nis taking some amount of time. Okay. See at sometimes you know sometimes this\nat sometimes you know sometimes this\nat sometimes you know sometimes this kind of errors will come. You just need\nkind of errors will come. You just need\nkind of errors will come. You just need to go ahead and restart it. Okay. But\nto go ahead and restart it. Okay. But\nto go ahead and restart it. Okay. But now it'll not it will not uh this kind\nnow it'll not it will not uh this kind\nnow it'll not it will not uh this kind of error will not come. Okay. So now\nof error will not come. Okay. So now\nof error will not come. Okay. So now you'll be able to see that\nyou'll be able to see that\nyou'll be able to see that uh it'll do the execution. So here you\nuh it'll do the execution. So here you\nuh it'll do the execution. So here you can see the result of 3 + 5 weather\ncan see the result of 3 + 5 weather\ncan see the result of 3 + 5 weather response. The tool indicated it is\nresponse. The tool indicated it is\nresponse. The tool indicated it is always raining in California but in\nalways raining in California but in\nalways raining in California but in reality California has a diverse\nreality California has a diverse\nreality California has a diverse climate. So LLM is also able to add some\nclimate. So LLM is also able to add some\nclimate. So LLM is also able to add some information which is good. But here now\ninformation which is good. But here now\ninformation which is good. But here now the tool is basically returning this.\nthe tool is basically returning this.\nthe tool is basically returning this. Okay. So that is the reason uh again it\nOkay. So that is the reason uh again it\nOkay. So that is the reason uh again it depends on what kind of API\ndepends on what kind of API\ndepends on what kind of API functionality you're implementing it.\nfunctionality you're implementing it.\nfunctionality you're implementing it. The best part is that this is running in\nThe best part is that this is running in\nThe best part is that this is running in a streamable HTTP. So like it's running\na streamable HTTP. So like it's running\na streamable HTTP. So like it's running in the form of a in in some URL. You can\nin the form of a in in some URL. You can\nin the form of a in in some URL. You can just see that and we integrating that in\njust see that and we integrating that in\njust see that and we integrating that in client.py right and this is the URL that\nclient.py right and this is the URL that\nclient.py right and this is the URL that we getting it with /mcb right and all\nwe getting it with /mcb right and all\nwe getting it with /mcb right and all these things with the help of langchen\nthese things with the help of langchen\nthese things with the help of langchen adapter. Right? So I hope uh you are\nadapter. Right? So I hope uh you are\nadapter. Right? So I hope uh you are able to understand this particular\nable to understand this particular\nable to understand this particular example. Uh now what you can do is that\nexample. Uh now what you can do is that\nexample. Uh now what you can do is that you can close all the thing all the all\nyou can close all the thing all the all\nyou can close all the thing all the all the all the servers where what you're\nthe all the servers where what you're\nthe all the servers where what you're running but these are some some servers\nrunning but these are some some servers\nrunning but these are some some servers that are independently running and\nthat are independently running and\nthat are independently running and you're integrating them in a single\nyou're integrating them in a single\nyou're integrating them in a single client. Okay. So these were two ways of\nclient. Okay. So these were two ways of\nclient. Okay. So these were two ways of calling one is HDIO transport and\ncalling one is HDIO transport and\ncalling one is HDIO transport and streamable HTTP transport. So here we\nstreamable HTTP transport. So here we\nstreamable HTTP transport. So here we have created a client. So in short what\nhave created a client. So in short what\nhave created a client. So in short what all things we did? So we created a\nall things we did? So we created a\nall things we did? So we created a client and this client were able to\nclient and this client were able to\nclient and this client were able to communicate with two MCP servers. Okay.\ncommunicate with two MCP servers. Okay.\ncommunicate with two MCP servers. Okay. So this communication was basically\nSo this communication was basically\nSo this communication was basically happening this MCP server.\nhappening this MCP server.\nhappening this MCP server. This MCP server it is basically\nThis MCP server it is basically\nThis MCP server it is basically communicating with your transport equal\ncommunicating with your transport equal\ncommunicating with your transport equal to HTD IO and this MCP server you are\nto HTD IO and this MCP server you are\nto HTD IO and this MCP server you are able to communicate with HTTP protocol\nable to communicate with HTTP protocol\nable to communicate with HTTP protocol transport protocol and here see this\ntransport protocol and here see this\ntransport protocol and here see this entire thing is basically set up with\nentire thing is basically set up with\nentire thing is basically set up with MCP protocol itself. So we had that MCP\nMCP protocol itself. So we had that MCP\nMCP protocol itself. So we had that MCP server client right in this you had some\nserver client right in this you had some\nserver client right in this you had some tools like math addition subtraction\ntools like math addition subtraction\ntools like math addition subtraction whatever tool you want to create and\nwhatever tool you want to create and\nwhatever tool you want to create and this was like an weather API right\nthis was like an weather API right\nthis was like an weather API right the main thing is that when you're\nthe main thing is that when you're\nthe main thing is that when you're running this tool you are basically\nrunning this tool you are basically\nrunning this tool you are basically communicating with respect to the\ncommunicating with respect to the\ncommunicating with respect to the response from the HTD IO itself that\nresponse from the HTD IO itself that\nresponse from the HTD IO itself that basically means from the command prompt\nbasically means from the command prompt\nbasically means from the command prompt here we were using some kind of URL\nhere we were using some kind of URL\nhere we were using some kind of URL right so that is the reason we use HTTP\nright so that is the reason we use HTTP\nright so that is the reason we use HTTP so I hope uh you understood this\nso I hope uh you understood this\nso I hope uh you understood this particular video.

Now let's get\nto create these projects. Now let's get started with Langraph. I created this\nstarted with Langraph. I created this\nstarted with Langraph. I created this video on building LLM based apps using\nvideo on building LLM based apps using\nvideo on building LLM based apps using lang. And I told you that lang is\nlang.

Lang stands for the large language models because we're\nthe large language models because we're\nthe large language models because we're building LLM based apps. And chain\nbuilding LLM based apps. And chain\nbuilding LLM based apps. And chain stands for what? Chain represents what?\nstands for what? Chain represents what?\nstands for what? Chain represents what? Chain is nothing but we are talking\nChain is nothing but we are talking\nChain is nothing but we are talking about a chain of any executables any\nabout a chain of any executables any\nabout a chain of any executables any runnables any task or function that we\nrunnables any task or function that we\nrunnables any task or function that we are performing in very simple terms. But\nare performing in very simple terms. But\nare performing in very simple terms. But the point here to note is that we are\nthe point here to note is that we are\nthe point here to note is that we are talking about chain. We are talking\ntalking about chain. We are talking\ntalking about chain. We are talking about linear workflows that do this then\nabout linear workflows that do this then\nabout linear workflows that do this then do this then do this then do this. So\ndo this then do this then do this. So\ndo this then do this then do this. So it's a linear workflow of any\nit's a linear workflow of any\nit's a linear workflow of any executables or any task that we are\nexecutables or any task that we are\nexecutables or any task that we are performing. But in reality, in real\nperforming. But in reality, in real\nperforming. But in reality, in real cases, you can think of them. There are\ncases, you can think of them. There are\ncases, you can think of them. There are so many and we are going to take real\nso many and we are going to take real\nso many and we are going to take real examples. We're going to build so many\nexamples. We're going to build so many\nexamples. We're going to build so many apps. In reality, what is going to\napps. In reality, what is going to\napps. In reality, what is going to happen is that the workflows that we are\nhappen is that the workflows that we are\nhappen is that the workflows that we are going to have is often going to be\ngoing to have is often going to be\ngoing to have is often going to be nonlinear. Right? So, how do we deal\nnonlinear. Right? So, how do we deal\nnonlinear. Right? So, how do we deal with these nonlinear workflows?\nwith these nonlinear workflows?\nwith these nonlinear workflows? Introducing Langraph. Langraph is part\nIntroducing Langraph. Langraph is part\nIntroducing Langraph. Langraph is part of Langchain ecosystem. It uses as the\nof Langchain ecosystem.

So we'll be able to build very very\nSo we'll be able to build very very\nSo we'll be able to build very very complex workflows in very easy way. But\ncomplex workflows in very easy way. But\ncomplex workflows in very easy way. But does that mean that you need to know\ndoes that mean that you need to know\ndoes that mean that you need to know lang chain before knowing langraph\nlang chain before knowing langraph\nlang chain before knowing langraph because it is like an extension of lang\nbecause it is like an extension of lang\nbecause it is like an extension of lang chain right? Not necessarily. You should\nchain right? Not necessarily. You should\nchain right? Not necessarily. You should still be able to follow this video. But\nstill be able to follow this video. But\nstill be able to follow this video. But I highly recommend that after watching\nI highly recommend that after watching\nI highly recommend that after watching this do watch the lang also because\nthis do watch the lang also because\nthis do watch the lang also because first some of your concepts will get\nfirst some of your concepts will get\nfirst some of your concepts will get like the basic concepts will get clearer\nlike the basic concepts will get clearer\nlike the basic concepts will get clearer like chat models and all of that. So I\nlike chat models and all of that. So I\nlike chat models and all of that. So I will not be repeating that in a lot of\nwill not be repeating that in a lot of\nwill not be repeating that in a lot of detail. So after watching this make sure\ndetail. So after watching this make sure\ndetail. So after watching this make sure that you watch lang video as well.\nthat you watch lang video as well.\nthat you watch lang video as well. Before we move ahead I would like to\nBefore we move ahead I would like to\nBefore we move ahead I would like to take a moment over here to say something\ntake a moment over here to say something\ntake a moment over here to say something to those who are technically interested\nto those who are technically interested\nto those who are technically interested in geni. See there are two sides of\nin geni. See there are two sides of\nin geni. See there are two sides of geni. One is if you are learning to\ngeni. One is if you are learning to\ngeni. One is if you are learning to build your own lms build your own\nbuild your own lms build your own\nbuild your own lms build your own version of ch. The other side is when\nversion of ch. The other side is when\nversion of ch. The other side is when you are learning to use LLMs to build\nyou are learning to use LLMs to build\nyou are learning to use LLMs to build your own apps. Now if you're learning to\nyour own apps. Now if you're learning to\nyour own apps. Now if you're learning to build your own LLMs, you need to\nbuild your own LLMs, you need to\nbuild your own LLMs, you need to understand transformer architecture\nunderstand transformer architecture\nunderstand transformer architecture based on which chat GPT is built. And\nbased on which chat GPT is built. And\nbased on which chat GPT is built. And for that the prerequisite is\nfor that the prerequisite is\nfor that the prerequisite is understanding LSTM and RNN for which the\nunderstanding LSTM and RNN for which the\nunderstanding LSTM and RNN for which the prerequisite is neural network. So this\nprerequisite is neural network. So this\nprerequisite is neural network. So this is how you will be able to build your\nis how you will be able to build your\nis how you will be able to build your own version of chat GPT neural networks\nown version of chat GPT neural networks\nown version of chat GPT neural networks ANN CNN RNN LSTM transformer\nANN CNN RNN LSTM transformer\nANN CNN RNN LSTM transformer architecture and then you will be ready\narchitecture and then you will be ready\narchitecture and then you will be ready to build. And when you're talking about\nto build. And when you're talking about\nto build. And when you're talking about building your own apps, that is where\nbuilding your own apps, that is where\nbuilding your own apps, that is where lang chain rag and all of this comes\nlang chain rag and all of this comes\nlang chain rag and all of this comes into picture.

If you're interested in learning live with me or\ninterested in learning live with me or\ninterested in learning live with me or watch the recordings seven weeks, this\nwatch the recordings seven weeks, this\nwatch the recordings seven weeks, this is very very comprehensive and we are\nis very very comprehensive and we are\nis very very comprehensive and we are covering everything. It's very beginner\ncovering everything. It's very beginner\ncovering everything. It's very beginner friendly. At least check out the details\nfriendly. At least check out the details\nfriendly. At least check out the details in the description. For now, let's get\nin the description. For now, let's get\nin the description. For now, let's get back to the video. We will be\nback to the video. We will be\nback to the video. We will be understanding Lang graph using this\nunderstanding Lang graph using this\nunderstanding Lang graph using this particular example. This will be the\nparticular example. This will be the\nparticular example. This will be the goal of our video. And you can see this\ngoal of our video. And you can see this\ngoal of our video. And you can see this looks like a typical graph. So there are\nlooks like a typical graph. So there are\nlooks like a typical graph. So there are many nodes. There are going to be edges.\nmany nodes. There are going to be edges.\nmany nodes. There are going to be edges. So you can see these are different\nSo you can see these are different\nSo you can see these are different edges. You can see there is one start\nedges. You can see there is one start\nedges. You can see there is one start node. You can see there is one end node\nnode. You can see there is one end node\nnode. You can see there is one end node and there are some other nodes with some\nand there are some other nodes with some\nand there are some other nodes with some names. So what exactly is happening?\nnames. So what exactly is happening?\nnames. So what exactly is happening? What example have we picked up? Let's\nWhat example have we picked up? Let's\nWhat example have we picked up? Let's first discuss that. So here what I'm\nfirst discuss that. So here what I'm\nfirst discuss that. So here what I'm doing is I'm building an app where we\ndoing is I'm building an app where we\ndoing is I'm building an app where we are going to get applications for a\nare going to get applications for a\nare going to get applications for a particular job role. So for example, our\nparticular job role. So for example, our\nparticular job role. So for example, our job role is say for Python role and we\njob role is say for Python role and we\njob role is say for Python role and we are going to get a lot of applications.\nare going to get a lot of applications.\nare going to get a lot of applications. So we are building an app to see that\nSo we are building an app to see that\nSo we are building an app to see that what should be done with these\nwhat should be done with these\nwhat should be done with these applications. What is the next step to\napplications. What is the next step to\napplications. What is the next step to be done for any particular candidate? So\nbe done for any particular candidate? So\nbe done for any particular candidate? So once we have an application the first\nonce we have an application the first\nonce we have an application the first thing that we're going to do over here\nthing that we're going to do over here\nthing that we're going to do over here is to make one call to LLM. Now the\nis to make one call to LLM. Now the\nis to make one call to LLM. Now the entire benefit of using lang chain lang\nentire benefit of using lang chain lang\nentire benefit of using lang chain lang graph is that you can be making the call\ngraph is that you can be making the call\ngraph is that you can be making the call to literally any lm even at different\nto literally any lm even at different\nto literally any lm even at different points. Suppose over here I am making\npoints. Suppose over here I am making\npoints. Suppose over here I am making one call to GPT and over here I'm making\none call to GPT and over here I'm making\none call to GPT and over here I'm making another call to DC. That is also\nanother call to DC. That is also\nanother call to DC. That is also possible right? So it is very very easy\npossible right? So it is very very easy\npossible right? So it is very very easy to use literally there's like one line\nto use literally there's like one line\nto use literally there's like one line change and it is very simple. Right? So\nchange and it is very simple. Right? So\nchange and it is very simple. Right? So let's assume that we are making the call\nlet's assume that we are making the call\nlet's assume that we are making the call to open AAI GPT. That is what we'll be\nto open AAI GPT. That is what we'll be\nto open AAI GPT. That is what we'll be doing over here. We'll be making the\ndoing over here. We'll be making the\ndoing over here. We'll be making the calls to the same GPT um LLM over here.\ncalls to the same GPT um LLM over here.\ncalls to the same GPT um LLM over here. So here what I'm making the call for is\nSo here what I'm making the call for is\nSo here what I'm making the call for is that whatever is the application that I\nthat whatever is the application that I\nthat whatever is the application that I got I'm just going to send that to our\ngot I'm just going to send that to our\ngot I'm just going to send that to our LLM which is our GPT in this case and\nLLM which is our GPT in this case and\nLLM which is our GPT in this case and we're going to say categorize this\nwe're going to say categorize this\nwe're going to say categorize this particular experience into one of the\nparticular experience into one of the\nparticular experience into one of the levels. Now the levels can be entry\nlevels. Now the levels can be entry\nlevels. Now the levels can be entry level, mid-level or senior level\nlevel, mid-level or senior level\nlevel, mid-level or senior level experience. Basically application will\nexperience. Basically application will\nexperience. Basically application will have like huge text or suppose it is\nhave like huge text or suppose it is\nhave like huge text or suppose it is generated from rum or anything right. So\ngenerated from rum or anything right. So\ngenerated from rum or anything right. So now from that text our LLM is going to\nnow from that text our LLM is going to\nnow from that text our LLM is going to analyze it and it is going to categorize\nanalyze it and it is going to categorize\nanalyze it and it is going to categorize the application into one of the three\nthe application into one of the three\nthe application into one of the three levels. So the candidate can be entry\nlevels. So the candidate can be entry\nlevels. So the candidate can be entry level, mid-level or senior level. So\nlevel, mid-level or senior level. So\nlevel, mid-level or senior level. So this task is going to be performed by\nthis task is going to be performed by\nthis task is going to be performed by LLM. Right? So every node you see is\nLLM. Right? So every node you see is\nLLM. Right? So every node you see is going to have a name. Every node has a\ngoing to have a name. Every node has a\ngoing to have a name. Every node has a name and a function associated with it.\nname and a function associated with it.\nname and a function associated with it. So in this categorize experience\nSo in this categorize experience\nSo in this categorize experience function we are going to make the call\nfunction we are going to make the call\nfunction we are going to make the call and we are going to get the response\nand we are going to get the response\nand we are going to get the response from there that okay this is one of the\nfrom there that okay this is one of the\nfrom there that okay this is one of the three levels to which our particular\nthree levels to which our particular\nthree levels to which our particular candidate belongs and once we have\ncandidate belongs and once we have\ncandidate belongs and once we have categorized the experience of our\ncategorized the experience of our\ncategorized the experience of our candidate the next thing that we are\ncandidate the next thing that we are\ncandidate the next thing that we are going to do is assess the skills. See we\ngoing to do is assess the skills. See we\ngoing to do is assess the skills. See we are hiring for a particular role like\nare hiring for a particular role like\nare hiring for a particular role like for example we are hiring for a python\nfor example we are hiring for a python\nfor example we are hiring for a python role. Now in this particular application\nrole. Now in this particular application\nrole. Now in this particular application we will have something written in the\nwe will have something written in the\nwe will have something written in the application right suppose from there our\napplication right suppose from there our\napplication right suppose from there our LLM is going to assess the application\nLLM is going to assess the application\nLLM is going to assess the application is going to understand that this\nis going to understand that this\nis going to understand that this particular candidate is a skilled in\nparticular candidate is a skilled in\nparticular candidate is a skilled in what domain like for example Java or\nwhat domain like for example Java or\nwhat domain like for example Java or Python or C++ or whatever and it is\nPython or C++ or whatever and it is\nPython or C++ or whatever and it is going to assess the skill. So we are\ngoing to assess the skill. So we are\ngoing to assess the skill. So we are going to tell LLM that this is my job\ngoing to tell LLM that this is my job\ngoing to tell LLM that this is my job description or this is the role for\ndescription or this is the role for\ndescription or this is the role for which I am hiring and this is the\nwhich I am hiring and this is the\nwhich I am hiring and this is the application. Now you assess it and you\napplication. Now you assess it and you\napplication. Now you assess it and you tell me whether it is a match or not.\ntell me whether it is a match or not.\ntell me whether it is a match or not. Understood? So we are not doing the\nUnderstood? So we are not doing the\nUnderstood? So we are not doing the assessment. Our LLM will do it for us.\nassessment. Our LLM will do it for us.\nassessment. Our LLM will do it for us. We just going to make a call over here.\nWe just going to make a call over here.\nWe just going to make a call over here. So this was the first node. This is the\nSo this was the first node. This is the\nSo this was the first node. This is the next second node. Right? So first we\nnext second node. Right? So first we\nnext second node. Right? So first we categorize the experience. After that\ncategorize the experience. After that\ncategorize the experience. After that happened, we will go to our next node.\nhappened, we will go to our next node.\nhappened, we will go to our next node. And here again what is going to happen?\nAnd here again what is going to happen?\nAnd here again what is going to happen? Our LLM is going to do perform the\nOur LLM is going to do perform the\nOur LLM is going to do perform the action. We're just going to tell that\naction. We're just going to tell that\naction. We're just going to tell that this is the job description. This is the\nthis is the job description. This is the\nthis is the job description. This is the application that we received. Do the\napplication that we received. Do the\napplication that we received. Do the assignment and let me know. Now there\nassignment and let me know. Now there\nassignment and let me know. Now there are two things that are possible. our\nare two things that are possible. our\nare two things that are possible. our LLM will either say it is a match or it\nLLM will either say it is a match or it\nLLM will either say it is a match or it is a mismatch. So what we are going to\nis a mismatch. So what we are going to\nis a mismatch. So what we are going to do is in this particular example how\ndo is in this particular example how\ndo is in this particular example how I've designed it is that if it is a\nI've designed it is that if it is a\nI've designed it is that if it is a match if the job skills is what we are\nmatch if the job skills is what we are\nmatch if the job skills is what we are looking for if the candidate has exactly\nlooking for if the candidate has exactly\nlooking for if the candidate has exactly that skills that is what we are looking\nthat skills that is what we are looking\nthat skills that is what we are looking for then we are just going to schedule\nfor then we are just going to schedule\nfor then we are just going to schedule the HR interview right otherwise so if\nthe HR interview right otherwise so if\nthe HR interview right otherwise so if there is a mismatch then I'm going to\nthere is a mismatch then I'm going to\nthere is a mismatch then I'm going to check the experience of the person if it\ncheck the experience of the person if it\ncheck the experience of the person if it is a very senior level person then the\nis a very senior level person then the\nis a very senior level person then the mismatch can be okay so for that case\nmismatch can be okay so for that case\nmismatch can be okay so for that case I'm going to escalate to the recruiter\nI'm going to escalate to the recruiter\nI'm going to escalate to the recruiter but for entry level and mid-level people\nbut for entry level and mid-level people\nbut for entry level and mid-level people because there are so many people who\nbecause there are so many people who\nbecause there are so many people who apply for just job application without\napply for just job application without\napply for just job application without even checking it out. I'm going to\neven checking it out. I'm going to\neven checking it out. I'm going to reject the application then and there\nreject the application then and there\nreject the application then and there itself. So I'm repeating it here. I will\nitself. So I'm repeating it here. I will\nitself. So I'm repeating it here. I will have one condition. Once I get the reply\nhave one condition. Once I get the reply\nhave one condition. Once I get the reply from LLM, the response from LLM, I will\nfrom LLM, the response from LLM, I will\nfrom LLM, the response from LLM, I will know whether the candidate matches the\nknow whether the candidate matches the\nknow whether the candidate matches the job description that I had put and if\njob description that I had put and if\njob description that I had put and if the application is match or not. If it\nthe application is match or not. If it\nthe application is match or not. If it is match, I'm going to just schedule the\nis match, I'm going to just schedule the\nis match, I'm going to just schedule the HR interview. if it is a mismatch but if\nHR interview. if it is a mismatch but if\nHR interview. if it is a mismatch but if it is a senior level person then I will\nit is a senior level person then I will\nit is a senior level person then I will assume that senior level person so might\nassume that senior level person so might\nassume that senior level person so might have thought of something before\nhave thought of something before\nhave thought of something before applying so I'm going to escalate that\napplying so I'm going to escalate that\napplying so I'm going to escalate that to the recruiter and let recruiter\nto the recruiter and let recruiter\nto the recruiter and let recruiter decide what to do but if it is entry-\ndecide what to do but if it is entry-\ndecide what to do but if it is entry- level or mid-level candidate I'm just\nlevel or mid-level candidate I'm just\nlevel or mid-level candidate I'm just going to reject the application then and\ngoing to reject the application then and\ngoing to reject the application then and there so if you'll see over here there\nthere so if you'll see over here there\nthere so if you'll see over here there is a conditional edge so that is why\nis a conditional edge so that is why\nis a conditional edge so that is why there are toted edges over here there is\nthere are toted edges over here there is\nthere are toted edges over here there is a conditional edge based on the response\na conditional edge based on the response\na conditional edge based on the response that I'm getting over here or based on\nthat I'm getting over here or based on\nthat I'm getting over here or based on some condition I'm making the call uh\nsome condition I'm making the call uh\nsome condition I'm making the call uh that which is the next node that we\nthat which is the next node that we\nthat which is the next node that we should go to. So this is the graph that\nshould go to. So this is the graph that\nshould go to. So this is the graph that we'll be building to understand lang\nwe'll be building to understand lang\nwe'll be building to understand lang graph. Again I'm suggesting just like\ngraph. Again I'm suggesting just like\ngraph. Again I'm suggesting just like other videos. So I'll be going through\nother videos. So I'll be going through\nother videos. So I'll be going through the documentation and teaching your\nthe documentation and teaching your\nthe documentation and teaching your langraph. So I highly recommend it for\nlangraph. So I highly recommend it for\nlangraph. So I highly recommend it for all the new frameworks libraries that\nall the new frameworks libraries that\nall the new frameworks libraries that are coming up. Try to do the same learn\nare coming up. Try to do the same learn\nare coming up. Try to do the same learn to go through the documentation because\nto go through the documentation because\nto go through the documentation because the frameworks and libraries are getting\nthe frameworks and libraries are getting\nthe frameworks and libraries are getting changed very frequently and it is\nchanged very frequently and it is\nchanged very frequently and it is happening for all the libraries out\nhappening for all the libraries out\nhappening for all the libraries out there. There's a lot of development\nthere. There's a lot of development\nthere. There's a lot of development going on over here. If there's any major\ngoing on over here. If there's any major\ngoing on over here. If there's any major update, obviously I'm going to let you\nupdate, obviously I'm going to let you\nupdate, obviously I'm going to let you know and this is there to stay I think\nknow and this is there to stay I think\nknow and this is there to stay I think because lang graph is a very very\nbecause lang graph is a very very\nbecause lang graph is a very very important thing and these concepts are\nimportant thing and these concepts are\nimportant thing and these concepts are going to stay. But still it is a good\ngoing to stay. But still it is a good\ngoing to stay. But still it is a good habit to go through documentation and\nhabit to go through documentation and\nhabit to go through documentation and learn things and that is how I'm\nlearn things and that is how I'm\nlearn things and that is how I'm teaching as well. So you also try to do\nteaching as well. So you also try to do\nteaching as well. So you also try to do the same thing open documentation and\nthe same thing open documentation and\nthe same thing open documentation and try writing the code yourself after\ntry writing the code yourself after\ntry writing the code yourself after watching the video. So watch the video\nwatching the video. So watch the video\nwatching the video. So watch the video then open the documentation and write\nthen open the documentation and write\nthen open the documentation and write the entire code yourself.\nIf you come to the langchain\nIf you come to the langchain documentation here in the ecosystem\ndocumentation here in the ecosystem\ndocumentation here in the ecosystem itself, they have mentioned that lang\nitself, they have mentioned that lang\nitself, they have mentioned that lang graph and lang is part of the ecosystem.\ngraph and lang is part of the ecosystem.\ngraph and lang is part of the ecosystem. Langsmith is basically for inspection,\nLangsmith is basically for inspection,\nLangsmith is basically for inspection, monitoring and evaluation. So you can\nmonitoring and evaluation. So you can\nmonitoring and evaluation. So you can see they have written it for debugging,\nsee they have written it for debugging,\nsee they have written it for debugging, testing, monitoring. Use lang. Uh\ntesting, monitoring. Use lang. Uh\ntesting, monitoring. Use lang. Uh langraph is very very important. So\nlangraph is very very important. So\nlangraph is very very important. So there is also deployment. There's\nthere is also deployment. There's\nthere is also deployment. There's langraph platform for that. Let's go to\nlangraph platform for that. Let's go to\nlangraph platform for that. Let's go to the langraph documentation. It is again\nthe langraph documentation. It is again\nthe langraph documentation. It is again very awesome, right? Everything is\nvery awesome, right? Everything is\nvery awesome, right? Everything is mentioned very nicely. tutorials\nmentioned very nicely. tutorials\nmentioned very nicely. tutorials concepts. So tutorials are actually\nconcepts. So tutorials are actually\nconcepts. So tutorials are actually given very nicely. The chatbot tutorial\ngiven very nicely. The chatbot tutorial\ngiven very nicely. The chatbot tutorial that is given literally you just have to\nthat is given literally you just have to\nthat is given literally you just have to follow it step by step and we'll do that\nfollow it step by step and we'll do that\nfollow it step by step and we'll do that in the coming videos. We'll also do the\nin the coming videos. We'll also do the\nin the coming videos. We'll also do the UI part of that using streamllet.\nUI part of that using streamllet.\nUI part of that using streamllet. There's also documentation given for rag\nThere's also documentation given for rag\nThere's also documentation given for rag and there's a lot of it given. So we'll\nand there's a lot of it given. So we'll\nand there's a lot of it given. So we'll go through all of this one by one. But\ngo through all of this one by one. But\ngo through all of this one by one. But one very uh nice section that I found\none very uh nice section that I found\none very uh nice section that I found like really really helpful for learning\nlike really really helpful for learning\nlike really really helpful for learning the basics. So other than learning the\nthe basics. So other than learning the\nthe basics. So other than learning the basics, what I really suggest you to go\nbasics, what I really suggest you to go\nbasics, what I really suggest you to go through is go to concepts and go through\nthrough is go to concepts and go through\nthrough is go to concepts and go through glossery because here they have\nglossery because here they have\nglossery because here they have explained all the important concepts in\nexplained all the important concepts in\nexplained all the important concepts in such a nice way and this is what we'll\nsuch a nice way and this is what we'll\nsuch a nice way and this is what we'll be following today to build our graph to\nbe following today to build our graph to\nbe following today to build our graph to understand the concepts in very easy\nunderstand the concepts in very easy\nunderstand the concepts in very easy way. They have mentioned everything what\nway. They have mentioned everything what\nway. They have mentioned everything what to do then the steps right everything is\nto do then the steps right everything is\nto do then the steps right everything is given we just have to follow\nthis we'll be writing the code in Google\nthis we'll be writing the code in Google collab and the link to notes of all the\ncollab and the link to notes of all the\ncollab and the link to notes of all the videos in the ML series and the code\nvideos in the ML series and the code\nvideos in the ML series and the code everything is available in the\neverything is available in the\neverything is available in the description you can check that out the\ndescription you can check that out the\ndescription you can check that out the link is there and we are going to get\nlink is there and we are going to get\nlink is there and we are going to get started with some boiler plate code\nstarted with some boiler plate code\nstarted with some boiler plate code first I'm going to be installing all the\nfirst I'm going to be installing all the\nfirst I'm going to be installing all the libraries that we need so we are going\nlibraries that we need so we are going\nlibraries that we need so we are going to be using lang chain lang chain core\nto be using lang chain lang chain core\nto be using lang chain lang chain core lang chain community lang graphs I'm\nlang chain community lang graphs I'm\nlang chain community lang graphs I'm just quickly just installing out of\nminute. Now that the installation is\nminute. Now that the installation is complete, we are going to set up OpenAI\ncomplete, we are going to set up OpenAI\ncomplete, we are going to set up OpenAI API keys. So if you go to the keys part\nAPI keys. So if you go to the keys part\nAPI keys. So if you go to the keys part over here, you can see that I have a lot\nover here, you can see that I have a lot\nover here, you can see that I have a lot of keys and all of them are disabled. So\nof keys and all of them are disabled. So\nof keys and all of them are disabled. So I'm just going to enable it. Copy the\nI'm just going to enable it. Copy the\nI'm just going to enable it. Copy the name of it and I'm going to start using\nname of it and I'm going to start using\nname of it and I'm going to start using it. I so I need to load it. So basically\nit. I so I need to load it. So basically\nit. I so I need to load it. So basically from google\nfrom google\nfrom google collab I need to import user\ncollab I need to import user\ncollab I need to import user data and I'm going to be using os to set\ndata and I'm going to be using os to set\ndata and I'm going to be using os to set the environment\nvariables. It is already giving me\nvariables. It is already giving me autocomplete but here instead of the\nautocomplete but here instead of the\nautocomplete but here instead of the name I had this name. So I'm just going\nname I had this name. So I'm just going\nname I had this name. So I'm just going to copy paste that. So we have the key.\nto copy paste that. So we have the key.\nto copy paste that. So we have the key. So we can also print it to\ncheck. Before starting to build our\ncheck. Before starting to build our graph, there's just one more thing that\ngraph, there's just one more thing that\ngraph, there's just one more thing that we need to do. We need to be able to\nwe need to do. We need to be able to\nwe need to do. We need to be able to connect with our LLM. And for that, we\nconnect with our LLM. And for that, we\nconnect with our LLM. And for that, we create something called chat models.\ncreate something called chat models.\ncreate something called chat models. This part I had already covered in the\nThis part I had already covered in the\nThis part I had already covered in the lang video, but still just quickly\nlang video, but still just quickly\nlang video, but still just quickly covering it again. See, whenever we need\ncovering it again. See, whenever we need\ncovering it again. See, whenever we need to interact with the LLMs, we create\nto interact with the LLMs, we create\nto interact with the LLMs, we create chat models. Now these are different\nchat models. Now these are different\nchat models. Now these are different different models for LLMs. Like for\ndifferent models for LLMs. Like for\ndifferent models for LLMs. Like for example, because here we are going to be\nexample, because here we are going to be\nexample, because here we are going to be using OpenAI LM. So I'm going to be\nusing OpenAI LM. So I'm going to be\nusing OpenAI LM. So I'm going to be creating chat open like this. You can\ncreating chat open like this. You can\ncreating chat open like this. You can use chat anthropic model or any model\nuse chat anthropic model or any model\nuse chat anthropic model or any model that you like mistrill anyone. Okay. So\nthat you like mistrill anyone. Okay. So\nthat you like mistrill anyone. Okay. So I'm going to be creating for openi. So I\nI'm going to be creating for openi. So I\nI'm going to be creating for openi. So I am going to be importing from langchain\nam going to be importing from langchain\nam going to be importing from langchain openai. So they have chat\nopenai. So they have chat\nopenai. So they have chat models and I'm going to be importing\nmodels and I'm going to be importing\nmodels and I'm going to be importing chat\nchat\nchat openai and I don't need this. I just\nopenai and I don't need this. I just\nopenai and I don't need this. I just need to create\nlm and just to show you some basic\nlm and just to show you some basic stuff. So now you can invoke any\nstuff. So now you can invoke any\nstuff. So now you can invoke any messages like this. So you can do who is\nmessages like this. So you can do who is\nmessages like this. So you can do who is the PM of India and you should be able\nthe PM of India and you should be able\nthe PM of India and you should be able to run this and you should be able to\nto run this and you should be able to\nto run this and you should be able to get the response. So you can see it is\nget the response. So you can see it is\nget the response. So you can see it is under the content section. Right? So I'm\nunder the content section. Right? So I'm\nunder the content section. Right? So I'm not going to be focusing a lot on this.\nnot going to be focusing a lot on this.\nnot going to be focusing a lot on this. This part we have already covered. Now\nThis part we have already covered. Now\nThis part we have already covered. Now let's get started with building our\ngraph. Coming back to the documentation\ngraph. Coming back to the documentation here we can see our graphs basically\nhere we can see our graphs basically\nhere we can see our graphs basically have three key components. See from the\nhave three key components. See from the\nhave three key components. See from the names nodes and edges you should be able\nnames nodes and edges you should be able\nnames nodes and edges you should be able to understand a bit from the\nto understand a bit from the\nto understand a bit from the visualization of the graphs itself.\nvisualization of the graphs itself.\nvisualization of the graphs itself. Nodes are the nodes of the graph and the\nNodes are the nodes of the graph and the\nNodes are the nodes of the graph and the connections are called edges. This is\nconnections are called edges. This is\nconnections are called edges. This is fairly easy. But the most important part\nfairly easy. But the most important part\nfairly easy. But the most important part in lang in lang graph is actually state.\nin lang in lang graph is actually state.\nin lang in lang graph is actually state. So it is very very important. If you see\nSo it is very very important. If you see\nSo it is very very important. If you see over here even in nodes see nodes\nover here even in nodes see nodes\nover here even in nodes see nodes receive the current state as input. They\nreceive the current state as input. They\nreceive the current state as input. They perform some computation or side effect\nperform some computation or side effect\nperform some computation or side effect and return an updated state. So state is\nand return an updated state. So state is\nand return an updated state. So state is very very important even edges. So what\nvery very important even edges. So what\nvery very important even edges. So what they do is they determine which node to\nthey do is they determine which node to\nthey do is they determine which node to execute next based on the current state.\nexecute next based on the current state.\nexecute next based on the current state. Again state is very very important. So\nAgain state is very very important. So\nAgain state is very very important. So if I go down you can see the first thing\nif I go down you can see the first thing\nif I go down you can see the first thing you do when you define a graph is define\nyou do when you define a graph is define\nyou do when you define a graph is define the state of the graph. So we know we\nthe state of the graph. So we know we\nthe state of the graph. So we know we need to define the state of the graph.\nneed to define the state of the graph.\nneed to define the state of the graph. How do we do that? And what is state?\nHow do we do that? And what is state?\nHow do we do that? And what is state? First of all see state is nothing but\nFirst of all see state is nothing but\nFirst of all see state is nothing but schema of the graph. Now what is schema\nschema of the graph. Now what is schema\nschema of the graph. Now what is schema of the graph? Basically in very simple\nof the graph? Basically in very simple\nof the graph? Basically in very simple terms the data that we are storing like\nterms the data that we are storing like\nterms the data that we are storing like for example the example that we have\nfor example the example that we have\nfor example the example that we have taken what all things will we store we\ntaken what all things will we store we\ntaken what all things will we store we will store application we will store\nwill store application we will store\nwill store application we will store experience level we will store whether\nexperience level we will store whether\nexperience level we will store whether the skills matched or not and some\nthe skills matched or not and some\nthe skills matched or not and some response right so these are all the data\nresponse right so these are all the data\nresponse right so these are all the data that we need to save and this data is\nthat we need to save and this data is\nthat we need to save and this data is going to be updated as we go across the\ngoing to be updated as we go across the\ngoing to be updated as we go across the nodes. So initially suppose we were in\nnodes. So initially suppose we were in\nnodes. So initially suppose we were in one node and after that we analyze the\none node and after that we analyze the\none node and after that we analyze the experience level. Now when we go to the\nexperience level. Now when we go to the\nexperience level. Now when we go to the next node the state would be updated\nnext node the state would be updated\nnext node the state would be updated right. So that is exactly what do what\nright. So that is exactly what do what\nright. So that is exactly what do what we do in nodes. So we take the input we\nwe do in nodes. So we take the input we\nwe do in nodes. So we take the input we perform some computation and we return\nperform some computation and we return\nperform some computation and we return an updated state. So state is that data\nan updated state. So state is that data\nan updated state. So state is that data that is being updated. So that is going\nthat is being updated. So that is going\nthat is being updated. So that is going to be there throughout a workflow.\nto be there throughout a workflow.\nto be there throughout a workflow. Workflow meaning the graph flow that we\nWorkflow meaning the graph flow that we\nWorkflow meaning the graph flow that we have. So in one entire workflow you're\nhave. So in one entire workflow you're\nhave. So in one entire workflow you're going to have one particular state. So\ngoing to have one particular state. So\ngoing to have one particular state. So if you execute again your state is\nif you execute again your state is\nif you execute again your state is obviously going to change but in that\nobviously going to change but in that\nobviously going to change but in that workflow your state is going to be\nworkflow your state is going to be\nworkflow your state is going to be updated. Your data is going to be\nupdated. Your data is going to be\nupdated. Your data is going to be updated. We understood that we need to\nupdated. We understood that we need to\nupdated. We understood that we need to define the state of the graph. But how\ndefine the state of the graph. But how\ndefine the state of the graph. But how does it look like? See state of the\ndoes it look like? See state of the\ndoes it look like? See state of the graph is nothing but a type dictionary.\ngraph is nothing but a type dictionary.\ngraph is nothing but a type dictionary. In very simple terms it's just a\nIn very simple terms it's just a\nIn very simple terms it's just a dictionary where we are having extra tag\ndictionary where we are having extra tag\ndictionary where we are having extra tag checking. Basically for every data that\nchecking. Basically for every data that\nchecking. Basically for every data that we're going to store like for example\nwe're going to store like for example\nwe're going to store like for example we're going to store application or\nwe're going to store application or\nwe're going to store application or we're going to store anything right. So\nwe're going to store anything right. So\nwe're going to store anything right. So that we are going to tell that this is\nthat we are going to tell that this is\nthat we are going to tell that this is going to be of what type. So in our case\ngoing to be of what type. So in our case\ngoing to be of what type. So in our case suppose we say that our application is\nsuppose we say that our application is\nsuppose we say that our application is of going to be of the type string. So we\nof going to be of the type string. So we\nof going to be of the type string. So we need to mention over there so that there\nneed to mention over there so that there\nneed to mention over there so that there is type checking to make sure that the\nis type checking to make sure that the\nis type checking to make sure that the state is like the data in the state is\nstate is like the data in the state is\nstate is like the data in the state is of the same type throughout the\nof the same type throughout the\nof the same type throughout the workflow. So we are going to create type\nworkflow. So we are going to create type\nworkflow. So we are going to create type dictionary and that is how we're going\ndictionary and that is how we're going\ndictionary and that is how we're going to create the state. So let's go back to\nto create the state. So let's go back to\nto create the state. So let's go back to our code and let's start creating it. So\nour code and let's start creating it. So\nour code and let's start creating it. So we are going to create state and here I\nwe are going to create state and here I\nwe are going to create state and here I need to have typed dictionary and how to\nneed to have typed dictionary and how to\nneed to have typed dictionary and how to import that see it already gave from\nimport that see it already gave from\nimport that see it already gave from typing I'm importing or you can also\ntyping I'm importing or you can also\ntyping I'm importing or you can also import from typing extensions I'm\nimport from typing extensions I'm\nimport from typing extensions I'm importing type dictionary and in this\nimporting type dictionary and in this\nimporting type dictionary and in this state what are the things that we are\nstate what are the things that we are\nstate what are the things that we are going to keep we are going to keep\ngoing to keep we are going to keep\ngoing to keep we are going to keep application so that is going to be of\napplication so that is going to be of\napplication so that is going to be of the type string we are going to have\nthe type string we are going to have\nthe type string we are going to have experience\nexperience\nexperience level again of the type string we are\nlevel again of the type string we are\nlevel again of the type string we are going to have skill match again of the\ngoing to have skill match again of the\ngoing to have skill match again of the type string. So currently I'm just\ntype string. So currently I'm just\ntype string. So currently I'm just taking everything as a string\nitself. So we are done defining the\nitself. So we are done defining the state of the graph. Let's see what to do\nstate of the graph. Let's see what to do\nstate of the graph. Let's see what to do next. Let's go back to the\nnext. Let's go back to the\nnext. Let's go back to the documentation. So here if we go back the\ndocumentation. So here if we go back the\ndocumentation. So here if we go back the next thing that we obviously have to do\nnext thing that we obviously have to do\nnext thing that we obviously have to do is create the graph. So here it is given\nis create the graph. So here it is given\nis create the graph. So here it is given the state graph class is the main graph\nthe state graph class is the main graph\nthe state graph class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by a\nclass to use. This is parameterized by a\nclass to use. This is parameterized by a userdefined state object. So we just\nuserdefined state object. So we just\nuserdefined state object. So we just defined one state object right? So that\ndefined one state object right? So that\ndefined one state object right? So that is the userdefined state object. We need\nis the userdefined state object. We need\nis the userdefined state object. We need to send that as a parameter to create\nto send that as a parameter to create\nto send that as a parameter to create the state graph. Obvious right? So let's\nthe state graph. Obvious right? So let's\nthe state graph. Obvious right? So let's do that. Let's run this and from lang\ngraph I'm going to import state\ngraph I'm going to import state graph and we are going to create a state\ngraph and we are going to create a state\ngraph and we are going to create a state graph that is going to be our\ngraph that is going to be our\ngraph that is going to be our workflow and in this I obviously need to\nworkflow and in this I obviously need to\nworkflow and in this I obviously need to send my state\nSo we are done defining our state graph.\nSo we are done defining our state graph. Now we need to start adding the nodes at\nNow we need to start adding the nodes at\nNow we need to start adding the nodes at the edges to it. In order to add nodes,\nthe edges to it. In order to add nodes,\nthe edges to it. In order to add nodes, let's go back to our documentation. And\nlet's go back to our documentation. And\nlet's go back to our documentation. And here if we go to the node section here,\nhere if we go to the node section here,\nhere if we go to the node section here, we can see that see how they are doing\nwe can see that see how they are doing\nwe can see that see how they are doing it. Let's look at the example first. So\nit. Let's look at the example first. So\nit. Let's look at the example first. So they are also building one state graph.\nthey are also building one state graph.\nthey are also building one state graph. They are calling it builder. We called\nThey are calling it builder. We called\nThey are calling it builder. We called it workflow. Right? And here in order to\nit workflow. Right? And here in order to\nit workflow. Right? And here in order to add node, they have called a function\nadd node, they have called a function\nadd node, they have called a function called add node. And here they are\ncalled add node. And here they are\ncalled add node. And here they are passing one node name. So this can be\npassing one node name. So this can be\npassing one node name. So this can be either my node or the node. This can be\neither my node or the node. This can be\neither my node or the node. This can be anything. This is the name of the node\nanything. This is the name of the node\nanything. This is the name of the node that you will see in the diagram. And\nthat you will see in the diagram. And\nthat you will see in the diagram. And this is the function corresponding to\nthis is the function corresponding to\nthis is the function corresponding to it. So every node is supposed to perform\nit. So every node is supposed to perform\nit. So every node is supposed to perform some action, right? That action will be\nsome action, right? That action will be\nsome action, right? That action will be obviously written in a function in a\nobviously written in a function in a\nobviously written in a function in a method. Now what will it take? See, it\nmethod. Now what will it take? See, it\nmethod. Now what will it take? See, it takes here it is given. So the first\ntakes here it is given. So the first\ntakes here it is given. So the first positional argument is the state, right?\npositional argument is the state, right?\npositional argument is the state, right? So state is what we need to pass. That\nSo state is what we need to pass. That\nSo state is what we need to pass. That is what we had seen at the top as well.\nis what we had seen at the top as well.\nis what we had seen at the top as well. So here we saw that they receive the\nSo here we saw that they receive the\nSo here we saw that they receive the current state as the input perform some\ncurrent state as the input perform some\ncurrent state as the input perform some computation or side effect and return an\ncomputation or side effect and return an\ncomputation or side effect and return an updated state. So we also need to return\nupdated state. So we also need to return\nupdated state. So we also need to return an updated state. Right? So if I go back\nan updated state. Right? So if I go back\nan updated state. Right? So if I go back over here we are passing one state and\nover here we are passing one state and\nover here we are passing one state and we will also return one state. This is\nwe will also return one state. This is\nwe will also return one state. This is basically returning a dictionary which\nbasically returning a dictionary which\nbasically returning a dictionary which is state itself. Right? Here if you see\nis state itself. Right? Here if you see\nis state itself. Right? Here if you see they have also given one second\nthey have also given one second\nthey have also given one second positional argument but that is optional\npositional argument but that is optional\npositional argument but that is optional and that is configuration. We are not\nand that is configuration. We are not\nand that is configuration. We are not going to be talking about that not\ngoing to be talking about that not\ngoing to be talking about that not needed in our example. So what we are\nneeded in our example. So what we are\nneeded in our example. So what we are going to do is we just need to do\ngoing to do is we just need to do\ngoing to do is we just need to do workflow dot add node. Give the name of\nworkflow dot add node. Give the name of\nworkflow dot add node. Give the name of the node and the function corresponding\nthe node and the function corresponding\nthe node and the function corresponding to it. So let's quickly write that code.\nto it. So let's quickly write that code.\nto it. So let's quickly write that code. What is the first node that we should be\nWhat is the first node that we should be\nWhat is the first node that we should be creating? Uh in our example, what was\ncreating? Uh in our example, what was\ncreating? Uh in our example, what was the first thing that we were supposed to\nthe first thing that we were supposed to\nthe first thing that we were supposed to do? Whatever application we are getting\ndo? Whatever application we are getting\ndo? Whatever application we are getting of the candidate, we need to categorize\nof the candidate, we need to categorize\nof the candidate, we need to categorize it to one of the three levels entry\nit to one of the three levels entry\nit to one of the three levels entry level, mid-level or senior level. Right?\nlevel, mid-level or senior level. Right?\nlevel, mid-level or senior level. Right? So let's do that. We have the workflow\nSo let's do that. We have the workflow\nSo let's do that. We have the workflow now. So now I need to start adding the\nnow. So now I need to start adding the\nnow. So now I need to start adding the nodes. So I'm going to do workflow dot\nnodes. So I'm going to do workflow dot\nnodes. So I'm going to do workflow dot add node. And here I'm going to give the\nadd node. And here I'm going to give the\nadd node. And here I'm going to give the name as say\nname as say\nname as say categorize\ncategorize\ncategorize experience. This will be the name of the\nexperience. This will be the name of the\nexperience. This will be the name of the node. And I need to write a function. So\nnode. And I need to write a function. So\nnode. And I need to write a function. So I'm going to give the same name to that.\nI'm going to give the same name to that.\nI'm going to give the same name to that. So I need to write the function now. Now\nSo I need to write the function now. Now\nSo I need to write the function now. Now when I define the function, what is\nwhen I define the function, what is\nwhen I define the function, what is going to be the input? See it is giving\ngoing to be the input? See it is giving\ngoing to be the input? See it is giving me autocomplete. It is going to take the\nme autocomplete. It is going to take the\nme autocomplete. It is going to take the state as the input and it is going to\nstate as the input and it is going to\nstate as the input and it is going to return the state itself. So obviously\nreturn the state itself. So obviously\nreturn the state itself. So obviously the return part I don't need to write\nthe return part I don't need to write\nthe return part I don't need to write but it is obviously nice to write it.\nbut it is obviously nice to write it.\nbut it is obviously nice to write it. I'm going to write a simple print\nI'm going to write a simple print\nI'm going to write a simple print statement over here just to for further\nstatement over here just to for further\nstatement over here just to for further clarity and I'm going to write\nclarity and I'm going to write\nclarity and I'm going to write categorizing the experience\nlevel and in this function what am I\nlevel and in this function what am I supposed to do I am basically supposed\nsupposed to do I am basically supposed\nsupposed to do I am basically supposed to make a call to my LLM and say that\nto make a call to my LLM and say that\nto make a call to my LLM and say that you categorize the candidate I am not\nyou categorize the candidate I am not\nyou categorize the candidate I am not actually doing it LLM is going to do us\nactually doing it LLM is going to do us\nactually doing it LLM is going to do us we are leveraging LLM right that is why\nwe are leveraging LLM right that is why\nwe are leveraging LLM right that is why LLM based apps so what do I need to do I\nLLM based apps so what do I need to do I\nLLM based apps so what do I need to do I need to create a prompt to be able to\nneed to create a prompt to be able to\nneed to create a prompt to be able to sent to my uh LLM. Now in order to do\nsent to my uh LLM. Now in order to do\nsent to my uh LLM. Now in order to do that I need to import. See I could have\nthat I need to import. See I could have\nthat I need to import. See I could have actually imported in once and kept\nactually imported in once and kept\nactually imported in once and kept everything but I just wanted you to\neverything but I just wanted you to\neverything but I just wanted you to understand that why am I importing\nunderstand that why am I importing\nunderstand that why am I importing whatever I am importing. So just for\nwhatever I am importing. So just for\nwhatever I am importing. So just for further clarity I'm just doing it as we\nfurther clarity I'm just doing it as we\nfurther clarity I'm just doing it as we are writing the\nare writing the\nare writing the code. So from the prompts I am going to\ncode. So from the prompts I am going to\ncode. So from the prompts I am going to import chat prompt\nimport chat prompt\nimport chat prompt template and I'm going to create a\ntemplate and I'm going to create a\ntemplate and I'm going to create a prompt now. And this part we have\nprompt now. And this part we have\nprompt now. And this part we have already covered it in the lang chain\nalready covered it in the lang chain\nalready covered it in the lang chain video but just quickly covering it\nvideo but just quickly covering it\nvideo but just quickly covering it again. See whenever we need to send uh\nagain. See whenever we need to send uh\nagain. See whenever we need to send uh something to our LLM right so we could\nsomething to our LLM right so we could\nsomething to our LLM right so we could either do just chain.invoke like that.\neither do just chain.invoke like that.\neither do just chain.invoke like that. But what if I want to give something as\nBut what if I want to give something as\nBut what if I want to give something as input like in this case we have to give\ninput like in this case we have to give\ninput like in this case we have to give application as the input right? So I\napplication as the input right? So I\napplication as the input right? So I need to form a prompt and pass that. Now\nneed to form a prompt and pass that. Now\nneed to form a prompt and pass that. Now again the prompt can be formed either\nagain the prompt can be formed either\nagain the prompt can be formed either from me messages or from templates. So\nfrom me messages or from templates. So\nfrom me messages or from templates. So if you already know lang is like a quick\nif you already know lang is like a quick\nif you already know lang is like a quick revision for you. So I could also do it\nrevision for you. So I could also do it\nrevision for you. So I could also do it from messages which is a concept if you\nfrom messages which is a concept if you\nfrom messages which is a concept if you don't know that it's fine for now. So\ndon't know that it's fine for now. So\ndon't know that it's fine for now. So what I'm doing is I am forming from\nwhat I'm doing is I am forming from\nwhat I'm doing is I am forming from template which is basically very simple.\ntemplate which is basically very simple.\ntemplate which is basically very simple. I am basically going to just pass this\nI am basically going to just pass this\nI am basically going to just pass this string and this string is going to be\nstring and this string is going to be\nstring and this string is going to be used as the template. Now in this string\nused as the template. Now in this string\nused as the template. Now in this string I could also pass my uh whatever is the\nI could also pass my uh whatever is the\nI could also pass my uh whatever is the input like in this case the application\ninput like in this case the application\ninput like in this case the application itself is going to be the input that I'm\nitself is going to be the input that I'm\nitself is going to be the input that I'm going to pass over here. Right? So I'm\ngoing to pass over here. Right? So I'm\ngoing to pass over here. Right? So I'm just going to write a simple string that\njust going to write a simple string that\njust going to write a simple string that based on the application like the job\nbased on the application like the job\nbased on the application like the job application just categorize into one of\napplication just categorize into one of\napplication just categorize into one of the three levels. So just give me one\nsec and I obviously need to tell that\nsec and I obviously need to tell that you you can categorize into what levels\nyou you can categorize into what levels\nyou you can categorize into what levels right so that we are telling the LLM\nright so that we are telling the LLM\nright so that we are telling the LLM that these are the different levels that\nthat these are the different levels that\nthat these are the different levels that can be\npossible and in order to pass the input\npossible and in order to pass the input I'm just going to write it\nI'm just going to write it\nI'm just going to write it properly I can just give the input also\nproperly I can just give the input also\nproperly I can just give the input also over So I'm going to pass my application\nover So I'm going to pass my application\nover So I'm going to pass my application as the\nas the\nas the input and this is my\ninput. So we are done creating a prompt.\ninput. So we are done creating a prompt. Now in order to send it to our LLM, we\nNow in order to send it to our LLM, we\nNow in order to send it to our LLM, we are obviously going to create a chain.\nare obviously going to create a chain.\nare obviously going to create a chain. This is the lang chain chain. And\nThis is the lang chain chain. And\nThis is the lang chain chain. And whatever is the output from this prompt,\nwhatever is the output from this prompt,\nwhatever is the output from this prompt, I am going to pass it to my llm. Right?\nI am going to pass it to my llm. Right?\nI am going to pass it to my llm. Right? I could also in uh like just I could\nI could also in uh like just I could\nI could also in uh like just I could also parse it out over here. Just do a\nalso parse it out over here. Just do a\nalso parse it out over here. Just do a str out parser. But why do I need to\nstr out parser. But why do I need to\nstr out parser. But why do I need to parse? Because whatever is the output\nparse? Because whatever is the output\nparse? Because whatever is the output that I get from the LLM is going to have\nthat I get from the LLM is going to have\nthat I get from the LLM is going to have a lot of things. One of the things like\na lot of things. One of the things like\na lot of things. One of the things like the output that we want like in this\nthe output that we want like in this\nthe output that we want like in this case we want this experience level,\ncase we want this experience level,\ncase we want this experience level, right? This is going to be present under\nright? This is going to be present under\nright? This is going to be present under the content section. So I could also use\nthe content section. So I could also use\nthe content section. So I could also use this parser to take it out and I see it\nthis parser to take it out and I see it\nthis parser to take it out and I see it is giving me autocomplete just parse it\nis giving me autocomplete just parse it\nis giving me autocomplete just parse it and give it as the state right. So this\nand give it as the state right. So this\nand give it as the state right. So this is the state. I could either write code\nis the state. I could either write code\nis the state. I could either write code that like that also or just to print it\nthat like that also or just to print it\nthat like that also or just to print it I am just going to assign it in a\nI am just going to assign it in a\nI am just going to assign it in a different variable.\nAnd I'm going to invoke chain like\nAnd I'm going to invoke chain like this. And in this chain, so basically\nthis. And in this chain, so basically\nthis. And in this chain, so basically whatever needs to be passed to the\nwhatever needs to be passed to the\nwhatever needs to be passed to the prompt as an input. So in this case it\nprompt as an input. So in this case it\nprompt as an input. So in this case it is application that I need to give over\nis application that I need to give over\nis application that I need to give over here as dictionary. So I need to pass\nhere as dictionary. So I need to pass\nhere as dictionary. So I need to pass this application right and from where am\nthis application right and from where am\nthis application right and from where am I going to get the application? So in my\nI going to get the application? So in my\nI going to get the application? So in my node what is there? State is there. So\nnode what is there? State is there. So\nnode what is there? State is there. So that state has the application, right?\nthat state has the application, right?\nthat state has the application, right? So our state has application. So how am\nSo our state has application. So how am\nSo our state has application. So how am I going to get this application from my\nI going to get this application from my\nI going to get this application from my state? So now that I have passed\nstate? So now that I have passed\nstate? So now that I have passed application as a dictionary, my prompt\napplication as a dictionary, my prompt\napplication as a dictionary, my prompt will have access to the application. So\nwill have access to the application. So\nwill have access to the application. So prompt is there. Whatever is going to be\nprompt is there. Whatever is going to be\nprompt is there. Whatever is going to be the output of the prompt uh will be\nthe output of the prompt uh will be\nthe output of the prompt uh will be passed to LLM. Then from LLM, I'm going\npassed to LLM. Then from LLM, I'm going\npassed to LLM. Then from LLM, I'm going to get some response and I'm going to\nto get some response and I'm going to\nto get some response and I'm going to take out the content of that and that is\ntake out the content of that and that is\ntake out the content of that and that is my experience level. Now I can just\nmy experience level. Now I can just\nmy experience level. Now I can just return the\ndictionary and for further clarity let\ndictionary and for further clarity let me just add a print statement as well so\nme just add a print statement as well so\nme just add a print statement as well so that we also can see it\nproperly and that's it. We are done\nproperly and that's it. We are done adding one node to our workflow. So\nadding one node to our workflow. So\nadding one node to our workflow. So basically we have added one node to our\nbasically we have added one node to our\nbasically we have added one node to our graph. Similarly for the other nodes\ngraph. Similarly for the other nodes\ngraph. Similarly for the other nodes also we need to start writing the\nalso we need to start writing the\nalso we need to start writing the different functions. So let me just\ndifferent functions. So let me just\ndifferent functions. So let me just quickly first write the functions for\nquickly first write the functions for\nquickly first write the functions for all the nodes and then we are going to\nall the nodes and then we are going to\nall the nodes and then we are going to form our proper graph by adding the\nform our proper graph by adding the\nform our proper graph by adding the different nodes and the ed edges. First\ndifferent nodes and the ed edges. First\ndifferent nodes and the ed edges. First let's quickly write the functions right.\nlet's quickly write the functions right.\nlet's quickly write the functions right. So what are the different nodes that I'm\nSo what are the different nodes that I'm\nSo what are the different nodes that I'm going to have? One is categorize\ngoing to have? One is categorize\ngoing to have? One is categorize experience that we have already written.\nexperience that we have already written.\nexperience that we have already written. The next one was assess skills right\nThe next one was assess skills right\nThe next one was assess skills right where we were actually assessing the\nwhere we were actually assessing the\nwhere we were actually assessing the skills of the candidates. And here again\nskills of the candidates. And here again\nskills of the candidates. And here again I'm going to pass the state. So it is\nI'm going to pass the state. So it is\nI'm going to pass the state. So it is actually giving me the autocomplete\nactually giving me the autocomplete\nactually giving me the autocomplete state and we are have we have added a\nstate and we are have we have added a\nstate and we are have we have added a print statement assessing the skill set\nprint statement assessing the skill set\nprint statement assessing the skill set of the candidate. So that is great. See\nof the candidate. So that is great. See\nof the candidate. So that is great. See here also I'm just going to form a\nhere also I'm just going to form a\nhere also I'm just going to form a prompt then do the change exactly the\nprompt then do the change exactly the\nprompt then do the change exactly the same thing. Oh it is also giving me an\nsame thing. Oh it is also giving me an\nsame thing. Oh it is also giving me an autocomplete prompt chat form template\nautocomplete prompt chat form template\nautocomplete prompt chat form template based on the following job application\nbased on the following job application\nbased on the following job application assess the candidates skill set but here\nassess the candidates skill set but here\nassess the candidates skill set but here also let's also mention that what are\nalso let's also mention that what are\nalso let's also mention that what are the job requirements right? So based on\nthe job requirements right? So based on\nthe job requirements right? So based on the following job application. So based\nthe following job application. So based\nthe following job application. So based on the job application say for a Python\non the job application say for a Python\non the job application say for a Python developer. So I'm just giving two words\ndeveloper. So I'm just giving two words\ndeveloper. So I'm just giving two words right. But in reality obviously job\nright. But in reality obviously job\nright. But in reality obviously job description can be a lot like you can\ndescription can be a lot like you can\ndescription can be a lot like you can give that what are the other text tags\ngive that what are the other text tags\ngive that what are the other text tags or the number of years of experience or\nor the number of years of experience or\nor the number of years of experience or anything right? So you can give a lot of\nanything right? So you can give a lot of\nanything right? So you can give a lot of things. What are the libraries the\nthings. What are the libraries the\nthings. What are the libraries the frameworks the person has worked on or\nframeworks the person has worked on or\nframeworks the person has worked on or anything like that right? So to the\nanything like that right? So to the\nanything like that right? So to the person does the person have like DevOps\nperson does the person have like DevOps\nperson does the person have like DevOps experience. So you can give a lot of\nexperience. So you can give a lot of\nexperience. So you can give a lot of things over here and based on the entire\nthings over here and based on the entire\nthings over here and based on the entire job application we are going to assess\njob application we are going to assess\njob application we are going to assess and here I also want our LLM to\nand here I also want our LLM to\nand here I also want our LLM to respond\nwith\nwith either match or no\nmatch. Again I have the prompt. I need\nmatch. Again I have the prompt. I need to pass that to my\nLLM. And again I'm going to get the\nLLM. And again I'm going to get the response which will be skill match. And\nresponse which will be skill match. And\nresponse which will be skill match. And we are going to invoke our chain in our\nwe are going to invoke our chain in our\nwe are going to invoke our chain in our application. We are going to have state\napplication. We are going to have state\napplication. We are going to have state application and we are going to get the\napplication and we are going to get the\napplication and we are going to get the content out of it from which we'll get\ncontent out of it from which we'll get\ncontent out of it from which we'll get the skill match and we just printing it\nthe skill match and we just printing it\nthe skill match and we just printing it and returning it. Right? Similarly, so\nand returning it. Right? Similarly, so\nand returning it. Right? Similarly, so this is the second note. What is what\nthis is the second note. What is what\nthis is the second note. What is what are the other notes that we have? So one\nare the other notes that we have? So one\nare the other notes that we have? So one is going to be for scheduling the HR\nis going to be for scheduling the HR\nis going to be for scheduling the HR interview. So when is this going to\ninterview. So when is this going to\ninterview. So when is this going to happen? If we have a match, right? So in\nhappen? If we have a match, right? So in\nhappen? If we have a match, right? So in reality, see in real cases, obviously\nreality, see in real cases, obviously\nreality, see in real cases, obviously scheduling can be a task that you can\nscheduling can be a task that you can\nscheduling can be a task that you can perform like you can probably uh trigger\nperform like you can probably uh trigger\nperform like you can probably uh trigger a mail or something like that, right? Uh\na mail or something like that, right? Uh\na mail or something like that, right? Uh you can schedule properly, but currently\nyou can schedule properly, but currently\nyou can schedule properly, but currently obviously this is demo. So I'm just\nobviously this is demo. So I'm just\nobviously this is demo. So I'm just going to add basic print statements and\ngoing to add basic print statements and\ngoing to add basic print statements and return it\non and we are going to be scheduling the\non and we are going to be scheduling the interview. So this is the print\ninterview. So this is the print\ninterview. So this is the print statement. I'm just returning the\nstatement. I'm just returning the\nstatement. I'm just returning the response from there.\nAnd for further clarity, let's just call\nAnd for further clarity, let's just call this schedule HR interview. So what were\nthis schedule HR interview. So what were\nthis schedule HR interview. So what were the three possibilities? One is schedule\nthe three possibilities? One is schedule\nthe three possibilities? One is schedule HR interview. The other is escalate to\nHR interview. The other is escalate to\nHR interview. The other is escalate to recruiter. Right? So when were we doing\nrecruiter. Right? So when were we doing\nrecruiter. Right? So when were we doing that? So in case there is senior level\nthat? So in case there is senior level\nthat? So in case there is senior level but there is senior level basically\nbut there is senior level basically\nbut there is senior level basically candidate and there is a mismatch then\ncandidate and there is a mismatch then\ncandidate and there is a mismatch then we can escalate to the recruiter. So\nwe can escalate to the recruiter. So\nwe can escalate to the recruiter. So that is the logic that I am writing. You\nthat is the logic that I am writing. You\nthat is the logic that I am writing. You can write anything right. So you must be\ncan write anything right. So you must be\ncan write anything right. So you must be thinking where to write that logic.\nthinking where to write that logic.\nthinking where to write that logic. We'll look at that as well. Don't worry.\nWe'll look at that as well. Don't worry.\nWe'll look at that as well. Don't worry. So we are going to scale it to\nSo we are going to scale it to\nSo we are going to scale it to recruiter.\nAnd the last case is that when we are\nAnd the last case is that when we are going to simply\nreject here again you could be actually\nreject here again you could be actually sending the email but so this could be\nsending the email but so this could be\nsending the email but so this could be automated right. So here you just have\nautomated right. So here you just have\nautomated right. So here you just have to send the mail. So they could be logic\nto send the mail. So they could be logic\nto send the mail. So they could be logic say to Mailchimp or something. But\nsay to Mailchimp or something. But\nsay to Mailchimp or something. But obviously for demo purposes I'm just\nobviously for demo purposes I'm just\nobviously for demo purposes I'm just adding a print\nstatement. So these are all the\nstatement. So these are all the functions that we needed. We already\nfunctions that we needed. We already\nfunctions that we needed. We already have one node and let's start adding the\nhave one node and let's start adding the\nhave one node and let's start adding the other nodes as well. Quickly adding the\nother nodes as well. Quickly adding the\nother nodes as well. Quickly adding the other workflow nodes as well. So\nother workflow nodes as well. So\nother workflow nodes as well. So workflow do add node and we're just\nworkflow do add node and we're just\nworkflow do add node and we're just going to quickly give the names and add.\ngoing to quickly give the names and add.\ngoing to quickly give the names and add. So I'm not adding over here because it\nSo I'm not adding over here because it\nSo I'm not adding over here because it is going to give me the error that this\nis going to give me the error that this\nis going to give me the error that this is already present. So I'm just going to\nis already present. So I'm just going to\nis already present. So I'm just going to add in the other cell. So I'm just going\nadd in the other cell. So I'm just going\nadd in the other cell. So I'm just going to just copy paste all the functions and\nto just copy paste all the functions and\nto just copy paste all the functions and give the same names. So as a skill set\ngive the same names. So as a skill set\ngive the same names. So as a skill set and this is going to be the function.\nand this is going to be the function.\nand this is going to be the function. Similarly let's just give for others as\nSimilarly let's just give for others as\nSimilarly let's just give for others as well quickly.\nNow that we have added all the nodes,\nNow that we have added all the nodes, it's time to add the\nedges. In order to add edges, let's go\nedges. In order to add edges, let's go back to the documentation. Let's go to\nback to the documentation. Let's go to\nback to the documentation. Let's go to the edges part. And here it is given\nthe edges part. And here it is given\nthe edges part. And here it is given that there are different types of edges.\nthat there are different types of edges.\nthat there are different types of edges. So first let's look at normal edges.\nSo first let's look at normal edges.\nSo first let's look at normal edges. Here basically we have to go we have to\nHere basically we have to go we have to\nHere basically we have to go we have to give that we want to go directly from\ngive that we want to go directly from\ngive that we want to go directly from one node to the next. So we can just do\none node to the next. So we can just do\none node to the next. So we can just do graph add edge and node A to node B we\ngraph add edge and node A to node B we\ngraph add edge and node A to node B we want to go. So here we can just mention\nwant to go. So here we can just mention\nwant to go. So here we can just mention that these two nodes add an edge between\nthat these two nodes add an edge between\nthat these two nodes add an edge between them. So the first edge that we also\nthem. So the first edge that we also\nthem. So the first edge that we also want to add is actually very simple. So\nwant to add is actually very simple. So\nwant to add is actually very simple. So all I'm going to do is add edge and what\nall I'm going to do is add edge and what\nall I'm going to do is add edge and what are the different nodes between which I\nare the different nodes between which I\nare the different nodes between which I need to create. So I want to create from\nneed to create. So I want to create from\nneed to create. So I want to create from categorize experience from categorize\ncategorize experience from categorize\ncategorize experience from categorize experience to the assess skill set part.\nexperience to the assess skill set part.\nexperience to the assess skill set part. So here I am adding a simple normal edge\nSo here I am adding a simple normal edge\nSo here I am adding a simple normal edge between categorize experience and assess\nbetween categorize experience and assess\nbetween categorize experience and assess skill set. But what after assess a skill\nskill set. But what after assess a skill\nskill set. But what after assess a skill set? See after we are done assessing\nset? See after we are done assessing\nset? See after we are done assessing skill set we are making a decision based\nskill set we are making a decision based\nskill set we are making a decision based on the skills that whether we want to\non the skills that whether we want to\non the skills that whether we want to schedule HR interview or we want to\nschedule HR interview or we want to\nschedule HR interview or we want to escalate or do we want to reject the\nescalate or do we want to reject the\nescalate or do we want to reject the application. So let's go back to the\napplication. So let's go back to the\napplication. So let's go back to the documentation. Here there is something\ndocumentation. Here there is something\ndocumentation. Here there is something called conditional edges. And here it is\ncalled conditional edges. And here it is\ncalled conditional edges. And here it is given to us that when we do graft at add\ngiven to us that when we do graft at add\ngiven to us that when we do graft at add conditional edges we can give after\nconditional edges we can give after\nconditional edges we can give after which node do we want to route. So here\nwhich node do we want to route. So here\nwhich node do we want to route. So here it is given accepts the name of a node\nit is given accepts the name of a node\nit is given accepts the name of a node and routing function to call after that\nand routing function to call after that\nand routing function to call after that node is executed. So after which node do\nnode is executed. So after which node do\nnode is executed. So after which node do I want the condition conditioning to\nI want the condition conditioning to\nI want the condition conditioning to happen after the assess skill set.\nhappen after the assess skill set.\nhappen after the assess skill set. Right? So that is what we are going to\nRight? So that is what we are going to\nRight? So that is what we are going to do. We are going to do add workflow dot\ndo. We are going to do add workflow dot\ndo. We are going to do add workflow dot add conditional edges and we want to add\nadd conditional edges and we want to add\nadd conditional edges and we want to add the conditional edges after this\nthe conditional edges after this\nthe conditional edges after this assessor skill set. Right? So this is\nassessor skill set. Right? So this is\nassessor skill set. Right? So this is the node after which I want to make the\nthe node after which I want to make the\nthe node after which I want to make the decision. But there has to be a routing\ndecision. But there has to be a routing\ndecision. But there has to be a routing function that needs to be given. Right?\nfunction that needs to be given. Right?\nfunction that needs to be given. Right? And what does this accept? The routing\nAnd what does this accept? The routing\nAnd what does this accept? The routing function accepts the current state of\nfunction accepts the current state of\nfunction accepts the current state of the graph and returns a value just like\nthe graph and returns a value just like\nthe graph and returns a value just like our simple nodes as well. Right? Similar\nour simple nodes as well. Right? Similar\nour simple nodes as well. Right? Similar to nodes. So that's what we need to do.\nto nodes. So that's what we need to do.\nto nodes. So that's what we need to do. We need to write a routing function. So\nWe need to write a routing function. So\nWe need to write a routing function. So we are just going to maybe write route\nwe are just going to maybe write route\nwe are just going to maybe write route app right and we need to write this\napp right and we need to write this\napp right and we need to write this function. So I'm going to call it route\nfunction. So I'm going to call it route\nfunction. So I'm going to call it route app and as it said we need to pass a\napp and as it said we need to pass a\napp and as it said we need to pass a state to it and it is also going to\nstate to it and it is also going to\nstate to it and it is also going to return something. But what is it going\nreturn something. But what is it going\nreturn something. But what is it going to return? Let's look at that. By\nto return? Let's look at that. By\nto return? Let's look at that. By default the return value routing\ndefault the return value routing\ndefault the return value routing function is used as the name of the node\nfunction is used as the name of the node\nfunction is used as the name of the node or the list of the nodes to send the\nor the list of the nodes to send the\nor the list of the nodes to send the state to next. So which is the next node\nstate to next. So which is the next node\nstate to next. So which is the next node to call after this right? So we are\nto call after this right? So we are\nto call after this right? So we are going to give the name of that you can\ngoing to give the name of that you can\ngoing to give the name of that you can also configure it if the names are\nalso configure it if the names are\nalso configure it if the names are different then you can also configure\ndifferent then you can also configure\ndifferent then you can also configure it. Currently I'm going to have the same\nit. Currently I'm going to have the same\nit. Currently I'm going to have the same name. So let's quickly write that code.\nname. So let's quickly write that code.\nname. So let's quickly write that code. So because I have to return a name I'm\nSo because I have to return a name I'm\nSo because I have to return a name I'm basically returning a string itself.\nbasically returning a string itself.\nbasically returning a string itself. Right? So what do I need to check? I\nRight? So what do I need to check? I\nRight? So what do I need to check? I need to check the state of like what\nneed to check the state of like what\nneed to check the state of like what value am I going to check? I'm going to\nvalue am I going to check? I'm going to\nvalue am I going to check? I'm going to check skill match value. Right? That is\ncheck skill match value. Right? That is\ncheck skill match value. Right? That is what I'm returning from here. Right?\nwhat I'm returning from here. Right?\nwhat I'm returning from here. Right? This is skill match. This is basically\nThis is skill match. This is basically\nThis is skill match. This is basically what I'm going to be comparing. Now, if\nwhat I'm going to be comparing. Now, if\nwhat I'm going to be comparing. Now, if skill match is equal to match, see I\nskill match is equal to match, see I\nskill match is equal to match, see I could have obviously written this code\ncould have obviously written this code\ncould have obviously written this code better because here I am doing an exact\nbetter because here I am doing an exact\nbetter because here I am doing an exact match because I'm using open EI. It is\nmatch because I'm using open EI. It is\nmatch because I'm using open EI. It is good enough and it will be able to do\ngood enough and it will be able to do\ngood enough and it will be able to do the exact match. But I have tried this\nthe exact match. But I have tried this\nthe exact match. But I have tried this with say other LLMs. It does not always\nwith say other LLMs. It does not always\nwith say other LLMs. It does not always return this in one word. Okay. So, we\nreturn this in one word. Okay. So, we\nreturn this in one word. Okay. So, we have written respond with either match\nhave written respond with either match\nhave written respond with either match or no match. So sometimes it might\nor no match. So sometimes it might\nor no match. So sometimes it might respond with here is your one-word\nrespond with here is your one-word\nrespond with here is your one-word answer match or no match right. So\nanswer match or no match right. So\nanswer match or no match right. So instead of comparing the exact answer we\ninstead of comparing the exact answer we\ninstead of comparing the exact answer we should be doing contains or something\nshould be doing contains or something\nshould be doing contains or something like that or maybe while assigning we\nlike that or maybe while assigning we\nlike that or maybe while assigning we should be doing that that from the\nshould be doing that that from the\nshould be doing that that from the content I am just taking out the word as\ncontent I am just taking out the word as\ncontent I am just taking out the word as match or no match and assigning that.\nmatch or no match and assigning that.\nmatch or no match and assigning that. Currently I'm keeping the demo as very\nCurrently I'm keeping the demo as very\nCurrently I'm keeping the demo as very simple right. So obviously these things\nsimple right. So obviously these things\nsimple right. So obviously these things can be done. Currently I'm just going to\ncan be done. Currently I'm just going to\ncan be done. Currently I'm just going to so if there is a match what is the next\nso if there is a match what is the next\nso if there is a match what is the next thing that I need to do? I need to oh it\nthing that I need to do? I need to oh it\nthing that I need to do? I need to oh it is actually finishing the function for\nis actually finishing the function for\nis actually finishing the function for me but okay let's write it down okay\nme but okay let's write it down okay\nme but okay let's write it down okay let's see what it is giving so it is\nlet's see what it is giving so it is\nlet's see what it is giving so it is giving if there is a match then I need\ngiving if there is a match then I need\ngiving if there is a match then I need to schedule the HR interview which is\nto schedule the HR interview which is\nto schedule the HR interview which is correct if there is a proper match then\ncorrect if there is a proper match then\ncorrect if there is a proper match then I need to schedule the HR interview else\nI need to schedule the HR interview else\nI need to schedule the HR interview else if only if the experience level is equal\nif only if the experience level is equal\nif only if the experience level is equal to senior level okay only if that is the\nto senior level okay only if that is the\nto senior level okay only if that is the case I'm going to escalate to the\ncase I'm going to escalate to the\ncase I'm going to escalate to the recruiter else I'm going to reject the\nrecruiter else I'm going to reject the\nrecruiter else I'm going to reject the application right? Else I'm going to\napplication right? Else I'm going to\napplication right? Else I'm going to reject the application. So I am\nreject the application. So I am\nreject the application. So I am rejecting in all the other cases like\nrejecting in all the other cases like\nrejecting in all the other cases like for example if it is mid or entry level\nfor example if it is mid or entry level\nfor example if it is mid or entry level I'm going to reject it or if it is not a\nI'm going to reject it or if it is not a\nI'm going to reject it or if it is not a match I'm going to reject it. So in all\nmatch I'm going to reject it. So in all\nmatch I'm going to reject it. So in all the other cases I am rejecting the\nthe other cases I am rejecting the\nthe other cases I am rejecting the application. So this is my\napplication. So this is my\napplication. So this is my route. We are done adding all our nodes\nroute. We are done adding all our nodes\nroute. We are done adding all our nodes and edges. But if you remember the\nand edges. But if you remember the\nand edges. But if you remember the diagram that I showed you in the\ndiagram that I showed you in the\ndiagram that I showed you in the starting there was also something called\nstarting there was also something called\nstarting there was also something called start node and end node. So let's go\nstart node and end node. So let's go\nstart node and end node. So let's go back to the documentation and let's\nback to the documentation and let's\nback to the documentation and let's actually go to the nodes. And here you\nactually go to the nodes. And here you\nactually go to the nodes. And here you can see that add node was the simple\ncan see that add node was the simple\ncan see that add node was the simple thing that we did. We also have\nthing that we did. We also have\nthing that we did. We also have something called start node and end node\nsomething called start node and end node\nsomething called start node and end node which which are nothing but special\nwhich which are nothing but special\nwhich which are nothing but special nodes. So these are already given uh and\nnodes. So these are already given uh and\nnodes. So these are already given uh and we don't need to create them. It is just\nwe don't need to create them. It is just\nwe don't need to create them. It is just that this is how langraph will know that\nthat this is how langraph will know that\nthat this is how langraph will know that this is where I need to start from and\nthis is where I need to start from and\nthis is where I need to start from and this is my terminal node. So this is\nthis is my terminal node. So this is\nthis is my terminal node. So this is where I need to end. Right? So I just\nwhere I need to end. Right? So I just\nwhere I need to end. Right? So I just need to add these edges. So from the\nneed to add these edges. So from the\nneed to add these edges. So from the start node and till the end node. Right?\nstart node and till the end node. Right?\nstart node and till the end node. Right? So let's just quickly do that.\nSo, so what was our starting point? A\nSo, so what was our starting point? A starting point was basically categorize\nstarting point was basically categorize\nstarting point was basically categorize experience, right? So, I need to add\nexperience, right? So, I need to add\nexperience, right? So, I need to add edge from\nedge from\nedge from start till over here, right? And for\nstart till over here, right? And for\nstart till over here, right? And for this, I need to import the start and the\nthis, I need to import the start and the\nthis, I need to import the start and the end from the langraph. This is not\nend from the langraph. This is not\nend from the langraph. This is not there, right? And by the way, if you\nthere, right? And by the way, if you\nthere, right? And by the way, if you ever get stuck, you can also always do\never get stuck, you can also always do\never get stuck, you can also always do explain in Google Collab. It is very,\nexplain in Google Collab. It is very,\nexplain in Google Collab. It is very, very helpful. It just tells you that you\nvery helpful. It just tells you that you\nvery helpful. It just tells you that you need to import. So I'm going to go up.\nneed to import. So I'm going to go up.\nneed to import. So I'm going to go up. So where I imported state graph there\nSo where I imported state graph there\nSo where I imported state graph there I'm going to import start and end.\nI'm going to import start and end.\nI'm going to import start and end. That's\nThat's\nThat's it. And we are going\nit. And we are going\nit. And we are going to come back and let me just quickly add\nto come back and let me just quickly add\nto come back and let me just quickly add the other edges as\nthe other edges as\nthe other edges as well. And we are going to add to the\nwell. And we are going to add to the\nwell. And we are going to add to the end. Oh so it is giving me autocomplete.\nend. Oh so it is giving me autocomplete.\nend. Oh so it is giving me autocomplete. So from all the other ones SS skill set,\nSo from all the other ones SS skill set,\nSo from all the other ones SS skill set, escalate to recruiter, reject\nescalate to recruiter, reject\nescalate to recruiter, reject application, schedule. So we are just\napplication, schedule. So we are just\napplication, schedule. So we are just going to add the end edges right. So\ngoing to add the end edges right. So\ngoing to add the end edges right. So that's it. Now we are actually done\nthat's it. Now we are actually done\nthat's it. Now we are actually done adding all the nodes adding all the\nadding all the nodes adding all the\nadding all the nodes adding all the edges. What we need to do now is\nedges. What we need to do now is\nedges. What we need to do now is compile. So actually I think I saw\ncompile. So actually I think I saw\ncompile. So actually I think I saw somewhere in caps it was given that we\nsomewhere in caps it was given that we\nsomewhere in caps it was given that we must compile. So let me actually search\nit. So here you can see it is given you\nit. So here you can see it is given you must compile your graph before you can\nmust compile your graph before you can\nmust compile your graph before you can use it. Right? So we need to compile a\nuse it. Right? So we need to compile a\nuse it. Right? So we need to compile a graph something like this graph builder\ngraph something like this graph builder\ngraph something like this graph builder dot compile right. So maybe we can call\ndot compile right. So maybe we can call\ndot compile right. So maybe we can call it our app. That is what we are going to\nit our app. That is what we are going to\nit our app. That is what we are going to get from our workflow. So after\nget from our workflow. So after\nget from our workflow. So after compiling the workflow we will have an\ncompiling the workflow we will have an\ncompiling the workflow we will have an app and we are ready to use it. Okay.\napp and we are ready to use it. Okay.\napp and we are ready to use it. Okay. Okay. I know why this is happening\nOkay. I know why this is happening\nOkay. I know why this is happening because I just ran this again. So it\nbecause I just ran this again. So it\nbecause I just ran this again. So it created basically the workflow from the\ncreated basically the workflow from the\ncreated basically the workflow from the starting. So let's just quickly restart\nstarting. So let's just quickly restart\nstarting. So let's just quickly restart the session and let me just run all of\nthe session and let me just run all of\nthe session and let me just run all of this once more because I created the\nthis once more because I created the\nthis once more because I created the workflow again. So it does not have\nworkflow again. So it does not have\nworkflow again. So it does not have these nodes and we are going to run into\nthese nodes and we are going to run into\nthese nodes and we are going to run into problems. So instead of that let me just\nproblems. So instead of that let me just\nproblems. So instead of that let me just write the code properly and just rerun\nwrite the code properly and just rerun\nwrite the code properly and just rerun the entire thing. And I'm going to\nthe entire thing. And I'm going to\nthe entire thing. And I'm going to remove this and let me just add it over\nremove this and let me just add it over\nremove this and let me just add it over here and let me try running it\nhere and let me try running it\nhere and let me try running it again. I could also run all these cells.\nagain. I could also run all these cells.\nagain. I could also run all these cells. So I could also go over here restart\nSo I could also go over here restart\nSo I could also go over here restart session and run all but just to show you\nsession and run all but just to show you\nsession and run all but just to show you quickly we're going to do it. So I have\nquickly we're going to do it. So I have\nquickly we're going to do it. So I have restarted going to set the open AI keys.\nrestarted going to set the open AI keys.\nrestarted going to set the open AI keys. This will be also a good revision. We\nThis will be also a good revision. We\nThis will be also a good revision. We created the\ncreated the\ncreated the LLM. So whenever we need to form the\nLLM. So whenever we need to form the\nLLM. So whenever we need to form the state graph the first thing that we need\nstate graph the first thing that we need\nstate graph the first thing that we need to do is define the state. The next\nto do is define the state. The next\nto do is define the state. The next thing that we need to do is define the\nthing that we need to do is define the\nthing that we need to do is define the state graph. Then we added all the\nstate graph. Then we added all the\nstate graph. Then we added all the functions corresponding to our nodes. We\nfunctions corresponding to our nodes. We\nfunctions corresponding to our nodes. We added our nodes. Then we added the\nadded our nodes. Then we added the\nadded our nodes. Then we added the routing function. And we added our edge\nrouting function. And we added our edge\nrouting function. And we added our edge the conditional edges. We added the\nthe conditional edges. We added the\nthe conditional edges. We added the start and the end edges. And then we\nstart and the end edges. And then we\nstart and the end edges. And then we compiled. So it is compiling now.\nGreat. Now that we have compiled our\nGreat. Now that we have compiled our graph, we are actually ready to run it.\ngraph, we are actually ready to run it.\ngraph, we are actually ready to run it. But if you also want to visualize it,\nBut if you also want to visualize it,\nBut if you also want to visualize it, you're also ready to visualize it. So\nyou're also ready to visualize it. So\nyou're also ready to visualize it. So let me actually search and show you how\nlet me actually search and show you how\nlet me actually search and show you how to visualize. So if you just go over\nto visualize. So if you just go over\nto visualize. So if you just go over here, let's go down. So here they have\nhere, let's go down. So here they have\nhere, let's go down. So here they have given this code. Let's just copy paste\ngiven this code. Let's just copy paste\ngiven this code. Let's just copy paste this and let me show it to you.\nthis and let me show it to you.\nthis and let me show it to you. So this is basically for some\nSo this is basically for some\nSo this is basically for some configurations we don't need this. All\nconfigurations we don't need this. All\nconfigurations we don't need this. All I'm doing is basically drawing the graph\nI'm doing is basically drawing the graph\nI'm doing is basically drawing the graph in PNG format. So here you can see\nin PNG format. So here you can see\nin PNG format. So here you can see right. So if I run\nthis, it took some time but here it is\nthis, it took some time but here it is our beautiful graph. So congratulations.\nour beautiful graph. So congratulations.\nour beautiful graph. So congratulations. Let's just go through this once more. So\nLet's just go through this once more. So\nLet's just go through this once more. So this was the first node that we added\nthis was the first node that we added\nthis was the first node that we added categorize experience. Then we added\ncategorize experience. Then we added\ncategorize experience. Then we added these nodes. We added this conditional\nthese nodes. We added this conditional\nthese nodes. We added this conditional edges, right? We started from start, we\nedges, right? We started from start, we\nedges, right? We started from start, we ended at end. So this is how our graph\nended at end. So this is how our graph\nended at end. So this is how our graph looks like. Let's put it to test now.\nlooks like. Let's put it to test now.\nlooks like. Let's put it to test now. Right? So we have the app. Now we need\nRight? So we have the app. Now we need\nRight? So we have the app. Now we need to invoke it and we need to see the\nto invoke it and we need to see the\nto invoke it and we need to see the results whether it is actually working\nresults whether it is actually working\nresults whether it is actually working or not. Right? So we will actually be\nor not. Right? So we will actually be\nor not. Right? So we will actually be making the calls to LLM and let's see if\nmaking the calls to LLM and let's see if\nmaking the calls to LLM and let's see if we are able to actually see this. So we\nwe are able to actually see this. So we\nwe are able to actually see this. So we I'm going to just write a simple\nI'm going to just write a simple\nI'm going to just write a simple function uh maybe run candidate\nfunction uh maybe run candidate\nfunction uh maybe run candidate screening and we are going to pass the\nscreening and we are going to pass the\nscreening and we are going to pass the application in this particular function\napplication in this particular function\napplication in this particular function which is going to be nothing but a\nwhich is going to be nothing but a\nwhich is going to be nothing but a string for now. It could also be a PDF\nstring for now. It could also be a PDF\nstring for now. It could also be a PDF which you're going to read and then\nwhich you're going to read and then\nwhich you're going to read and then probably you can assess that as well. So\nprobably you can assess that as well. So\nprobably you can assess that as well. So there are a lot of things that you can\nthere are a lot of things that you can\nthere are a lot of things that you can do but for now keeping things simple\ndo but for now keeping things simple\ndo but for now keeping things simple suppose we're getting an application in\nsuppose we're getting an application in\nsuppose we're getting an application in the string form then we are going to get\nthe string form then we are going to get\nthe string form then we are going to get the results by invoking our app. So I'm\nthe results by invoking our app. So I'm\nthe results by invoking our app. So I'm just going to do app.invoke invoke and I\njust going to do app.invoke invoke and I\njust going to do app.invoke invoke and I am going to pass the application as the\nam going to pass the application as the\nam going to pass the application as the dictionary and I'm going to whatever\ndictionary and I'm going to whatever\ndictionary and I'm going to whatever response I'm going to get I'm going to\nresponse I'm going to get I'm going to\nresponse I'm going to get I'm going to print it right but instead of print for\nprint it right but instead of print for\nprint it right but instead of print for now just let's return the whole thing\nnow just let's return the whole thing\nnow just let's return the whole thing right because I'm going to print that as\nright because I'm going to print that as\nright because I'm going to print that as well so let's just let me write it\nwell so let's just let me write it\nwell so let's just let me write it properly I know this is kind of\nproperly I know this is kind of\nproperly I know this is kind of redundant but this is for clarity\nOkay. So whatever we are getting it in\nOkay. So whatever we are getting it in the response, we are just returning that\nthe response, we are just returning that\nthe response, we are just returning that itself as the\nitself as the\nitself as the dictionary. So this is my function. I\ndictionary. So this is my function. I\ndictionary. So this is my function. I obviously need to call it. Let's take\nobviously need to call it. Let's take\nobviously need to call it. Let's take one example application text. This could\none example application text. This could\none example application text. This could be anything. See currently the code that\nbe anything. See currently the code that\nbe anything. See currently the code that I have written is that we are checking\nI have written is that we are checking\nI have written is that we are checking for Python job role. Right? Let's maybe\nfor Python job role. Right? Let's maybe\nfor Python job role. Right? Let's maybe pass for one Java role and let's see the\npass for one Java role and let's see the\npass for one Java role and let's see the application. Suppose I'm sending that I\napplication. Suppose I'm sending that I\napplication. Suppose I'm sending that I have experience in Java and I have\nhave experience in Java and I have\nhave experience in Java and I have experience in Python. Let's see what is\nexperience in Python. Let's see what is\nexperience in Python. Let's see what is the response and let's see if our LM is\nthe response and let's see if our LM is\nthe response and let's see if our LM is able to distinguish or not. So if I have\nable to distinguish or not. So if I have\nable to distinguish or not. So if I have 10 years of\n10 years of\n10 years of experience in software\nexperience in software\nexperience in software engineering with expertise in Java.\nengineering with expertise in Java.\nengineering with expertise in Java. Okay. So if I write this and if I try to\nOkay. So if I write this and if I try to\nOkay. So if I write this and if I try to get the results from my app. So I just\nget the results from my app. So I just\nget the results from my app. So I just need to call this function. I need to\nneed to call this function. I need to\nneed to call this function. I need to pass the application. So I'm going to\npass the application. So I'm going to\npass the application. So I'm going to pass the application\ntext and whatever are the results I'm\ntext and whatever are the results I'm quickly going to print it as well. I\nquickly going to print it as well. I\nquickly going to print it as well. I know I could have just printed over\nknow I could have just printed over\nknow I could have just printed over there but just printing it properly\nagain. So whatever the results I'm just\nagain. So whatever the results I'm just going to print them again quickly.\ngoing to print them again quickly.\ngoing to print them again quickly. And let's just try running this and\nAnd let's just try running this and\nAnd let's just try running this and let's see if it works or not. So\nlet's see if it works or not. So\nlet's see if it works or not. So categorizing the experience level of\ncategorizing the experience level of\ncategorizing the experience level of candidate as senior level. So 10 years\ncandidate as senior level. So 10 years\ncandidate as senior level. So 10 years it thought if as senior level assessing\nit thought if as senior level assessing\nit thought if as senior level assessing the match it assessed it and it was able\nthe match it assessed it and it was able\nthe match it assessed it and it was able to say that there is no match because we\nto say that there is no match because we\nto say that there is no match because we said in Java and it had what it had in\nsaid in Java and it had what it had in\nsaid in Java and it had what it had in Python. The job role that was expected\nPython. The job role that was expected\nPython. The job role that was expected the job description was in Python right\nthe job description was in Python right\nthe job description was in Python right because it was a senior level person so\nbecause it was a senior level person so\nbecause it was a senior level person so it escalated to recruiter. Right? if it\nit escalated to recruiter. Right? if it\nit escalated to recruiter. Right? if it was mid-level or if it was entry level,\nwas mid-level or if it was entry level,\nwas mid-level or if it was entry level, it would not have uh done that. Let's\nit would not have uh done that. Let's\nit would not have uh done that. Let's actually check it out. And I've just\nactually check it out. And I've just\nactually check it out. And I've just printed the same thing again. So these\nprinted the same thing again. So these\nprinted the same thing again. So these are the print statements that we added\nare the print statements that we added\nare the print statements that we added in the nodes. And this is the final\nin the nodes. And this is the final\nin the nodes. And this is the final computed result. So if I have one years\ncomputed result. So if I have one years\ncomputed result. So if I have one years of experience and suppose in Java\nof experience and suppose in Java\nof experience and suppose in Java itself, let's see what's going to\nitself, let's see what's going to\nitself, let's see what's going to happen. So because I I have only one\nhappen. So because I I have only one\nhappen. So because I I have only one year of experience, I am now entry\nyear of experience, I am now entry\nyear of experience, I am now entry level. The candidate is entry level. And\nlevel. The candidate is entry level. And\nlevel. The candidate is entry level. And because there is no match, we just\nbecause there is no match, we just\nbecause there is no match, we just rejected, right? So we send the\nrejected, right? So we send the\nrejected, right? So we send the rejection mail. See here because there\nrejection mail. See here because there\nrejection mail. See here because there was a senior person we had escalated to\nwas a senior person we had escalated to\nwas a senior person we had escalated to recruiter because now there is one year\nrecruiter because now there is one year\nrecruiter because now there is one year of experience we are sending the\nof experience we are sending the\nof experience we are sending the rejection mail let's try more suppose I\nrejection mail let's try more suppose I\nrejection mail let's try more suppose I have any years of experience okay so\nhave any years of experience okay so\nhave any years of experience okay so suppose I have no experience I have\nsuppose I have no experience I have\nsuppose I have no experience I have experience in software engineering in\nexperience in software engineering in\nexperience in software engineering in Python let's see what's going to\nhappen so it by default set it to midle\nhappen so it by default set it to midle and it set a m match and it scheduled\nand it set a m match and it scheduled\nand it set a m match and it scheduled the interview correct So let's try maybe\nthe interview correct So let's try maybe\nthe interview correct So let's try maybe a bit more. Let's try for C++. Suppose I\na bit more. Let's try for C++. Suppose I\na bit more. Let's try for C++. Suppose I have uh 5 years of experience in\nhave uh 5 years of experience in\nhave uh 5 years of experience in C++ and let's see what's going to happen\nC++ and let's see what's going to happen\nC++ and let's see what's going to happen now. So again midle there's no match. So\nnow. So again midle there's no match. So\nnow. So again midle there's no match. So send the rejection made right.\nsend the rejection made right.\nsend the rejection made right. Beautiful. So this is working nicely. I\nBeautiful. So this is working nicely. I\nBeautiful. So this is working nicely. I hope you are enjoying it. And this\nhope you are enjoying it. And this\nhope you are enjoying it. And this brings us to the end of the video.

So here step by step what you're doing is you\nstep by step what you're doing is you\nstep by step what you're doing is you are first retrieving the documents then\nare first retrieving the documents then\nare first retrieving the documents then you're splitting it into chunks to take\nyou're splitting it into chunks to take\nyou're splitting it into chunks to take care of the context window for llm then\ncare of the context window for llm then\ncare of the context window for llm then you store it in vector database for\nyou store it in vector database for\nyou store it in vector database for semantic search later on then you\nsemantic search later on then you\nsemantic search later on then you retrieve and call llm and so on. Now you\nretrieve and call llm and so on. Now you\nretrieve and call llm and so on. Now you can do all of this in Python but lang\ncan do all of this in Python but lang\ncan do all of this in Python but lang chain is a beautiful framework that\nchain is a beautiful framework that\nchain is a beautiful framework that makes these things easier by providing\nmakes these things easier by providing\nmakes these things easier by providing readymade classes.

These are all the classes from lang chain library. If you\nclasses from lang chain library. If you\nclasses from lang chain library. If you categorize LLM powered application into\ncategorize LLM powered application into\ncategorize LLM powered application into two groups then those two groups uh as\ntwo groups then those two groups uh as\ntwo groups then those two groups uh as per anthropics building effective agent\nper anthropics building effective agent\nper anthropics building effective agent guide are workflows and agents.\nguide are workflows and agents.\nguide are workflows and agents. Workflows is basically a software where\nWorkflows is basically a software where\nWorkflows is basically a software where one of the component is LLM and\none of the component is LLM and\none of the component is LLM and remaining things are joined by a\nremaining things are joined by a\nremaining things are joined by a predefined core path just like any usual\npredefined core path just like any usual\npredefined core path just like any usual software. So let's say you might be\nsoftware. So let's say you might be\nsoftware. So let's say you might be loading data from somewhere. Then you're\nloading data from somewhere. Then you're\nloading data from somewhere. Then you're doing some pre-processing and then you\ndoing some pre-processing and then you\ndoing some pre-processing and then you use LLM let's say to extract information\nuse LLM let's say to extract information\nuse LLM let's say to extract information out of that text or to do something\nout of that text or to do something\nout of that text or to do something else. Okay. Then you have one other\nelse. Okay. Then you have one other\nelse. Okay. Then you have one other step. Then you might have another LLM\nstep. Then you might have another LLM\nstep. Then you might have another LLM call. So this is like a usual software.\ncall. So this is like a usual software.\ncall. So this is like a usual software. It is just that LLM is one or more\nIt is just that LLM is one or more\nIt is just that LLM is one or more component in in that software ecosystem.\ncomponent in in that software ecosystem.\ncomponent in in that software ecosystem. This kind of uh thing is called chain\nThis kind of uh thing is called chain\nThis kind of uh thing is called chain and lang chain is a framework that makes\nand lang chain is a framework that makes\nand lang chain is a framework that makes building llm powered application easy.\nbuilding llm powered application easy.\nbuilding llm powered application easy. Especially it is used mainly to build\nEspecially it is used mainly to build\nEspecially it is used mainly to build straightforward chains whatever we saw.\nstraightforward chains whatever we saw.\nstraightforward chains whatever we saw. So there are steps that you follow to\nSo there are steps that you follow to\nSo there are steps that you follow to build your application and one of the\nbuild your application and one of the\nbuild your application and one of the step is LLM. So here LLM is not making\nstep is LLM. So here LLM is not making\nstep is LLM. So here LLM is not making any autonomous decision. It is given a\nany autonomous decision.

It is given a predefined task that okay from this text\npredefined task that okay from this text\npredefined task that okay from this text extract this information or summarize\nextract this information or summarize\nextract this information or summarize this information and remaining thing is\nthis information and remaining thing is\nthis information and remaining thing is all your Python or whatever programming\nall your Python or whatever programming\nall your Python or whatever programming language you're using is just code.\nlanguage you're using is just code.\nlanguage you're using is just code. Okay. Now let's say you want to build a\nOkay. Now let's say you want to build a\nOkay. Now let's say you want to build a complex chatboard where customer is\ncomplex chatboard where customer is\ncomplex chatboard where customer is asking I want to exchange my t-shirt for\nasking I want to exchange my t-shirt for\nasking I want to exchange my t-shirt for a different item and you will then ask\na different item and you will then ask\na different item and you will then ask for order ID. Right? This is not\nfor order ID. Right? This is not\nfor order ID. Right? This is not something you can just answer in one\nsomething you can just answer in one\nsomething you can just answer in one shot. Then they will provide order ID.\nshot. Then they will provide order ID.\nshot. Then they will provide order ID. Now you'll say okay now with which item\nNow you'll say okay now with which item\nNow you'll say okay now with which item you want to replace. So they provide SKU\nyou want to replace. So they provide SKU\nyou want to replace. So they provide SKU and there is some interaction there is\nand there is some interaction there is\nand there is some interaction there is some kind of a multi-turn approach here\nsome kind of a multi-turn approach here\nsome kind of a multi-turn approach here to summarize the steps you have to check\nto summarize the steps you have to check\nto summarize the steps you have to check first the refund policy for the item\nfirst the refund policy for the item\nfirst the refund policy for the item that they are returning then you check\nthat they are returning then you check\nthat they are returning then you check order details in the database to make\norder details in the database to make\norder details in the database to make sure that you know uh the item is\nsure that you know uh the item is\nsure that you know uh the item is eligible and what was the price and so\neligible and what was the price and so\neligible and what was the price and so on. Then you check availability of the\non. Then you check availability of the\non. Then you check availability of the new item order new item print shipping\nnew item order new item print shipping\nnew item order new item print shipping label for old item. So this is not like\nlabel for old item. So this is not like\nlabel for old item. So this is not like a simple question okay what is my refund\na simple question okay what is my refund\na simple question okay what is my refund policy 30 days this requires multiple\npolicy 30 days this requires multiple\npolicy 30 days this requires multiple steps multiple clarification it's a\nsteps multiple clarification it's a\nsteps multiple clarification it's a complex flow and in each of the flow for\ncomplex flow and in each of the flow for\ncomplex flow and in each of the flow for refund policy you might have to access\nrefund policy you might have to access\nrefund policy you might have to access your policy documents for checking order\nyour policy documents for checking order\nyour policy documents for checking order details you might have to hit some\ndetails you might have to hit some\ndetails you might have to hit some database for checking availability of a\ndatabase for checking availability of a\ndatabase for checking availability of a new item you might be calling some\nnew item you might be calling some\nnew item you might be calling some micros service some API and to print\nmicros service some API and to print\nmicros service some API and to print label or you might be using some other\nlabel or you might be using some other\nlabel or you might be using some other software and in each of these steps LLM\nsoftware and in each of these steps LLM\nsoftware and in each of these steps LLM will be involved Okay. So, LLM either in\nwill be involved Okay. So, LLM either in\nwill be involved Okay. So, LLM either in all the steps or some of the steps LLM\nall the steps or some of the steps LLM\nall the steps or some of the steps LLM will be there and along with LLM you\nwill be there and along with LLM you\nwill be there and along with LLM you have documents, database, API etc. which\nhave documents, database, API etc. which\nhave documents, database, API etc. which will help you perform all these task.\nwill help you perform all these task.\nwill help you perform all these task. So, you are essentially doing goal\nSo, you are essentially doing goal\nSo, you are essentially doing goal oriented planning for a return that\noriented planning for a return that\noriented planning for a return that customer want to perform in the exchange\ncustomer want to perform in the exchange\ncustomer want to perform in the exchange of a new item. You first figure out all\nof a new item. You first figure out all\nof a new item. You first figure out all these four steps. Then you do multi-step\nthese four steps. Then you do multi-step\nthese four steps. Then you do multi-step reasoning, multi-step planning. You\nreasoning, multi-step planning. You\nreasoning, multi-step planning. You perform these steps uh one by one. Now\nperform these steps uh one by one. Now\nperform these steps uh one by one. Now let's say some of the steps might fail.\nlet's say some of the steps might fail.\nlet's say some of the steps might fail. Okay. So check the availability of new\nOkay. So check the availability of new\nOkay. So check the availability of new item. Let's say it fails. You might have\nitem. Let's say it fails. You might have\nitem. Let's say it fails. You might have to hit different API different color\nto hit different API different color\nto hit different API different color something something like that. You know\nsomething something like that. You know\nsomething something like that. You know then you have access to tools, right?\nthen you have access to tools, right?\nthen you have access to tools, right? These are tools. Knowledge knowledge is\nThese are tools. Knowledge knowledge is\nThese are tools. Knowledge knowledge is all PDF and database knowledge API etc.\nall PDF and database knowledge API etc.\nall PDF and database knowledge API etc. are called tools. All right. So this is\nare called tools. All right. So this is\nare called tools. All right. So this is an agentic chatboard. Agentic chatboard\nan agentic chatboard. Agentic chatboard\nan agentic chatboard. Agentic chatboard works on a complex task. It will divide\nworks on a complex task. It will divide\nworks on a complex task. It will divide it into multiple subtask. Then it will\nit into multiple subtask. Then it will\nit into multiple subtask. Then it will perform them one by one. Let's say\nperform them one by one. Let's say\nperform them one by one. Let's say second step fails. It will retry it.\nsecond step fails. It will retry it.\nsecond step fails. It will retry it. Okay. So there is a component of retry,\nOkay. So there is a component of retry,\nOkay. So there is a component of retry, feedback, etc. Just like how as humans\nfeedback, etc. Just like how as humans\nfeedback, etc. Just like how as humans we do the work. Let's say you are doing\nwe do the work. Let's say you are doing\nwe do the work. Let's say you are doing coding. You run the code, you find an\ncoding. You run the code, you find an\ncoding. You run the code, you find an error, then you fix the error, you know,\nerror, then you fix the error, you know,\nerror, then you fix the error, you know, you again run the code, then you find\nyou again run the code, then you find\nyou again run the code, then you find let's say another issue, then you fix\nlet's say another issue, then you fix\nlet's say another issue, then you fix that. So it's iterative approach.\nthat. So it's iterative approach.\nthat. So it's iterative approach. Agentic chatboard has some kind of\nAgentic chatboard has some kind of\nAgentic chatboard has some kind of autonomy and it will do this kind of\nautonomy and it will do this kind of\nautonomy and it will do this kind of multi-step iterative approach to\nmulti-step iterative approach to\nmulti-step iterative approach to accomplish a goal. Now one of the\naccomplish a goal. Now one of the\naccomplish a goal. Now one of the popular design for building agentic\npopular design for building agentic\npopular design for building agentic application is graph based stateful\napplication is graph based stateful\napplication is graph based stateful workflow. What I mean by that is let's\nworkflow. What I mean by that is let's\nworkflow. What I mean by that is let's say you start somewhere and you are\nsay you start somewhere and you are\nsay you start somewhere and you are making an LLM call. Okay. And then LLM\nmaking an LLM call. Okay. And then LLM\nmaking an LLM call. Okay. And then LLM will decide what to do as a next step.\nwill decide what to do as a next step.\nwill decide what to do as a next step. So let's say there is some conditional\nSo let's say there is some conditional\nSo let's say there is some conditional logic and LLM might decide to perform\nlogic and LLM might decide to perform\nlogic and LLM might decide to perform step A or step B or it might decide to\nstep A or step B or it might decide to\nstep A or step B or it might decide to make another call to a different LLM and\nmake another call to a different LLM and\nmake another call to a different LLM and same way when you're here this LLM can\nsame way when you're here this LLM can\nsame way when you're here this LLM can also autonomously I mean there will be\nalso autonomously I mean there will be\nalso autonomously I mean there will be some kind of prompt that will be given\nsome kind of prompt that will be given\nsome kind of prompt that will be given but the actual decision is made by this\nbut the actual decision is made by this\nbut the actual decision is made by this LLM in autonomous way it can perform\nLLM in autonomous way it can perform\nLLM in autonomous way it can perform either step C D E etc or it can actually\neither step C D E etc or it can actually\neither step C D E etc or it can actually call back to the original LLM. So there\ncall back to the original LLM. So there\ncall back to the original LLM. So there are four possible core paths. So this is\nare four possible core paths. So this is\nare four possible core paths. So this is a stateful workflow represented as a\na stateful workflow represented as a\na stateful workflow represented as a graph and langraph is a framework to\ngraph and langraph is a framework to\ngraph and langraph is a framework to orchestrate multi-step\norchestrate multi-step\norchestrate multi-step stateful workflows using graph-based\nstateful workflows using graph-based\nstateful workflows using graph-based structure. Here I'm showing you a code\nstructure. Here I'm showing you a code\nstructure. Here I'm showing you a code of\nof\nof one of the graphs we built in in\none of the graphs we built in in\none of the graphs we built in in Langraph. So you import all these\nLangraph. So you import all these\nLangraph. So you import all these libraries. Okay. And then uh you have a\nlibraries. Okay. And then uh you have a\nlibraries. Okay. And then uh you have a this tool. So tool is a dummy python\nthis tool. So tool is a dummy python\nthis tool. So tool is a dummy python tool. It just gets the latest price of\ntool. It just gets the latest price of\ntool. It just gets the latest price of any stock Microsoft, Apple etc. And then\nany stock Microsoft, Apple etc. And then\nany stock Microsoft, Apple etc. And then uh you design the graph like this. So if\nuh you design the graph like this. So if\nuh you design the graph like this. So if I show you the graph is nothing but you\nI show you the graph is nothing but you\nI show you the graph is nothing but you start then there's a chatboard and as a\nstart then there's a chatboard and as a\nstart then there's a chatboard and as a tool you have that function the you know\ntool you have that function the you know\ntool you have that function the you know get stock price function. Okay. So when\nget stock price function. Okay. So when\nget stock price function. Okay. So when you perform all these steps eventually\nyou perform all these steps eventually\nyou perform all these steps eventually when you say I want to buy 20 Amazon\nwhen you say I want to buy 20 Amazon\nwhen you say I want to buy 20 Amazon stocks it will be able to call that\nstocks it will be able to call that\nstocks it will be able to call that function get the price and then you know\nfunction get the price and then you know\nfunction get the price and then you know it's performing those steps to kind of\nit's performing those steps to kind of\nit's performing those steps to kind of call the tool multiple times and then\ncall the tool multiple times and then\ncall the tool multiple times and then give you a total amount for your entire\ngive you a total amount for your entire\ngive you a total amount for your entire stock transaction. If you want to learn\nstock transaction. If you want to learn\nstock transaction. If you want to learn lang graph in detail then I have this uh\nlang graph in detail then I have this uh\nlang graph in detail then I have this uh tutorial. It's like more than 1 hour\ntutorial. It's like more than 1 hour\ntutorial. It's like more than 1 hour tutorial which will walk you through the\ntutorial which will walk you through the\ntutorial which will walk you through the entire framework from the very\nentire framework from the very\nentire framework from the very beginning. Let's summarize the\nbeginning. Let's summarize the\nbeginning. Let's summarize the difference between these two. So lang\ndifference between these two. So lang\ndifference between these two. So lang chain is a toolkit that allows you to\nchain is a toolkit that allows you to\nchain is a toolkit that allows you to build llm apps chains tools agents.\nbuild llm apps chains tools agents.\nbuild llm apps chains tools agents. Whereas lang graph is a framework that\nWhereas lang graph is a framework that\nWhereas lang graph is a framework that is used mainly for agent. So just\nis used mainly for agent. So just\nis used mainly for agent. So just remember if you are writing a simple\nremember if you are writing a simple\nremember if you are writing a simple linear workflows you use lang chain but\nlinear workflows you use lang chain but\nlinear workflows you use lang chain but if you want to build complex agents use\nif you want to build complex agents use\nif you want to build complex agents use lang graph. style for lang chain is\nlang graph. style for lang chain is\nlang graph. style for lang chain is linear and reactive. Reactive means like\nlinear and reactive. Reactive means like\nlinear and reactive. Reactive means like you give some task it will return the\nyou give some task it will return the\nyou give some task it will return the response okay input output whereas lang\nresponse okay input output whereas lang\nresponse okay input output whereas lang graph has a graph base supports it\ngraph has a graph base supports it\ngraph has a graph base supports it supports loops retries you know it will\nsupports loops retries you know it will\nsupports loops retries you know it will retry to fix the error and kind of get\nretry to fix the error and kind of get\nretry to fix the error and kind of get the thing done it also has a memory base\nthe thing done it also has a memory base\nthe thing done it also has a memory base use case for lang chain is simple\nuse case for lang chain is simple\nuse case for lang chain is simple chatboard rag etc lang graph is as I\nchatboard rag etc lang graph is as I\nchatboard rag etc lang graph is as I said multi-step workflows complex agents\nsaid multi-step workflows complex agents\nsaid multi-step workflows complex agents and lang chain is partially stateful\nand lang chain is partially stateful\nand lang chain is partially stateful where lang graph has a state in that\nwhere lang graph has a state in that\nwhere lang graph has a state in that graph. So if you refer to my lang graph\ngraph. So if you refer to my lang graph\ngraph. So if you refer to my lang graph tutorial, you will get better\ntutorial, you will get better\ntutorial, you will get better understanding just in case if you don't\nunderstanding just in case if you don't\nunderstanding just in case if you don't know about graphs and states. Uh and\nknow about graphs and states. Uh and\nknow about graphs and states. Uh and here are the example use cases. Now what\nhere are the example use cases. Now what\nhere are the example use cases. Now what is lang? Well, lang is a debugging and\nis lang? Well, lang is a debugging and\nis lang? Well, lang is a debugging and observability platform folks. So if you\nobservability platform folks. So if you\nobservability platform folks. So if you look at the architecture,\nlook at the architecture,\nlook at the architecture, see this is an entire like ecosystem\nsee this is an entire like ecosystem\nsee this is an entire like ecosystem where you have lang and langraph they\nwhere you have lang and langraph they\nwhere you have lang and langraph they both are open source. Okay. Then you\nboth are open source. Okay. Then you\nboth are open source. Okay. Then you have langsmith which is uh doing the\nhave langsmith which is uh doing the\nhave langsmith which is uh doing the work of debugging playground prompt\nwork of debugging playground prompt\nwork of debugging playground prompt management monitoring you know so let's\nmanagement monitoring you know so let's\nmanagement monitoring you know so let's say if you deploy the aentki system in\nsay if you deploy the aentki system in\nsay if you deploy the aentki system in the production you want to monitor\nthe production you want to monitor\nthe production you want to monitor whether it's performing well you want to\nwhether it's performing well you want to\nwhether it's performing well you want to monitor your token cost okay it's not\nmonitor your token cost okay it's not\nmonitor your token cost okay it's not like you're spending millions of dollars\nlike you're spending millions of dollars\nlike you're spending millions of dollars in your token cost so all of those\nin your token cost so all of those\nin your token cost so all of those failures evaluation all of those things\nfailures evaluation all of those things\nfailures evaluation all of those things are done through langmmith so here is a\nare done through langmmith so here is a\nare done through langmmith so here is a lang UI where there's this demo demo app\nlang UI where there's this demo demo app\nlang UI where there's this demo demo app and really here you can see all the\nand really here you can see all the\nand really here you can see all the individual calls right you called vector\nindividual calls right you called vector\nindividual calls right you called vector database then you called chat GPT okay\ndatabase then you called chat GPT okay\ndatabase then you called chat GPT okay what was the input what was the output\nwhat was the input what was the output\nwhat was the input what was the output how many tokens did you use 390 what was\nhow many tokens did you use 390 what was\nhow many tokens did you use 390 what was the latency so you can monitor all of\nthe latency so you can monitor all of\nthe latency so you can monitor all of that this is just tracing but you can do\nthat this is just tracing but you can do\nthat this is just tracing but you can do much more than this if you want to learn\nmuch more than this if you want to learn\nmuch more than this if you want to learn these things in detail once again I have\nthese things in detail once again I have\nthese things in detail once again I have complete tutorials if you have any\ncomplete tutorials if you have any\ncomplete tutorials if you have any questions please post in the comment box\nquestions please post in the comment box\nquestions please post in the comment box below I hope you got some understanding\nbelow I hope you got some understanding\nbelow I hope you got some understanding of lang lang graph and Lang Smith.

In this video, I will make an attempt to\nthis video, I will make an attempt to\nthis video, I will make an attempt to give a very simple explanation of the\ngive a very simple explanation of the\ngive a very simple explanation of the difference between these three. So let's\ndifference between these three. So let's\ndifference between these three. So let's start with the basics. When you take any\nstart with the basics. When you take any\nstart with the basics.

So if\nsome huge volume of internet data. So if\nsome huge volume of internet data. So if you ask a general question like this, it\nyou ask a general question like this, it\nyou ask a general question like this, it will be able to answer. But let's say\nwill be able to answer. But let's say\nwill be able to answer. But let's say you have this clothing store called\nyou have this clothing store called\nyou have this clothing store called Surma E-commerce for which you're\nSurma E-commerce for which you're\nSurma E-commerce for which you're building a chatboard which is powered by\nbuilding a chatboard which is powered by\nbuilding a chatboard which is powered by LLM and if you ask a question what is a\nLLM and if you ask a question what is a\nLLM and if you ask a question what is a refund policy on t-shirt it won't be\nrefund policy on t-shirt it won't be\nrefund policy on t-shirt it won't be able to answer it because it doesn't\nable to answer it because it doesn't\nable to answer it because it doesn't have access to your private\nhave access to your private\nhave access to your private organizational data to solve this\norganizational data to solve this\norganizational data to solve this problem you build a rag chatbot which is\nproblem you build a rag chatbot which is\nproblem you build a rag chatbot which is retrieval augmented generation where you\nretrieval augmented generation where you\nretrieval augmented generation where you provide your policy documents to LLM and\nprovide your policy documents to LLM and\nprovide your policy documents to LLM and it will be able to then fetch the answer\nit will be able to then fetch the answer\nit will be able to then fetch the answer out of those documents. ments. So here\nout of those documents. ments. So here\nout of those documents. ments. So here step by step what you're doing is you\nstep by step what you're doing is you\nstep by step what you're doing is you are first retrieving the documents then\nare first retrieving the documents then\nare first retrieving the documents then you're splitting it into chunks to take\nyou're splitting it into chunks to take\nyou're splitting it into chunks to take care of the context window for llm then\ncare of the context window for llm then\ncare of the context window for llm then you store it in vector database for\nyou store it in vector database for\nyou store it in vector database for semantic search later on then you\nsemantic search later on then you\nsemantic search later on then you retrieve and call llm and so on. Now you\nretrieve and call llm and so on. Now you\nretrieve and call llm and so on. Now you can do all of this in Python but lang\ncan do all of this in Python but lang\ncan do all of this in Python but lang chain is a beautiful framework that\nchain is a beautiful framework that\nchain is a beautiful framework that makes these things easier by providing\nmakes these things easier by providing\nmakes these things easier by providing readymade classes. So for this it will\nreadymade classes. So for this it will\nreadymade classes. So for this it will have text loader. These are all the\nhave text loader. These are all the\nhave text loader. These are all the classes from lang chain library. If you\nclasses from lang chain library. If you\nclasses from lang chain library. If you categorize LLM powered application into\ncategorize LLM powered application into\ncategorize LLM powered application into two groups then those two groups uh as\ntwo groups then those two groups uh as\ntwo groups then those two groups uh as per anthropics building effective agent\nper anthropics building effective agent\nper anthropics building effective agent guide are workflows and agents.\nguide are workflows and agents.\nguide are workflows and agents. Workflows is basically a software where\nWorkflows is basically a software where\nWorkflows is basically a software where one of the component is LLM and\none of the component is LLM and\none of the component is LLM and remaining things are joined by a\nremaining things are joined by a\nremaining things are joined by a predefined core path just like any usual\npredefined core path just like any usual\npredefined core path just like any usual software. So let's say you might be\nsoftware. So let's say you might be\nsoftware. So let's say you might be loading data from somewhere. Then you're\nloading data from somewhere. Then you're\nloading data from somewhere. Then you're doing some pre-processing and then you\ndoing some pre-processing and then you\ndoing some pre-processing and then you use LLM let's say to extract information\nuse LLM let's say to extract information\nuse LLM let's say to extract information out of that text or to do something\nout of that text or to do something\nout of that text or to do something else. Okay. Then you have one other\nelse. Okay. Then you have one other\nelse. Okay. Then you have one other step. Then you might have another LLM\nstep. Then you might have another LLM\nstep. Then you might have another LLM call. So this is like a usual software.\ncall. So this is like a usual software.\ncall. So this is like a usual software. It is just that LLM is one or more\nIt is just that LLM is one or more\nIt is just that LLM is one or more component in in that software ecosystem.\ncomponent in in that software ecosystem.\ncomponent in in that software ecosystem. This kind of uh thing is called chain\nThis kind of uh thing is called chain\nThis kind of uh thing is called chain and lang chain is a framework that makes\nand lang chain is a framework that makes\nand lang chain is a framework that makes building llm powered application easy.\nbuilding llm powered application easy.\nbuilding llm powered application easy. Especially it is used mainly to build\nEspecially it is used mainly to build\nEspecially it is used mainly to build straightforward chains whatever we saw.\nstraightforward chains whatever we saw.\nstraightforward chains whatever we saw. So there are steps that you follow to\nSo there are steps that you follow to\nSo there are steps that you follow to build your application and one of the\nbuild your application and one of the\nbuild your application and one of the step is LLM. So here LLM is not making\nstep is LLM. So here LLM is not making\nstep is LLM. So here LLM is not making any autonomous decision. It is given a\nany autonomous decision. It is given a\nany autonomous decision. It is given a predefined task that okay from this text\npredefined task that okay from this text\npredefined task that okay from this text extract this information or summarize\nextract this information or summarize\nextract this information or summarize this information and remaining thing is\nthis information and remaining thing is\nthis information and remaining thing is all your Python or whatever programming\nall your Python or whatever programming\nall your Python or whatever programming language you're using is just code.\nlanguage you're using is just code.\nlanguage you're using is just code. Okay. Now let's say you want to build a\nOkay. Now let's say you want to build a\nOkay. Now let's say you want to build a complex chatboard where customer is\ncomplex chatboard where customer is\ncomplex chatboard where customer is asking I want to exchange my t-shirt for\nasking I want to exchange my t-shirt for\nasking I want to exchange my t-shirt for a different item and you will then ask\na different item and you will then ask\na different item and you will then ask for order ID. Right? This is not\nfor order ID. Right? This is not\nfor order ID. Right? This is not something you can just answer in one\nsomething you can just answer in one\nsomething you can just answer in one shot. Then they will provide order ID.\nshot. Then they will provide order ID.\nshot. Then they will provide order ID. Now you'll say okay now with which item\nNow you'll say okay now with which item\nNow you'll say okay now with which item you want to replace. So they provide SKU\nyou want to replace. So they provide SKU\nyou want to replace. So they provide SKU and there is some interaction there is\nand there is some interaction there is\nand there is some interaction there is some kind of a multi-turn approach here\nsome kind of a multi-turn approach here\nsome kind of a multi-turn approach here to summarize the steps you have to check\nto summarize the steps you have to check\nto summarize the steps you have to check first the refund policy for the item\nfirst the refund policy for the item\nfirst the refund policy for the item that they are returning then you check\nthat they are returning then you check\nthat they are returning then you check order details in the database to make\norder details in the database to make\norder details in the database to make sure that you know uh the item is\nsure that you know uh the item is\nsure that you know uh the item is eligible and what was the price and so\neligible and what was the price and so\neligible and what was the price and so on. Then you check availability of the\non. Then you check availability of the\non. Then you check availability of the new item order new item print shipping\nnew item order new item print shipping\nnew item order new item print shipping label for old item. So this is not like\nlabel for old item. So this is not like\nlabel for old item. So this is not like a simple question okay what is my refund\na simple question okay what is my refund\na simple question okay what is my refund policy 30 days this requires multiple\npolicy 30 days this requires multiple\npolicy 30 days this requires multiple steps multiple clarification it's a\nsteps multiple clarification it's a\nsteps multiple clarification it's a complex flow and in each of the flow for\ncomplex flow and in each of the flow for\ncomplex flow and in each of the flow for refund policy you might have to access\nrefund policy you might have to access\nrefund policy you might have to access your policy documents for checking order\nyour policy documents for checking order\nyour policy documents for checking order details you might have to hit some\ndetails you might have to hit some\ndetails you might have to hit some database for checking availability of a\ndatabase for checking availability of a\ndatabase for checking availability of a new item you might be calling some\nnew item you might be calling some\nnew item you might be calling some micros service some API and to print\nmicros service some API and to print\nmicros service some API and to print label or you might be using some other\nlabel or you might be using some other\nlabel or you might be using some other software and in each of these steps LLM\nsoftware and in each of these steps LLM\nsoftware and in each of these steps LLM will be involved Okay. So, LLM either in\nwill be involved Okay. So, LLM either in\nwill be involved Okay. So, LLM either in all the steps or some of the steps LLM\nall the steps or some of the steps LLM\nall the steps or some of the steps LLM will be there and along with LLM you\nwill be there and along with LLM you\nwill be there and along with LLM you have documents, database, API etc. which\nhave documents, database, API etc. which\nhave documents, database, API etc. which will help you perform all these task.\nwill help you perform all these task.\nwill help you perform all these task. So, you are essentially doing goal\nSo, you are essentially doing goal\nSo, you are essentially doing goal oriented planning for a return that\noriented planning for a return that\noriented planning for a return that customer want to perform in the exchange\ncustomer want to perform in the exchange\ncustomer want to perform in the exchange of a new item. You first figure out all\nof a new item. You first figure out all\nof a new item. You first figure out all these four steps. Then you do multi-step\nthese four steps. Then you do multi-step\nthese four steps. Then you do multi-step reasoning, multi-step planning. You\nreasoning, multi-step planning. You\nreasoning, multi-step planning. You perform these steps uh one by one. Now\nperform these steps uh one by one. Now\nperform these steps uh one by one. Now let's say some of the steps might fail.\nlet's say some of the steps might fail.\nlet's say some of the steps might fail. Okay. So check the availability of new\nOkay. So check the availability of new\nOkay. So check the availability of new item. Let's say it fails. You might have\nitem. Let's say it fails. You might have\nitem. Let's say it fails. You might have to hit different API different color\nto hit different API different color\nto hit different API different color something something like that. You know\nsomething something like that. You know\nsomething something like that. You know then you have access to tools, right?\nthen you have access to tools, right?\nthen you have access to tools, right? These are tools. Knowledge knowledge is\nThese are tools. Knowledge knowledge is\nThese are tools. Knowledge knowledge is all PDF and database knowledge API etc.\nall PDF and database knowledge API etc.\nall PDF and database knowledge API etc. are called tools. All right. So this is\nare called tools. All right. So this is\nare called tools. All right. So this is an agentic chatboard. Agentic chatboard\nan agentic chatboard. Agentic chatboard\nan agentic chatboard. Agentic chatboard works on a complex task. It will divide\nworks on a complex task. It will divide\nworks on a complex task. It will divide it into multiple subtask. Then it will\nit into multiple subtask. Then it will\nit into multiple subtask. Then it will perform them one by one. Let's say\nperform them one by one. Let's say\nperform them one by one. Let's say second step fails. It will retry it.\nsecond step fails. It will retry it.\nsecond step fails. It will retry it. Okay. So there is a component of retry,\nOkay. So there is a component of retry,\nOkay. So there is a component of retry, feedback, etc. Just like how as humans\nfeedback, etc. Just like how as humans\nfeedback, etc. Just like how as humans we do the work. Let's say you are doing\nwe do the work. Let's say you are doing\nwe do the work. Let's say you are doing coding. You run the code, you find an\ncoding. You run the code, you find an\ncoding. You run the code, you find an error, then you fix the error, you know,\nerror, then you fix the error, you know,\nerror, then you fix the error, you know, you again run the code, then you find\nyou again run the code, then you find\nyou again run the code, then you find let's say another issue, then you fix\nlet's say another issue, then you fix\nlet's say another issue, then you fix that. So it's iterative approach.\nthat. So it's iterative approach.\nthat. So it's iterative approach. Agentic chatboard has some kind of\nAgentic chatboard has some kind of\nAgentic chatboard has some kind of autonomy and it will do this kind of\nautonomy and it will do this kind of\nautonomy and it will do this kind of multi-step iterative approach to\nmulti-step iterative approach to\nmulti-step iterative approach to accomplish a goal. Now one of the\naccomplish a goal. Now one of the\naccomplish a goal. Now one of the popular design for building agentic\npopular design for building agentic\npopular design for building agentic application is graph based stateful\napplication is graph based stateful\napplication is graph based stateful workflow. What I mean by that is let's\nworkflow. What I mean by that is let's\nworkflow. What I mean by that is let's say you start somewhere and you are\nsay you start somewhere and you are\nsay you start somewhere and you are making an LLM call. Okay. And then LLM\nmaking an LLM call. Okay. And then LLM\nmaking an LLM call. Okay. And then LLM will decide what to do as a next step.\nwill decide what to do as a next step.\nwill decide what to do as a next step. So let's say there is some conditional\nSo let's say there is some conditional\nSo let's say there is some conditional logic and LLM might decide to perform\nlogic and LLM might decide to perform\nlogic and LLM might decide to perform step A or step B or it might decide to\nstep A or step B or it might decide to\nstep A or step B or it might decide to make another call to a different LLM and\nmake another call to a different LLM and\nmake another call to a different LLM and same way when you're here this LLM can\nsame way when you're here this LLM can\nsame way when you're here this LLM can also autonomously I mean there will be\nalso autonomously I mean there will be\nalso autonomously I mean there will be some kind of prompt that will be given\nsome kind of prompt that will be given\nsome kind of prompt that will be given but the actual decision is made by this\nbut the actual decision is made by this\nbut the actual decision is made by this LLM in autonomous way it can perform\nLLM in autonomous way it can perform\nLLM in autonomous way it can perform either step C D E etc or it can actually\neither step C D E etc or it can actually\neither step C D E etc or it can actually call back to the original LLM. So there\ncall back to the original LLM. So there\ncall back to the original LLM. So there are four possible core paths. So this is\nare four possible core paths. So this is\nare four possible core paths. So this is a stateful workflow represented as a\na stateful workflow represented as a\na stateful workflow represented as a graph and langraph is a framework to\ngraph and langraph is a framework to\ngraph and langraph is a framework to orchestrate multi-step\norchestrate multi-step\norchestrate multi-step stateful workflows using graph-based\nstateful workflows using graph-based\nstateful workflows using graph-based structure. Here I'm showing you a code\nstructure. Here I'm showing you a code\nstructure. Here I'm showing you a code of\nof\nof one of the graphs we built in in\none of the graphs we built in in\none of the graphs we built in in Langraph. So you import all these\nLangraph. So you import all these\nLangraph. So you import all these libraries. Okay. And then uh you have a\nlibraries. Okay. And then uh you have a\nlibraries. Okay. And then uh you have a this tool. So tool is a dummy python\nthis tool. So tool is a dummy python\nthis tool. So tool is a dummy python tool. It just gets the latest price of\ntool. It just gets the latest price of\ntool. It just gets the latest price of any stock Microsoft, Apple etc. And then\nany stock Microsoft, Apple etc. And then\nany stock Microsoft, Apple etc. And then uh you design the graph like this. So if\nuh you design the graph like this. So if\nuh you design the graph like this. So if I show you the graph is nothing but you\nI show you the graph is nothing but you\nI show you the graph is nothing but you start then there's a chatboard and as a\nstart then there's a chatboard and as a\nstart then there's a chatboard and as a tool you have that function the you know\ntool you have that function the you know\ntool you have that function the you know get stock price function. Okay. So when\nget stock price function. Okay. So when\nget stock price function. Okay. So when you perform all these steps eventually\nyou perform all these steps eventually\nyou perform all these steps eventually when you say I want to buy 20 Amazon\nwhen you say I want to buy 20 Amazon\nwhen you say I want to buy 20 Amazon stocks it will be able to call that\nstocks it will be able to call that\nstocks it will be able to call that function get the price and then you know\nfunction get the price and then you know\nfunction get the price and then you know it's performing those steps to kind of\nit's performing those steps to kind of\nit's performing those steps to kind of call the tool multiple times and then\ncall the tool multiple times and then\ncall the tool multiple times and then give you a total amount for your entire\ngive you a total amount for your entire\ngive you a total amount for your entire stock transaction. If you want to learn\nstock transaction. If you want to learn\nstock transaction. If you want to learn lang graph in detail then I have this uh\nlang graph in detail then I have this uh\nlang graph in detail then I have this uh tutorial. It's like more than 1 hour\ntutorial. It's like more than 1 hour\ntutorial. It's like more than 1 hour tutorial which will walk you through the\ntutorial which will walk you through the\ntutorial which will walk you through the entire framework from the very\nentire framework from the very\nentire framework from the very beginning. Let's summarize the\nbeginning. Let's summarize the\nbeginning. Let's summarize the difference between these two. So lang\ndifference between these two. So lang\ndifference between these two. So lang chain is a toolkit that allows you to\nchain is a toolkit that allows you to\nchain is a toolkit that allows you to build llm apps chains tools agents.\nbuild llm apps chains tools agents.\nbuild llm apps chains tools agents. Whereas lang graph is a framework that\nWhereas lang graph is a framework that\nWhereas lang graph is a framework that is used mainly for agent. So just\nis used mainly for agent. So just\nis used mainly for agent. So just remember if you are writing a simple\nremember if you are writing a simple\nremember if you are writing a simple linear workflows you use lang chain but\nlinear workflows you use lang chain but\nlinear workflows you use lang chain but if you want to build complex agents use\nif you want to build complex agents use\nif you want to build complex agents use lang graph. style for lang chain is\nlang graph. style for lang chain is\nlang graph. style for lang chain is linear and reactive. Reactive means like\nlinear and reactive. Reactive means like\nlinear and reactive. Reactive means like you give some task it will return the\nyou give some task it will return the\nyou give some task it will return the response okay input output whereas lang\nresponse okay input output whereas lang\nresponse okay input output whereas lang graph has a graph base supports it\ngraph has a graph base supports it\ngraph has a graph base supports it supports loops retries you know it will\nsupports loops retries you know it will\nsupports loops retries you know it will retry to fix the error and kind of get\nretry to fix the error and kind of get\nretry to fix the error and kind of get the thing done it also has a memory base\nthe thing done it also has a memory base\nthe thing done it also has a memory base use case for lang chain is simple\nuse case for lang chain is simple\nuse case for lang chain is simple chatboard rag etc lang graph is as I\nchatboard rag etc lang graph is as I\nchatboard rag etc lang graph is as I said multi-step workflows complex agents\nsaid multi-step workflows complex agents\nsaid multi-step workflows complex agents and lang chain is partially stateful\nand lang chain is partially stateful\nand lang chain is partially stateful where lang graph has a state in that\nwhere lang graph has a state in that\nwhere lang graph has a state in that graph. So if you refer to my lang graph\ngraph. So if you refer to my lang graph\ngraph. So if you refer to my lang graph tutorial, you will get better\ntutorial, you will get better\ntutorial, you will get better understanding just in case if you don't\nunderstanding just in case if you don't\nunderstanding just in case if you don't know about graphs and states. Uh and\nknow about graphs and states. Uh and\nknow about graphs and states. Uh and here are the example use cases. Now what\nhere are the example use cases. Now what\nhere are the example use cases. Now what is lang? Well, lang is a debugging and\nis lang? Well, lang is a debugging and\nis lang? Well, lang is a debugging and observability platform folks. So if you\nobservability platform folks. So if you\nobservability platform folks. So if you look at the architecture,\nlook at the architecture,\nlook at the architecture, see this is an entire like ecosystem\nsee this is an entire like ecosystem\nsee this is an entire like ecosystem where you have lang and langraph they\nwhere you have lang and langraph they\nwhere you have lang and langraph they both are open source. Okay. Then you\nboth are open source. Okay. Then you\nboth are open source. Okay. Then you have langsmith which is uh doing the\nhave langsmith which is uh doing the\nhave langsmith which is uh doing the work of debugging playground prompt\nwork of debugging playground prompt\nwork of debugging playground prompt management monitoring you know so let's\nmanagement monitoring you know so let's\nmanagement monitoring you know so let's say if you deploy the aentki system in\nsay if you deploy the aentki system in\nsay if you deploy the aentki system in the production you want to monitor\nthe production you want to monitor\nthe production you want to monitor whether it's performing well you want to\nwhether it's performing well you want to\nwhether it's performing well you want to monitor your token cost okay it's not\nmonitor your token cost okay it's not\nmonitor your token cost okay it's not like you're spending millions of dollars\nlike you're spending millions of dollars\nlike you're spending millions of dollars in your token cost so all of those\nin your token cost so all of those\nin your token cost so all of those failures evaluation all of those things\nfailures evaluation all of those things\nfailures evaluation all of those things are done through langmmith so here is a\nare done through langmmith so here is a\nare done through langmmith so here is a lang UI where there's this demo demo app\nlang UI where there's this demo demo app\nlang UI where there's this demo demo app and really here you can see all the\nand really here you can see all the\nand really here you can see all the individual calls right you called vector\nindividual calls right you called vector\nindividual calls right you called vector database then you called chat GPT okay\ndatabase then you called chat GPT okay\ndatabase then you called chat GPT okay what was the input what was the output\nwhat was the input what was the output\nwhat was the input what was the output how many tokens did you use 390 what was\nhow many tokens did you use 390 what was\nhow many tokens did you use 390 what was the latency so you can monitor all of\nthe latency so you can monitor all of\nthe latency so you can monitor all of that this is just tracing but you can do\nthat this is just tracing but you can do\nthat this is just tracing but you can do much more than this if you want to learn\nmuch more than this if you want to learn\nmuch more than this if you want to learn these things in detail once again I have\nthese things in detail once again I have\nthese things in detail once again I have complete tutorials if you have any\ncomplete tutorials if you have any\ncomplete tutorials if you have any questions please post in the comment box\nquestions please post in the comment box\nquestions please post in the comment box below I hope you got some understanding\nbelow I hope you got some understanding\nbelow I hope you got some understanding of lang lang graph and Lang Smith.

Now I've\nbetween langin versus langraph. Now I've\nbetween langin versus langraph. Now I've been making similar kind of videos from\nbeen making similar kind of videos from\nbeen making similar kind of videos from past couple of weeks uh or from past\npast couple of weeks uh or from past\npast couple of weeks uh or from past month and here our main aim is to make\nmonth and here our main aim is to make\nmonth and here our main aim is to make our fundamentals quite stronger. Let's\nour fundamentals quite stronger. Let's\nour fundamentals quite stronger. Let's say that if I ask you a question in an\nsay that if I ask you a question in an\nsay that if I ask you a question in an interview when should we probably go\ninterview when should we probably go\ninterview when should we probably go ahead and use langraph or what is the\nahead and use langraph or what is the\nahead and use langraph or what is the differences between lang and lang graph\ndifferences between lang and lang graph\ndifferences between lang and lang graph what would you probably try to explain\nwhat would you probably try to explain\nwhat would you probably try to explain just write down in the comment section\njust write down in the comment section\njust write down in the comment section before seeing the specific video and\nbefore seeing the specific video and\nbefore seeing the specific video and then after you write down the comment\nthen after you write down the comment\nthen after you write down the comment right just go through this entire video\nright just go through this entire video\nright just go through this entire video and then try to see that how many things\nand then try to see that how many things\nand then try to see that how many things that I've actually told does it matches\nthat I've actually told does it matches\nthat I've actually told does it matches with all the information that you have\nwith all the information that you have\nwith all the information that you have right so please make sure to do that but\nright so please make sure to do that but\nright so please make sure to do that but in this video we are going to have a\nin this video we are going to have a\nin this video we are going to have a detailed discussion between lang chain\ndetailed discussion between lang chain\ndetailed discussion between lang chain versus lang graph.

Now if I talk about langchain in lang\nNow if I talk about langchain in lang\nNow if I talk about langchain in lang chain obviously this is this langchain\nchain obviously this is this langchain\nchain obviously this is this langchain is basically used to create if I\nis basically used to create if I\nis basically used to create if I probably say it is used to create llm\nprobably say it is used to create llm\nprobably say it is used to create llm powered\npowered\npowered application llm\napplication llm\napplication llm powered chatbot assistant it can be it\npowered chatbot assistant it can be it\npowered chatbot assistant it can be it can be an application or generative AI\ncan be an application or generative AI\ncan be an application or generative AI application okay now when I say LLM\napplication okay now when I say LLM\napplication okay now when I say LLM powered that basically means anything\npowered that basically means anything\npowered that basically means anything that you create whether you create a\nthat you create whether you create a\nthat you create whether you create a chatbot Whether you create a simple app\nchatbot Whether you create a simple app\nchatbot Whether you create a simple app or whether you create any kind of\nor whether you create any kind of\nor whether you create any kind of application right at the end of the day\napplication right at the end of the day\napplication right at the end of the day you are specifically using\nyou are specifically using\nyou are specifically using LLMs right on top of this LLMs there are\nLLMs right on top of this LLMs there are\nLLMs right on top of this LLMs there are multiple things that can be used here\nmultiple things that can be used here\nmultiple things that can be used here you can use prompts along with the LLMs\nyou can use prompts along with the LLMs\nyou can use prompts along with the LLMs you can use\nyou can use\nyou can use tools you can use different kind of\ntools you can use different kind of\ntools you can use different kind of integrations and many more\nintegrations and many more\nintegrations and many more things so overall if I probably talk\nthings so overall if I probably talk\nthings so overall if I probably talk about lang chain\nabout lang chain\nabout lang chain Any application that is basically\nAny application that is basically\nAny application that is basically developed in Langchain, a generative AI\ndeveloped in Langchain, a generative AI\ndeveloped in Langchain, a generative AI application or LLM powered application\napplication or LLM powered application\napplication or LLM powered application or a AI chatbot assistant. There are\nor a AI chatbot assistant. There are\nor a AI chatbot assistant. There are three main important steps that happens\nthree main important steps that happens\nthree main important steps that happens in Langchain. This is my one step. This\nin Langchain. This is my one step. This\nin Langchain. This is my one step. This is my another step and this is my third\nis my another step and this is my third\nis my another step and this is my third step.\nstep.\nstep. Okay. So these are the three main\nOkay. So these are the three main\nOkay. So these are the three main components. Now what are these specific\ncomponents. Now what are these specific\ncomponents. Now what are these specific components? When I say steps, I'm\ncomponents? When I say steps, I'm\ncomponents? When I say steps, I'm basically talking about components. The\nbasically talking about components. The\nbasically talking about components. The first component is nothing but it is\nfirst component is nothing but it is\nfirst component is nothing but it is basically called\nbasically called\nbasically called as retrieve. Okay. So here we are\nas retrieve. Okay. So here we are\nas retrieve. Okay. So here we are basically going to write it as retrieve.\nbasically going to write it as retrieve.\nbasically going to write it as retrieve. Retrieve or retriever. Then the second\nRetrieve or retriever. Then the second\nRetrieve or retriever. Then the second important component is nothing but\nimportant component is nothing but\nimportant component is nothing but summarize. And the third important\nsummarize. And the third important\nsummarize. And the third important component is nothing but your final\ncomponent is nothing but your final\ncomponent is nothing but your final answer or output. Okay. Now when we talk\nanswer or output. Okay. Now when we talk\nanswer or output. Okay. Now when we talk about this components. Okay. So here I\nabout this components. Okay. So here I\nabout this components. Okay. So here I will just go ahead and write output.\nwill just go ahead and write output.\nwill just go ahead and write output. Okay. When we talk about the specific\nOkay. When we talk about the specific\nOkay. When we talk about the specific components in lang chain whether you\ncomponents in lang chain whether you\ncomponents in lang chain whether you generate any kind of generative AI\ngenerate any kind of generative AI\ngenerate any kind of generative AI applications empowered application or AI\napplications empowered application or AI\napplications empowered application or AI assistant these three components will be\nassistant these three components will be\nassistant these three components will be definitely there. Now the question rises\ndefinitely there. Now the question rises\ndefinitely there. Now the question rises kish what does exactly happen in the\nkish what does exactly happen in the\nkish what does exactly happen in the directory in retrieve? There are three\ndirectory in retrieve? There are three\ndirectory in retrieve? There are three main important things that we basically\nmain important things that we basically\nmain important things that we basically do. One is data injection.\ndo. One is data injection.\ndo. One is data injection. Now the question rises what is data\nNow the question rises what is data\nNow the question rises what is data injection? Data injection is very\ninjection? Data injection is very\ninjection? Data injection is very simple, right? We ingest a data right we\nsimple, right? We ingest a data right we\nsimple, right? We ingest a data right we probably load a data from a specific\nprobably load a data from a specific\nprobably load a data from a specific source. Now the main thing is that here\nsource. Now the main thing is that here\nsource. Now the main thing is that here the source can be different different it\nthe source can be different different it\nthe source can be different different it can be a PDF file. It can be an external\ncan be a PDF file. It can be an external\ncan be a PDF file. It can be an external database. It can be an excel file. It\ndatabase. It can be an excel file. It\ndatabase. It can be an excel file. It can be a website. You need to probably\ncan be a website. You need to probably\ncan be a website. You need to probably web scrap the data. There may be various\nweb scrap the data. There may be various\nweb scrap the data. There may be various different ways right in data injection.\ndifferent ways right in data injection.\ndifferent ways right in data injection. So when we talk about data injection\nSo when we talk about data injection\nSo when we talk about data injection this is also called as we basically use\nthis is also called as we basically use\nthis is also called as we basically use something called as document loader over\nsomething called as document loader over\nsomething called as document loader over here right. So we use nothing but\nhere right. So we use nothing but\nhere right. So we use nothing but document loader. So in langchain you\ndocument loader. So in langchain you\ndocument loader. So in langchain you have a specific class uh where you have\nhave a specific class uh where you have\nhave a specific class uh where you have lot of packages and integration\nlot of packages and integration\nlot of packages and integration specifically with respect to document\nspecifically with respect to document\nspecifically with respect to document loader. Here the main aim is that you\nloader. Here the main aim is that you\nloader. Here the main aim is that you try to load documents from different\ntry to load documents from different\ntry to load documents from different different sources. It can be any source.\ndifferent sources. It can be any source.\ndifferent sources. It can be any source. It can be a PDF file. It can be a excel\nIt can be a PDF file. It can be a excel\nIt can be a PDF file. It can be a excel file. It can be a CSV file. It can even\nfile. It can be a CSV file. It can even\nfile. It can be a CSV file. It can even be some third-party APIs like Wikipedia.\nbe some third-party APIs like Wikipedia.\nbe some third-party APIs like Wikipedia. It can be r. It can be anything as such.\nIt can be r. It can be anything as such.\nIt can be r. It can be anything as such. Right? So they are multiple sources and\nRight? So they are multiple sources and\nRight? So they are multiple sources and langen has a huge amount of different\nlangen has a huge amount of different\nlangen has a huge amount of different different kind of integrations already\ndifferent kind of integrations already\ndifferent kind of integrations already provided in terms of document loader.\nprovided in terms of document loader.\nprovided in terms of document loader. And what I feel is that whenever you try\nAnd what I feel is that whenever you try\nAnd what I feel is that whenever you try to develop any of this kind of\nto develop any of this kind of\nto develop any of this kind of application, this is the most important\napplication, this is the most important\napplication, this is the most important step because here the parsing of the\nstep because here the parsing of the\nstep because here the parsing of the data will happen, right? The parsing of\ndata will happen, right? The parsing of\ndata will happen, right? The parsing of the data will happen. The more in a like\nthe data will happen. The more in a like\nthe data will happen. The more in a like when you do the parsing, if you do this\nwhen you do the parsing, if you do this\nwhen you do the parsing, if you do this much more accurately, then you will\nmuch more accurately, then you will\nmuch more accurately, then you will definitely be able to generate uh or\ndefinitely be able to generate uh or\ndefinitely be able to generate uh or create a generative AI application with\ncreate a generative AI application with\ncreate a generative AI application with much more accuracy. So now there are\nmuch more accuracy. So now there are\nmuch more accuracy. So now there are dedicated companies who specifically do\ndedicated companies who specifically do\ndedicated companies who specifically do this particular task who create this\nthis particular task who create this\nthis particular task who create this kind of packages with respect to\nkind of packages with respect to\nkind of packages with respect to document loader right I need to probably\ndocument loader right I need to probably\ndocument loader right I need to probably I create a document loader to let's say\nI create a document loader to let's say\nI create a document loader to let's say web scrap the data from the internet\nweb scrap the data from the internet\nweb scrap the data from the internet which will be a very important use case\nwhich will be a very important use case\nwhich will be a very important use case for most of the use case that we\nfor most of the use case that we\nfor most of the use case that we specifically implement in the industry.\nspecifically implement in the industry.\nspecifically implement in the industry. So in document loader this basically\nSo in document loader this basically\nSo in document loader this basically happens right and that is a part of data\nhappens right and that is a part of data\nhappens right and that is a part of data ingestion. Now coming to the second most\ningestion. Now coming to the second most\ningestion. Now coming to the second most important component. The second most\nimportant component. The second most\nimportant component. The second most important component is nothing but it is\nimportant component is nothing but it is\nimportant component is nothing but it is called as text\ncalled as text\ncalled as text splitter. Now text splitter is also a\nsplitter. Now text splitter is also a\nsplitter. Now text splitter is also a separate class that is available in lang\nseparate class that is available in lang\nseparate class that is available in lang chain or a separate package wherein\nchain or a separate package wherein\nchain or a separate package wherein there are multiple ways of splitting the\nthere are multiple ways of splitting the\nthere are multiple ways of splitting the text. Once you read the data from all\ntext. Once you read the data from all\ntext. Once you read the data from all these kind of sources, right? We I\nthese kind of sources, right? We I\nthese kind of sources, right? We I cannot just directly provide the entire\ncannot just directly provide the entire\ncannot just directly provide the entire data to my LLM model as a context.\ndata to my LLM model as a context.\ndata to my LLM model as a context. Right? So what I have to do why I cannot\nRight? So what I have to do why I cannot\nRight? So what I have to do why I cannot provide because there is a very\nprovide because there is a very\nprovide because there is a very important component which is called as\nimportant component which is called as\nimportant component which is called as context window. Every LLM has a\ncontext window. Every LLM has a\ncontext window. Every LLM has a limitation with respect to the context\nlimitation with respect to the context\nlimitation with respect to the context window. So in order to overcome this\nwindow. So in order to overcome this\nwindow. So in order to overcome this what we do is that once we read the data\nwhat we do is that once we read the data\nwhat we do is that once we read the data from this data source we try to divide\nfrom this data source we try to divide\nfrom this data source we try to divide this data into smaller\nthis data into smaller\nthis data into smaller chunks into smaller chunks. Smaller\nchunks into smaller chunks. Smaller\nchunks into smaller chunks. Smaller chunks smaller chunks. Once we divide\nchunks smaller chunks. Once we divide\nchunks smaller chunks. Once we divide this data into smaller chunk then the\nthis data into smaller chunk then the\nthis data into smaller chunk then the next step because after we divide this\nnext step because after we divide this\nnext step because after we divide this we need to store it somewhere right and\nwe need to store it somewhere right and\nwe need to store it somewhere right and that is where your third important\nthat is where your third important\nthat is where your third important component comes is nothing but vector\ncomponent comes is nothing but vector\ncomponent comes is nothing but vector databases. Now inside this vector\ndatabases. Now inside this vector\ndatabases. Now inside this vector databases when we are specifically using\ndatabases when we are specifically using\ndatabases when we are specifically using vector databases here we also use\nvector databases here we also use\nvector databases here we also use something called as vector embeddings.\nsomething called as vector embeddings.\nsomething called as vector embeddings. Now for vector embeddings it is nothing\nNow for vector embeddings it is nothing\nNow for vector embeddings it is nothing but we are converting the text into\nbut we are converting the text into\nbut we are converting the text into vectors that is the main aim with\nvectors that is the main aim with\nvectors that is the main aim with respect to vector embeddings right. So\nrespect to vector embeddings right. So\nrespect to vector embeddings right. So this is a kind of a task wherein we\nthis is a kind of a task wherein we\nthis is a kind of a task wherein we convert the text into vectors. So once\nconvert the text into vectors. So once\nconvert the text into vectors. So once it is basically converted we basically\nit is basically converted we basically\nit is basically converted we basically store that into the vector database. Now\nstore that into the vector database. Now\nstore that into the vector database. Now the question arises why do we store it\nthe question arises why do we store it\nthe question arises why do we store it right because at the end of the day from\nright because at the end of the day from\nright because at the end of the day from my any application if all my data is\nmy any application if all my data is\nmy any application if all my data is basically stored in a vector database we\nbasically stored in a vector database we\nbasically stored in a vector database we will definitely be able to do different\nwill definitely be able to do different\nwill definitely be able to do different different kind of search. One search\ndifferent kind of search. One search\ndifferent kind of search. One search example is nothing but semantic search.\nexample is nothing but semantic search.\nexample is nothing but semantic search. It can be graph DB search right and with\nIt can be graph DB search right and with\nIt can be graph DB search right and with the help of this search we will be able\nthe help of this search we will be able\nthe help of this search we will be able to retrieve the right amount of context\nto retrieve the right amount of context\nto retrieve the right amount of context and give it to our LLM to finally\nand give it to our LLM to finally\nand give it to our LLM to finally generate the output right and that is\ngenerate the output right and that is\ngenerate the output right and that is really important right unless and until\nreally important right unless and until\nreally important right unless and until this is not done accurately and we don't\nthis is not done accurately and we don't\nthis is not done accurately and we don't get the right kind of context out of the\nget the right kind of context out of the\nget the right kind of context out of the directed database we will not be able to\ndirected database we will not be able to\ndirected database we will not be able to accurately give the output to the user\naccurately give the output to the user\naccurately give the output to the user right so in the retrieve component of\nright so in the retrieve component of\nright so in the retrieve component of lang chain you really need to be good at\nlang chain you really need to be good at\nlang chain you really need to be good at all the specific things when you go\nall the specific things when you go\nall the specific things when you go tomorrow to any companies to gen and if\ntomorrow to any companies to gen and if\ntomorrow to any companies to gen and if you're probably generating or developing\nyou're probably generating or developing\nyou're probably generating or developing a generative AI powered application you\na generative AI powered application you\na generative AI powered application you will be doing all the specific steps you\nwill be doing all the specific steps you\nwill be doing all the specific steps you need to parse the data you need to\nneed to parse the data you need to\nneed to parse the data you need to probably store the data in exact right\nprobably store the data in exact right\nprobably store the data in exact right format with respect to the document data\nformat with respect to the document data\nformat with respect to the document data type you need to make sure that you have\ntype you need to make sure that you have\ntype you need to make sure that you have to do this kind of chunking strategy so\nto do this kind of chunking strategy so\nto do this kind of chunking strategy so that you try to solve this context\nthat you try to solve this context\nthat you try to solve this context window size with respect to different\nwindow size with respect to different\nwindow size with respect to different different LLMs that you're using and\ndifferent LLMs that you're using and\ndifferent LLMs that you're using and finally you store all this particular\nfinally you store all this particular\nfinally you store all this particular data into the vector database. Okay. Now\ndata into the vector database. Okay. Now\ndata into the vector database. Okay. Now coming to the next important step after\ncoming to the next important step after\ncoming to the next important step after we probably complete this retrieve\nwe probably complete this retrieve\nwe probably complete this retrieve component. It is nothing but summarize.\ncomponent. It is nothing but summarize.\ncomponent. It is nothing but summarize. Now here is where you know and when we\nNow here is where you know and when we\nNow here is where you know and when we talk about summarize or when we talk\ntalk about summarize or when we talk\ntalk about summarize or when we talk about building generative AI\nabout building generative AI\nabout building generative AI applications uh with the help of lang\napplications uh with the help of lang\napplications uh with the help of lang chain here you specifically follow a\nchain here you specifically follow a\nchain here you specifically follow a sequential order. Okay, this is really\nsequential order. Okay, this is really\nsequential order. Okay, this is really important to understand and here you\nimportant to understand and here you\nimportant to understand and here you will definitely be understanding the\nwill definitely be understanding the\nwill definitely be understanding the differences between langin and lang\ndifferences between langin and lang\ndifferences between langin and lang graph. When we talk about sequential\ngraph. When we talk about sequential\ngraph. When we talk about sequential order, now what does this basically\norder, now what does this basically\norder, now what does this basically mean? In sequential order here, it\nmean? In sequential order here, it\nmean? In sequential order here, it basically means that the execution of\nbasically means that the execution of\nbasically means that the execution of any task will just happen\nany task will just happen\nany task will just happen sequentially. We cannot go back. Okay.\nsequentially. We cannot go back. Okay.\nsequentially. We cannot go back. Okay. So this entire langen the generative AI\nSo this entire langen the generative AI\nSo this entire langen the generative AI application that is developed with the\napplication that is developed with the\napplication that is developed with the help of langchen follows a DAG graph\nhelp of langchen follows a DAG graph\nhelp of langchen follows a DAG graph right directed a cyclic graph okay that\nright directed a cyclic graph okay that\nright directed a cyclic graph okay that basically means if my execution is\nbasically means if my execution is\nbasically means if my execution is basically started from this task it has\nbasically started from this task it has\nbasically started from this task it has to probably go to this task it has to go\nto probably go to this task it has to go\nto probably go to this task it has to go to this particular task only sequential\nto this particular task only sequential\nto this particular task only sequential I cannot come back this option is not\nI cannot come back this option is not\nI cannot come back this option is not there this option is not there right so\nthere this option is not there right so\nthere this option is not there right so when we talk about this summarize\nwhen we talk about this summarize\nwhen we talk about this summarize component here you'll be able to see\ncomponent here you'll be able to see\ncomponent here you'll be able to see that we create some kind of chaining\nthat we create some kind of chaining\nthat we create some kind of chaining concept. So in lang chain whenever a\nconcept. So in lang chain whenever a\nconcept. So in lang chain whenever a generative AI application is basically\ngenerative AI application is basically\ngenerative AI application is basically developed here we try to implement this\ndeveloped here we try to implement this\ndeveloped here we try to implement this chaining concept. Now in the chaining\nchaining concept. Now in the chaining\nchaining concept. Now in the chaining concept we first of all go ahead and\nconcept we first of all go ahead and\nconcept we first of all go ahead and write our prompt chain. So let's say\nwrite our prompt chain. So let's say\nwrite our prompt chain. So let's say this is my prompt chain right sorry this\nthis is my prompt chain right sorry this\nthis is my prompt chain right sorry this is my prompt. We basically go ahead and\nis my prompt. We basically go ahead and\nis my prompt. We basically go ahead and give a prompt. prompt is just like an\ngive a prompt. prompt is just like an\ngive a prompt. prompt is just like an instruction to an LLM right along with\ninstruction to an LLM right along with\ninstruction to an LLM right along with this we try to integrate this uh prompt\nthis we try to integrate this uh prompt\nthis we try to integrate this uh prompt with our LLM. So LLM will be my second\nwith our LLM. So LLM will be my second\nwith our LLM. So LLM will be my second thing in the chain right second\nthing in the chain right second\nthing in the chain right second important component in the chain and\nimportant component in the chain and\nimportant component in the chain and then the third important component can\nthen the third important component can\nthen the third important component can be my context the context that I'm\nbe my context the context that I'm\nbe my context the context that I'm supplying to the LLM. So this will\nsupplying to the LLM. So this will\nsupplying to the LLM. So this will basically be my\nbasically be my\nbasically be my prompt. This will be my llm and this\nprompt. This will be my llm and this\nprompt. This will be my llm and this will basically be my context and this\nwill basically be my context and this\nwill basically be my context and this context will be coming from the specific\ncontext will be coming from the specific\ncontext will be coming from the specific vector database. So internally you'll be\nvector database. So internally you'll be\nvector database. So internally you'll be able to see that this vector database\nable to see that this vector database\nable to see that this vector database will be comp connected to this\nwill be comp connected to this\nwill be comp connected to this particular chain itself wherein we will\nparticular chain itself wherein we will\nparticular chain itself wherein we will be providing the context and this\nbe providing the context and this\nbe providing the context and this execution takes place sequentially one\nexecution takes place sequentially one\nexecution takes place sequentially one after the other right and finally\nafter the other right and finally\nafter the other right and finally whatever output you basically get here\nwhatever output you basically get here\nwhatever output you basically get here we are basically going to use or here we\nwe are basically going to use or here we\nwe are basically going to use or here we are going to give the answer of the\nare going to give the answer of the\nare going to give the answer of the output here again we can use multiple\noutput here again we can use multiple\noutput here again we can use multiple components one component can be my\ncomponents one component can be my\ncomponents one component can be my memory right so here we can use some\nmemory right so here we can use some\nmemory right so here we can use some kind of persistent memory. So if you\nkind of persistent memory. So if you\nkind of persistent memory. So if you have been seeing my videos with respect\nhave been seeing my videos with respect\nhave been seeing my videos with respect to lang lang chain or lang lang graph I\nto lang lang chain or lang lang graph I\nto lang lang chain or lang lang graph I have covered all this specific thing\nhave covered all this specific thing\nhave covered all this specific thing right and next thing after this\nright and next thing after this\nright and next thing after this persisting memory I can also go ahead\npersisting memory I can also go ahead\npersisting memory I can also go ahead and probably combine prompt with a\nand probably combine prompt with a\nand probably combine prompt with a separate LLM over here prompt with a\nseparate LLM over here prompt with a\nseparate LLM over here prompt with a separate LLM over here so that we will\nseparate LLM over here so that we will\nseparate LLM over here so that we will be able to get the output right and\nbe able to get the output right and\nbe able to get the output right and finally here you can actually see that\nfinally here you can actually see that\nfinally here you can actually see that finally we generate this specific output\nfinally we generate this specific output\nfinally we generate this specific output so this can also be created in the form\nso this can also be created in the form\nso this can also be created in the form of chain but understand one thing\nof chain but understand one thing\nof chain but understand one thing everything is basically getting executed\neverything is basically getting executed\neverything is basically getting executed sequentially. This is the most important\nsequentially. This is the most important\nsequentially. This is the most important thing in the entire lang chain with\nthing in the entire lang chain with\nthing in the entire lang chain with respect to developing any generative AI\nrespect to developing any generative AI\nrespect to developing any generative AI powered applications. Okay. So here is\npowered applications. Okay. So here is\npowered applications. Okay. So here is what we basically do with the help of\nwhat we basically do with the help of\nwhat we basically do with the help of lang chain right and again I will again\nlang chain right and again I will again\nlang chain right and again I will again talk about the differences as we go\ntalk about the differences as we go\ntalk about the differences as we go ahead like what are the main exact\nahead like what are the main exact\nahead like what are the main exact differences and all here you saw that it\ndifferences and all here you saw that it\ndifferences and all here you saw that it is following a sequential order. It\nis following a sequential order. It\nis following a sequential order. It follows a directed earth cyclic graph.\nfollows a directed earth cyclic graph.\nfollows a directed earth cyclic graph. You know, uh here everything is in the\nYou know, uh here everything is in the\nYou know, uh here everything is in the form of chaining. Here we have these\nform of chaining. Here we have these\nform of chaining. Here we have these three important components. How each and\nthree important components. How each and\nthree important components. How each and every component is basically executed\nevery component is basically executed\nevery component is basically executed and how it proceeds to finally getting\nand how it proceeds to finally getting\nand how it proceeds to finally getting an output. Right? Now, similarly, if I\nan output. Right? Now, similarly, if I\nan output. Right? Now, similarly, if I talk about langraph, okay,\ntalk about langraph, okay,\ntalk about langraph, okay, langraph. Now when I talk about langraph\nlangraph. Now when I talk about langraph\nlangraph. Now when I talk about langraph here the main aim is basically to create\nhere the main aim is basically to create\nhere the main aim is basically to create stateful\nstateful\nstateful multi-\nmulti-\nmulti- AI agentic\napplication agentic application or AI\napplication agentic application or AI agents multi-state stateful multiAI\nagents multi-state stateful multiAI\nagents multi-state stateful multiAI agents itself right now here the main\nagents itself right now here the main\nagents itself right now here the main aim if I just want to probably break\naim if I just want to probably break\naim if I just want to probably break this down here you'll be able ble to see\nthis down here you'll be able ble to see\nthis down here you'll be able ble to see that we create AI agents and it's not\nthat we create AI agents and it's not\nthat we create AI agents and it's not like a simple a single AI agent it'll be\nlike a simple a single AI agent it'll be\nlike a simple a single AI agent it'll be multiple AI agents which will be doing\nmultiple AI agents which will be doing\nmultiple AI agents which will be doing separately different task and the best\nseparately different task and the best\nseparately different task and the best part about these AI agents is that they\npart about these AI agents is that they\npart about these AI agents is that they can communicate with each other to solve\ncan communicate with each other to solve\ncan communicate with each other to solve a complex\na complex\na complex workflow complex workflow I've already\nworkflow complex workflow I've already\nworkflow complex workflow I've already started my entire langraph playlist and\nstarted my entire langraph playlist and\nstarted my entire langraph playlist and I think if you're following them I've\nI think if you're following them I've\nI think if you're following them I've explained this entirely in a much more\nexplained this entirely in a much more\nexplained this entirely in a much more detailed manner uh you know in the live\ndetailed manner uh you know in the live\ndetailed manner uh you know in the live classes uh that I've actually taken in\nclasses uh that I've actually taken in\nclasses uh that I've actually taken in my YouTube channel right now here the\nmy YouTube channel right now here the\nmy YouTube channel right now here the main thing is that it need not be\nmain thing is that it need not be\nmain thing is that it need not be directed or cyclic graph it it even need\ndirected or cyclic graph it it even need\ndirected or cyclic graph it it even need not be sequential this can follow in a\nnot be sequential this can follow in a\nnot be sequential this can follow in a different ways okay so first of all\ndifferent ways okay so first of all\ndifferent ways okay so first of all we'll talk about what are the important\nwe'll talk about what are the important\nwe'll talk about what are the important components in lang graph okay some of\ncomponents in lang graph okay some of\ncomponents in lang graph okay some of the important components in lang graph\nthe important components in lang graph\nthe important components in lang graph are like tasks second important\nare like tasks second important\nare like tasks second important component we basically use as nodes\ncomponent we basically use as nodes\ncomponent we basically use as nodes third it'll be something called as\nthird it'll be something called as\nthird it'll be something called as edges. Fourth is nothing but graph. So\nedges. Fourth is nothing but graph. So\nedges. Fourth is nothing but graph. So that basically means my entire lang\nthat basically means my entire lang\nthat basically means my entire lang graph the complex workflows that is\ngraph the complex workflows that is\ngraph the complex workflows that is defined which will be it it'll be in the\ndefined which will be it it'll be in the\ndefined which will be it it'll be in the form of a graph and when you see a graph\nform of a graph and when you see a graph\nform of a graph and when you see a graph right if you probably have some\nright if you probably have some\nright if you probably have some knowledge about graph let's say uh here\nknowledge about graph let's say uh here\nknowledge about graph let's say uh here I will just go ahead and write this is\nI will just go ahead and write this is\nI will just go ahead and write this is my task A okay this is my task A right\nmy task A okay this is my task A right\nmy task A okay this is my task A right so let's say this is my task A this can\nso let's say this is my task A this can\nso let's say this is my task A this can be my task B this can be my task\nbe my task B this can be my task\nbe my task B this can be my task C this can be my task\nC this can be my task\nC this can be my task E and this can be my final task that is\nE and this can be my final task that is\nE and this can be my final task that is end let's\nend let's\nend let's say now each and every task over here so\nsay now each and every task over here so\nsay now each and every task over here so let's say if this is my task A this is\nlet's say if this is my task A this is\nlet's say if this is my task A this is my task B this is my task\nmy task B this is my task\nmy task B this is my task C this is my task\nC this is my task\nC this is my task D so when we talk about this kind of\nD so when we talk about this kind of\nD so when we talk about this kind of task we basically start from start over\ntask we basically start from start over\ntask we basically start from start over here there will be a conditional edge\nhere there will be a conditional edge\nhere there will be a conditional edge then we go to task D then finally we go\nthen we go to task D then finally we go\nthen we go to task D then finally we go to\nto\nto Now here also I'm showing sequential\nNow here also I'm showing sequential\nNow here also I'm showing sequential only but one important thing is that you\nonly but one important thing is that you\nonly but one important thing is that you can go back from task B to task A you\ncan go back from task B to task A you\ncan go back from task B to task A you can go back to task D to task C you can\ncan go back to task D to task C you can\ncan go back to task D to task C you can reexecute this and here you can come so\nreexecute this and here you can come so\nreexecute this and here you can come so that is the reason why I'm saying that\nthat is the reason why I'm saying that\nthat is the reason why I'm saying that this two important thing is basically\nthis two important thing is basically\nthis two important thing is basically happening that is communication within\nhappening that is communication within\nhappening that is communication within this particular task and each and every\nthis particular task and each and every\nthis particular task and each and every task is executed by a separate AI agent\ntask is executed by a separate AI agent\ntask is executed by a separate AI agent you can basically create a separate AI\nyou can basically create a separate AI\nyou can basically create a separate AI agent and perform that task similarly\nagent and perform that task similarly\nagent and perform that task similarly and the output of one task can be passed\nand the output of one task can be passed\nand the output of one task can be passed to the output of the other task. It can\nto the output of the other task. It can\nto the output of the other task. It can also be vice\nalso be vice\nalso be vice versa. Right? So here a feedback\nversa. Right? So here a feedback\nversa. Right? So here a feedback mechanism can also be generated and even\nmechanism can also be generated and even\nmechanism can also be generated and even human feedback mechanism can also be\nhuman feedback mechanism can also be\nhuman feedback mechanism can also be included. So this way you are able to\nincluded. So this way you are able to\nincluded. So this way you are able to solve a very complex workflow. In my\nsolve a very complex workflow. In my\nsolve a very complex workflow. In my recent uh live session, I gave a\nrecent uh live session, I gave a\nrecent uh live session, I gave a hackathon wherein you have to probably\nhackathon wherein you have to probably\nhackathon wherein you have to probably implement the entire software\nimplement the entire software\nimplement the entire software development life cycle with the help of\ndevelopment life cycle with the help of\ndevelopment life cycle with the help of human\nhuman\nhuman feedback with with the help of this\nfeedback with with the help of this\nfeedback with with the help of this entire complex workflow. So what is\nentire complex workflow. So what is\nentire complex workflow. So what is software development life cycle? First\nsoftware development life cycle? First\nsoftware development life cycle? First requirement gathering, then business\nrequirement gathering, then business\nrequirement gathering, then business understanding, then documentation, then\nunderstanding, then documentation, then\nunderstanding, then documentation, then code creation, then unit testing, then\ncode creation, then unit testing, then\ncode creation, then unit testing, then managers probably reviewing the sorry\nmanagers probably reviewing the sorry\nmanagers probably reviewing the sorry code peers reviewing the code review,\ncode peers reviewing the code review,\ncode peers reviewing the code review, providing the feedback, quality check,\nproviding the feedback, quality check,\nproviding the feedback, quality check, all those kind of check and finally\nall those kind of check and finally\nall those kind of check and finally implementing the entire software\nimplementing the entire software\nimplementing the entire software development life cycle and people\ndevelopment life cycle and people\ndevelopment life cycle and people implement it in a much more beautiful\nimplement it in a much more beautiful\nimplement it in a much more beautiful way. So here if you probably see we\nway. So here if you probably see we\nway. So here if you probably see we follow entire graph structure and this\nfollow entire graph structure and this\nfollow entire graph structure and this graph structure need not be a directed\ngraph structure need not be a directed\ngraph structure need not be a directed or cyclic graph because here my task can\nor cyclic graph because here my task can\nor cyclic graph because here my task can go from up and down it can go here and\ngo from up and down it can go here and\ngo from up and down it can go here and there right. So if you see some of the\nthere right. So if you see some of the\nthere right. So if you see some of the important differences with respect to\nimportant differences with respect to\nimportant differences with respect to the component here we use components\nthe component here we use components\nthe component here we use components like prompt lm context we use data\nlike prompt lm context we use data\nlike prompt lm context we use data injection we use persistent memory right\ninjection we use persistent memory right\ninjection we use persistent memory right here we specifically use nodes edges so\nhere we specifically use nodes edges so\nhere we specifically use nodes edges so these are nothing but these are\nthese are nothing but these are\nthese are nothing but these are nodes right these are edges edges is\nnodes right these are edges edges is\nnodes right these are edges edges is basically used for flow of the\nbasically used for flow of the\nbasically used for flow of the information and when I say stateful here\ninformation and when I say stateful here\ninformation and when I say stateful here the persistent memory is quite more\nthe persistent memory is quite more\nthe persistent memory is quite more efficient\nefficient\nefficient ient and the best part about this is\nient and the best part about this is\nient and the best part about this is that the memory is basically shared\nthat the memory is basically shared\nthat the memory is basically shared between each and every task any update\nbetween each and every task any update\nbetween each and every task any update that I'm doing in one variable this all\nthat I'm doing in one variable this all\nthat I'm doing in one variable this all nodes will be able to access those\nnodes will be able to access those\nnodes will be able to access those variables and the persistent memory is\nvariables and the persistent memory is\nvariables and the persistent memory is quite efficient in langraph right so if\nquite efficient in langraph right so if\nquite efficient in langraph right so if I talk about agentic AI application you\nI talk about agentic AI application you\nI talk about agentic AI application you may use some of the components that are\nmay use some of the components that are\nmay use some of the components that are available in the lang chain but at the\navailable in the lang chain but at the\navailable in the lang chain but at the end of the day you are building an\nend of the day you are building an\nend of the day you are building an amazing agentic application with the\namazing agentic application with the\namazing agentic application with the help of langraph\nhelp of langraph\nhelp of langraph Right. Other than that there are some\nRight. Other than that there are some\nRight. Other than that there are some more differences which you can probably\nmore differences which you can probably\nmore differences which you can probably find out over here. So these are some of\nfind out over here. So these are some of\nfind out over here. So these are some of the important components. As I said with\nthe important components. As I said with\nthe important components. As I said with respect to persistent memory this is\nrespect to persistent memory this is\nrespect to persistent memory this is much more sufficient efficient. Here we\nmuch more sufficient efficient. Here we\nmuch more sufficient efficient. Here we just use a sequential order. Here it\njust use a sequential order. Here it\njust use a sequential order. Here it need not be a sequential order to solve\nneed not be a sequential order to solve\nneed not be a sequential order to solve any kind of use cases. Right? And here\nany kind of use cases. Right? And here\nany kind of use cases. Right? And here we also understood what are the\nwe also understood what are the\nwe also understood what are the important components and here what are\nimportant components and here what are\nimportant components and here what are the important components. Right? Now the\nthe important components. Right? Now the\nthe important components. Right? Now the reason of making this specific video is\nreason of making this specific video is\nreason of making this specific video is to make your understanding very very\nto make your understanding very very\nto make your understanding very very strong. If I ask you a question, hey,\nstrong. If I ask you a question, hey,\nstrong. If I ask you a question, hey, when should we probably go ahead and use\nwhen should we probably go ahead and use\nwhen should we probably go ahead and use fine-tuning or when should we use rag or\nfine-tuning or when should we use rag or\nfine-tuning or when should we use rag or when should we probably go ahead and use\nwhen should we probably go ahead and use\nwhen should we probably go ahead and use uh let's say prompt engineering many\nuh let's say prompt engineering many\nuh let's say prompt engineering many people are not able to clearly say the\npeople are not able to clearly say the\npeople are not able to clearly say the differences right if this is the kind of\ndifferences right if this is the kind of\ndifferences right if this is the kind of question I have already made this kind\nquestion I have already made this kind\nquestion I have already made this kind of videos this videos like see in the\nof videos this videos like see in the\nof videos this videos like see in the companies now many people more than 80\ncompanies now many people more than 80\ncompanies now many people more than 80 to 90%age of the people uh in the\nto 90%age of the people uh in the\nto 90%age of the people uh in the companies are implementing efficient rag\ncompanies are implementing efficient rag\ncompanies are implementing efficient rag systems so here also you'll be able to\nsystems so here also you'll be able to\nsystems so here also you'll be able to see that when we create these are like\nsee that when we create these are like\nsee that when we create these are like traditional rags okay I'll also talk\ntraditional rags okay I'll also talk\ntraditional rags okay I'll also talk about traditional rag and agentic rag so\nabout traditional rag and agentic rag so\nabout traditional rag and agentic rag so in the traditional rag you basically\nin the traditional rag you basically\nin the traditional rag you basically create an llm right this let's say this\ncreate an llm right this let's say this\ncreate an llm right this let's say this is my llm powered ai application this\nis my llm powered ai application this\nis my llm powered ai application this will be interacting with my rag\nwill be interacting with my rag\nwill be interacting with my rag database right so this will basically be\ndatabase right so this will basically be\ndatabase right so this will basically be my rag database and this rag database\nmy rag database and this rag database\nmy rag database and this rag database will provide the context to the lm to\nwill provide the context to the lm to\nwill provide the context to the lm to finally provide the output right here if\nfinally provide the output right here if\nfinally provide the output right here if my input is basically going on\nmy input is basically going on\nmy input is basically going on So this is what is basically happening\nSo this is what is basically happening\nSo this is what is basically happening in a traditional rag. In the case of\nin a traditional rag. In the case of\nin a traditional rag. In the case of agentic rag, we create\nagentic rag, we create\nagentic rag, we create agents. We create AI agents and this\nagents. We create AI agents and this\nagents. We create AI agents and this agent is responsible whether I have to\nagent is responsible whether I have to\nagent is responsible whether I have to make a call to my database, whether I\nmake a call to my database, whether I\nmake a call to my database, whether I have to make the call to my tools or\nhave to make the call to my tools or\nhave to make the call to my tools or whether I have to take any kind of other\nwhether I have to take any kind of other\nwhether I have to take any kind of other action. Automatically this AI agents\naction. Automatically this AI agents\naction. Automatically this AI agents will be able to take that particular\nwill be able to take that particular\nwill be able to take that particular decision and provide me the response.\ndecision and provide me the response.\ndecision and provide me the response. And then probably let's say that after\nAnd then probably let's say that after\nAnd then probably let's say that after getting this information I need to go\ngetting this information I need to go\ngetting this information I need to go ahead and hit the tool and provide the\nahead and hit the tool and provide the\nahead and hit the tool and provide the get the response. This entire thing is\nget the response. This entire thing is\nget the response. This entire thing is basically implemented in the form of a\nbasically implemented in the form of a\nbasically implemented in the form of a workflow.\nworkflow.\nworkflow. Right? So this is how things basically\nRight? So this is how things basically\nRight? So this is how things basically happen. I'm soon going to make a\nhappen. I'm soon going to make a\nhappen. I'm soon going to make a detailed video on different types of rag\ndetailed video on different types of rag\ndetailed video on different types of rag which is one of the most important\nwhich is one of the most important\nwhich is one of the most important component that is currently required\ncomponent that is currently required\ncomponent that is currently required right now. Right? So I hope you like\nright now. Right? So I hope you like\nright now. Right? So I hope you like this particular video and uh this was\nthis particular video and uh this was\nthis particular video and uh this was the basic differences between langin and\nthe basic differences between langin and\nthe basic differences between langin and langraph. In the upcoming videos I'm\nlangraph. In the upcoming videos I'm\nlangraph. In the upcoming videos I'm also going to discuss about other\nalso going to discuss about other\nalso going to discuss about other frameworks. let's say crew AI agno and\nframeworks. let's say crew AI agno and\nframeworks. let's say crew AI agno and I'm going to probably go ahead and\nI'm going to probably go ahead and\nI'm going to probably go ahead and explain you all the specific things and\nexplain you all the specific things and\nexplain you all the specific things and these all things we detail explain in\nthese all things we detail explain in\nthese all things we detail explain in our live batches all the information\nour live batches all the information\nour live batches all the information will be given in the description of this\nwill be given in the description of this\nwill be given in the description of this particular video you can go ahead and\nparticular video you can go ahead and\nparticular video you can go ahead and check it out so yes uh this was it for\ncheck it out so yes uh this was it for\ncheck it out so yes uh this was it for my side I'll see you in the next video\nmy side I'll see you in the next video\nmy side I'll see you in the next video have a great day thank you and all take\nhave a great day thank you and all take\nhave a great day thank you and all take care bye-bye"

keys over here and\nrequire any kind of keys over here and when I say that I'm going to create a\nwhen I say that I'm going to create a\nwhen I say that I'm going to create a chatbot let me just go ahead and discuss\nchatbot let me just go ahead and discuss\nchatbot let me just go ahead and discuss about this architecture of the chatbot\nabout this architecture of the chatbot\nabout this architecture of the chatbot so what I'm going to create over here\nso what I'm going to create over here\nso what I'm going to create over here right so let's say that uh there's a\nright so let's say that uh there's a\nright so let's say that uh there's a chatbot over here this chatbot I will\nchatbot over here this chatbot I will\nchatbot over here this chatbot I will try to create some kind of node let's\ntry to create some kind of node let's\ntry to create some kind of node let's say this will be my start node okay\nsay this will be my start node okay\nsay this will be my start node okay whenever any user query comes you should\nwhenever any user query comes you should\nwhenever any user query comes you should be able to\nbe able to\nbe able to see that I will create a chatbot over\nsee that I will create a chatbot over\nsee that I will create a chatbot over here this chatbot can basically interact\nhere this chatbot can basically interact\nhere this chatbot can basically interact with any llm models okay and once it\nwith any llm models okay and once it\nwith any llm models okay and once it probably gives you the\nprobably gives you the\nprobably gives you the output we should end this entire flow\noutput we should end this entire flow\noutput we should end this entire flow okay so the reason why I'm drawing this\nokay so the reason why I'm drawing this\nokay so the reason why I'm drawing this in the form of graph because Lang graph\nin the form of graph because Lang graph\nin the form of graph because Lang graph also does the same thing okay so Lang\nalso does the same thing okay so Lang\nalso does the same thing okay so Lang graph also creates the entire flow in\ngraph also creates the entire flow in\ngraph also creates the entire flow in the form of graph itself where you'll\nthe form of graph itself where you'll\nthe form of graph itself where you'll have nodes and all right now there are\nhave nodes and all right now there are\nhave nodes and all right now there are two main important things when we see\ntwo main important things when we see\ntwo main important things when we see this these are specifically nodes right\nthis these are specifically nodes right\nthis these are specifically nodes right start and end node this chatbot is one\nstart and end node this chatbot is one\nstart and end node this chatbot is one node and when I write chatbot that\nnode and when I write chatbot that\nnode and when I write chatbot that basically means it is having some kind\nbasically means it is having some kind\nbasically means it is having some kind of definition right if a chatbot needs\nof definition right if a chatbot needs\nof definition right if a chatbot needs to move from one step let's say from one\nto move from one step let's say from one\nto move from one step let's say from one state to the other state we basically\nstate to the other state we basically\nstate to the other state we basically call that as a state management\ncall that as a state management\ncall that as a state management mement right so probably after executing\nmement right so probably after executing\nmement right so probably after executing this the chart bot is moving towards the\nthis the chart bot is moving towards the\nthis the chart bot is moving towards the end state so something is basically\nend state so something is basically\nend state so something is basically happening so let's go ahead and create\nhappening so let's go ahead and create\nhappening so let's go ahead and create this and then you'll be able to\nthis and then you'll be able to\nthis and then you'll be able to understand more about it okay so first\nunderstand more about it okay so first\nunderstand more about it okay so first of all we will go ahead and install pip\nof all we will go ahead and install pip\nof all we will go ahead and install pip install Lang graph so we are going to\ninstall Lang graph so we are going to\ninstall Lang graph so we are going to specifically use Lang graph Lang graph\nspecifically use Lang graph Lang graph\nspecifically use Lang graph Lang graph okay and we will also use Lang Smith so\nokay and

are\nLang graph right so here is what we are\nLang graph right so here is what we are going to basically start and this is the\ngoing to basically start and this is the\ngoing to basically start and this is the most important thing right so if I\nmost important thing right so if I\nmost important thing right so if I probably go ahead and say this okay so\nprobably go ahead and say this okay so\nprobably go ahead and say this okay so first of all uh understand there are\nfirst of all uh understand there are\nfirst of all uh understand there are multiple things which we really need to\nmultiple things which we really need to\nmultiple things which we really need to start with the importing part okay so\nstart with the importing part okay so\nstart with the importing part okay so first of all I will be importing\nfirst of all I will be importing\nfirst of all I will be importing something called as annotated right so\nsomething called as annotated right so\nsomething called as annotated right so from typing I will be importing\nfrom typing I will be importing\nfrom typing I will be importing annotated from typing extension I'll be\nannotated from typing extension I'll be\nannotated from typing extension I'll be importing type dict okay uh along with\nimporting type dict okay uh along with\nimporting type dict okay uh along with this\nthis\nthis I will be importing two important\nI will be importing two important\nI will be importing two important libraries from Lang graph so I will go\nlibraries from Lang graph so I will go\nlibraries from Lang graph so I will go ahead and write from Lang\nahead and write from Lang\nahead and write from Lang graph uh you'll understand why this\ngraph uh you'll understand why this\ngraph uh you'll understand why this importing is done just in some time okay\nimporting is done just in some time okay\nimporting is done just in some time okay from Lang\nfrom Lang\nfrom Lang graph. graph okay I'm going to just go\ngraph. graph okay I'm going to just go\ngraph. graph okay I'm going to just go ahead and import two things one is State\nahead and import two things one is State\nahead and import two things one is State graph State graph actually helps you to\ngraph State graph actually helps you to\ngraph State graph actually helps you to manage the entire State Management then\nmanage the entire State Management then\nmanage the entire State Management then your start node start node and your end\nyour start node start node and your end\nyour start node start node and your end node right your you remember that I\nnode right your you remember that I\nnode right your you remember that I actually created a uh a diagram right\nactually created a uh a diagram right\nactually created a uh a diagram right where we had a startat node then we had\nwhere we had a startat node then we had\nwhere we had a startat node then we had an end node which actually uh shows the\nan end node which actually uh shows the\nan end node which actually uh shows the flow of the entire chart bot itself okay\nflow of the entire chart bot itself okay\nflow of the entire chart bot itself okay along with this uh I will also be\nalong with this uh I will also be\nalong with this uh I will also be showing let this see the state graph is\nshowing let this see the state graph is\nshowing let this see the state graph is basically used for the State Management\nbasically used for the State Management\nbasically used for the State Management purpose now the state graph needs to\npurpose now the state graph needs to\npurpose now the state graph needs to keep on changing based on some\nkeep on changing based on some\nkeep on changing based on some parameters okay so for that what I will\nparameters okay so for that what I will\nparameters okay so for that what I will be doing I will go ahead and write from\nbe doing I will go ahead and write from\nbe doing I will go ahead and write from Lang\nLang\nLang graph langra do\ngraph langra do\ngraph langra do graph.\ngraph.\ngraph. messages message I'm just going to go\nmessages message I'm just going to go\nmessages message I'm just going to go ahead and import\nahead and import\nahead and import addore messages okay now this is one of\naddore messages okay now this is one of\naddore messages okay now this is one of the function what it does is that we\nthe function what it does is that we\nthe function what it does is that we have this something called as messages\nhave this something called as messages\nhave this something called as messages right as we keep on adding the messages\nright as we keep on adding the messages\nright as we keep on adding the messages over here we will be able to see that\nover here we will be able to see that\nover here we will be able to see that our state management our state of the\nour state management our state of the\nour state management our state of the agent will keep on changing now this\nagent will keep on changing now this\nagent will keep on changing now this messages is just like you can understand\nmessages is just like you can understand\nmessages is just like you can understand like when a user is giving a query the\nlike when a user is giving a query the\nlike when a user is giving a query the llm model is giving a response when it\nllm model is giving a response when it\nllm model is giving a response when it is giving a response the message will\nis giving a response the message will\nis giving a response the message will get added over here and then my state of\nget added over here and then my state of\nget added over here and then my state of the chat bot will also get changed right\nthe chat bot will also get changed right\nthe chat bot will also get changed right so this messages is basically keeping\nso this messages is basically keeping\nso this messages is basically keeping the track of all those things okay so\nthe track of all those

start our graph building process so here\nstart our graph building process so here\nstart our graph building process so here I'm going to use State graph the state\nI'm going to use State graph the state\nI'm going to use State graph the state graph which I have actually imported it\ngraph which I have actually imported it\ngraph which I have actually imported it over here and this state graph will have\nover here and this state graph will have\nover here and this state graph will have this particular class which is called as\nthis particular class which is called as\nthis particular class which is called as state because this state knows which\nstate because this state knows which\nstate because this state knows which messages are there what messages are\nmessages are there what

you can see Lang\nover here right so here you can see Lang\nover here right so here you can see Lang graph. graph. state state graph at this\ngraph. graph. state state graph at this\ngraph. graph. state state graph at this specific location so guys now after we\nspecific location so guys now after we\nspecific location so guys now after we have created the graph Builder uh what\nhave created the graph Builder uh what\nhave created the graph Builder uh what we are basically going to do is that uh\nwe are basically going to do is that uh\nwe are basically going to do is that uh already in this diagram you saw that\nalready in this diagram you saw that\nalready in this diagram you saw that right we are going to create this\nright we are going to create this\nright we are going to create this chatbot now this chatbot should be\nchatbot now this chatbot should be\nchatbot now this chatbot should be interacting with our llm so for this we\ninteracting with our llm so for this we\ninteracting with our llm so for this we will go ahead and write some definition\nwill go ahead and write some definition\nwill go ahead and write some definition so let's quickly go ahead\nso let's quickly go ahead\nso let's quickly go ahead and uh create a function definition\nand uh create a function definition\nand uh create a function definition chatbot and remember whenever

the user message and this should have the llm\nmessage and this should have the llm\nmessage and this should have the llm model respon uh response so let me go\nmodel respon uh response so let me go\nmodel respon uh response so let me go ahead and execute\nahead and execute\nahead and execute it so I will go ahead and write hello\nit so I will go ahead and write hello\nit so I will go ahead

help you see all\nright hello how can I help you see all these messages are basically coming in\nthese messages are basically coming in\nthese messages are basically coming in the form of Dick value right so here uh\nthe form of Dick value right so here uh\nthe form of Dick value right so here uh hello how can I help you today is the\nhello how can I help you today is the\nhello how can I help you today is the response and I'm able to get so let me\nresponse and I'm able to get so let me\nresponse and I'm able to get so let me go ahead and ask what is J\ngo ahead and ask what is J\ngo ahead and ask what is J AI right so here you'll be able to see\nAI right so here you'll be able to see\nAI right so here you'll be able to see that all the response is there right\nthat all the response is there right\nthat all the response is there right geni is a type of artificial\ngeni is a type of artificial\ngeni is a type of artificial intelligence think of it so it's amazing\nintelligence think of it so it's amazing\nintelligence think of it so it's amazing right you're able to get the entire\nright you're able to get the entire\nright you're able to get the entire response and here also you can see\nresponse and here also you can see\nresponse and here also you can see response metadata content is over here\nresponse metadata content is over here\nresponse metadata content is over here so if you just go ahead and explore this\nso if you just go ahead and explore this\nso if you just go ahead and explore this some of the other keys will be available\nsome of the other keys will be available\nsome of the other keys will be available over here\nover here\nover here right and\nright and\nright and uh uh if you go ahead and see down so\nuh uh if you go ahead and see down so\nuh uh if you go ahead and see down so this is my entire generative message so\nthis is my entire generative message so\nthis is my entire generative message so if I just go ahead and write Q it should\nif I just go ahead and write Q it should\nif I just go ahead and write Q it should be exiting over here right so here you\nbe exiting over here right so here you\nbe exiting over here right so here you can see it says goodbye so guys I hope\ncan see it says goodbye so guys I hope\ncan see it says goodbye so guys I hope you like this specific video uh and you\nyou like this specific video uh and you\nyou like this specific video uh and you were able to understand how to basically\nwere able to understand how to basically\nwere able to understand how to basically create a simple chatbot in the form

I'd recommend checking\nlanguage and I'd recommend checking those out if you haven't what we're\nthose out if you haven't what we're\nthose out if you haven't what we're doing with Lang graph is we're making it\ndoing with Lang graph is we're making it\ndoing with Lang graph is we're making it easy to customize the agent runtime so\neasy to customize the agent runtime so\neasy to customize the agent runtime so previously the agent runtime was always\npreviously the agent runtime was always\npreviously the agent runtime was always the agent EX class and this was\nthe agent EX class and this was\nthe agent EX class and this was basically something that ran in a loop\nbasically something that ran in a loop\nbasically something that ran in a loop and and called uh Tools in a specific\nand and called uh Tools in a specific\nand and called uh Tools in a specific way and and handled errors in a specific\nway and and handled errors in a specific\nway and and handled errors in a specific way and that was great but it was just\nway and that was great but it was just\nway and that was great but it was just one way to create this runtime and so we\none way to create this runtime and so we\none way to create this runtime and so we want to create more ways to create this\nwant to create more ways to create this\nwant to create more ways to create this runtime and ways to create them more\nruntime and ways to create them more\nruntime and ways to create them more flexibly and\nflexibly and\nflexibly and dynamically and a key part of this\ndynamically and a key part of this\ndynamically and a key part of this runtime is the ability to add Cycles so\nruntime is the ability to add Cycles so\nruntime is the ability to add Cycles so you know the whole point of the agent\nyou know the whole point of the agent\nyou know the whole point of the agent runtime is running this agent this llm\nruntime is running this agent this llm\nruntime is running this agent this llm powered agent in a loop and so you need\npowered agent in a loop and so you need\npowered agent in a loop and so you need to be able to have cycles and Lang chain\nto be able to have cycles and Lang chain\nto be able to have cycles and Lang chain expression language and other uh you\nexpression language and other uh you\nexpression language and other uh you know dag likee Frameworks are non\nknow dag likee Frameworks are non\nknow dag likee Frameworks are non they're not cyclical um and so that's\nthey're not cyclical um and so that's\nthey're not cyclical um and so that's what we're introducing L graph for um\nwhat we're introducing L graph for um\nwhat we're introducing L graph for um it's it's a way to create these cyclical\nit's it's a way to create these cyclical\nit's it's a way to create these cyclical agent run\nagent run\nagent run times so that's hopefully an overview of\ntimes so that's hopefully an overview of\ntimes so that's hopefully an overview of what Lang graph is and and why we\nwhat Lang graph is and and why we\nwhat Lang graph is and and why we created it the rest of the videos in\ncreated it the rest of the videos in\ncreated it the rest of the videos in this series are going to focus on two of\nthis series are going to focus on two of\nthis series are going to focus on two of the main agent run times that we've\nthe main agent run times that we've\nthe main agent run times that we've added to start so first we've added a\nadded to start so first we've added a\nadded to start so first we've added a agent executor very similar to the agent\nagent executor very similar to the agent\nagent executor very similar to the agent executor in uh laying chain so we've\nexecutor in uh laying chain so we've\nexecutor in uh laying chain so we've recreated that agent executor with L\nrecreated that agent executor with L\nrecreated that agent executor with L graph and then we've added a chat agent\ngraph and then we've added a chat agent\ngraph and then we've added a chat agent executor the chat agent executive takes\nexecutor the chat agent executive takes\nexecutor the chat agent executive takes in a list of messages and then\nin a list of messages and then\nin a list of messages and then represents the agent State just as a\nrepresents the agent State just as a\nrepresents the agent State just as a list of messages and so it returns a\nlist of messages and so it returns a\nlist of messages and so it returns a list of messages as well the reason we\nlist of messages as well the reason we\nlist of messages as well the reason we did this is that a lot of the newer\ndid this is that a lot of the newer\ndid this is that a lot of the newer models are chat-based models and they\nmodels are chat-based models and they\nmodels are chat-based models and they intrinsically represent function calling\nintrinsically represent function calling\nintrinsically represent function calling um as as basically parameters of part of\num as as basically parameters of part of\num as as basically parameters of part of a message and then they also have uh\na message and then they also have uh\na message and then they also have uh function responses being a separate type\nfunction responses being a separate type\nfunction responses being a separate type of message and so representing this\nof message and so representing

natural for these types of models\nvery natural for these types of models and so we've added a separate agent\nand so we've added a separate agent\nand so we've added a separate agent executor particularly for that then I'm\nexecutor particularly for that then I'm\nexecutor particularly for that then I'm going to highlight a bunch of different\ngoing to highlight a bunch of different\ngoing

we\none way to create this runtime and so we want to create more ways to create this\nwant to create more ways to create this\nwant to create more ways to create this runtime and ways to create them more\nruntime and ways to create them more\nruntime and ways to create them more flexibly and\nflexibly and\nflexibly and dynamically and a key part of this\ndynamically and a key part of

llm powered agent in a loop and so you need\npowered agent in a loop and so you need\npowered agent in a loop and so you need to be able to have cycles and Lang chain\nto be able to have cycles and Lang chain\nto be able to have cycles and Lang chain expression language and other uh you\nexpression language and other uh you\nexpression language and other uh you know dag likee Frameworks are non\nknow dag likee Frameworks are non\nknow dag likee Frameworks are non they're not cyclical um and so that's\nthey're not cyclical um and so that's\nthey're not cyclical um and so that's what we're

that we've\nthe main agent run times that we've added to start so first we've added a\nadded to start so first we've added a\nadded to start so first we've added a agent executor very similar to the

we've recreated that agent executor with L\nrecreated that agent executor with L\nrecreated that agent executor with L graph and then we've added a chat agent\ngraph and then we've added a chat

then\nin a list of messages and then\nin a list of messages and then represents the agent State just as a\nrepresents the agent State just as a\nrepresents the agent State just as a list of messages and so it returns a\nlist of messages and so it returns a\nlist of messages and so it returns a list of messages as well the reason we\nlist of messages as well the reason we\nlist of messages as well the reason we did this is that a lot of the newer\ndid this is that a lot of the newer\ndid this is that a lot of the newer models are chat-based models and they\nmodels are chat-based models and they\nmodels are chat-based models and they intrinsically represent function calling\nintrinsically represent function calling\nintrinsically represent function calling um as as basically parameters

have uh function responses being a separate type\nfunction responses being a separate type\nfunction responses being a separate type of message and so representing this\nof message and so representing

runs that agent in a loop\nbasically runs that agent in a loop calls that agent decides what action to\ncalls that agent decides what action to\ncalls that agent decides what action to take then takes that action and then get\ntake then takes that action and then get\ntake then takes that action and then get records the observation and then passes\nrecords the observation and then passes\nrecords the observation and then passes that back in and starts to Loop over\nthat back in and starts to Loop over\nthat back in and starts to Loop over again and continues going through that\nagain and continues going through that\nagain and continues going through that Loop until the agent decides that it is\nLoop until the agent decides that it is\nLoop until the agent decides that it is finished so we've made it easy over the\nfinished so we've made it easy over the\nfinished so we've made it easy over the past few months to customize agents in\npast few months to customize agents in\npast few months to customize agents in Lang chain with Lang chain expression\nLang chain with Lang chain expression\nLang chain with Lang chain expression language and I'd recommend checking\nlanguage and I'd recommend checking\nlanguage and I'd recommend checking those out if you haven't what we're\nthose out if you haven't what we're\nthose out if you haven't what we're doing with Lang graph is we're making it\ndoing with Lang graph is we're making it\ndoing with Lang graph is we're making it easy to customize the agent runtime so\neasy to customize the agent runtime so\neasy to customize the agent runtime so previously the agent runtime was always\npreviously the agent runtime was always\npreviously the agent runtime was always the agent EX class and this was\nthe agent EX class and this was\nthe agent EX class and this was basically something that ran in a loop\nbasically something that ran in a loop\nbasically something that ran in a loop and and called uh Tools in a specific\nand and called uh Tools in a specific\nand and called uh Tools in a specific way and and handled errors in a specific\nway and and handled errors in a specific\nway and and handled errors in a specific way and that was great but it was just\nway and that was great but it was just\nway and that was great but it was just one way to create this runtime and so we\none way to create this runtime and so we\none way to create this runtime and so we want to create more ways to create this\nwant to create more ways to create this\nwant to create more ways to create this runtime and ways to create them more\nruntime and ways to create them more\nruntime and ways to create them more flexibly and\nflexibly and\nflexibly and dynamically and a key part of this\ndynamically and a key part of this\ndynamically and a key part of this runtime is the ability to add Cycles so\nruntime is the ability to add Cycles so\nruntime is the ability to add Cycles so you know the whole point of the agent\nyou know the whole point of the agent\nyou know the whole point of the agent runtime is running this agent this llm\nruntime is running this agent this llm\nruntime is running this agent this llm powered agent in a loop and so you need\npowered agent in a loop and so you need\npowered agent in a loop and so you need to be able to have cycles and Lang chain\nto be able to have cycles and Lang chain\nto be able to have cycles and Lang chain expression language and other uh you\nexpression language and other uh you\nexpression language and other uh you know dag likee Frameworks are non\nknow dag likee Frameworks are non\nknow dag likee Frameworks are non they're not cyclical um and so that's\nthey're not cyclical um and so that's\nthey're not cyclical um and so that's what we're introducing L graph for um\nwhat we're introducing L graph for um\nwhat we're introducing L graph for um it's it's a way to create these cyclical\nit's it's a way to create these cyclical\nit's it's a way to create these cyclical agent run\nagent run\nagent run times so that's hopefully an overview of\ntimes so that's hopefully an overview of\ntimes so that's hopefully an overview of what Lang graph is and and why we\nwhat Lang graph is and and why we\nwhat Lang graph is and and why we created it the rest of the videos in\ncreated it the rest of the videos in\ncreated it the rest of the videos in this series are going to focus on two of\nthis series are going to focus on two of\nthis series are going to focus on two of the main agent run times that we've\nthe main agent run times that we've\nthe main agent run times that we've added to start so first we've added a\nadded to start so first we've added a\nadded to start so first we've added a agent executor very similar to the agent\nagent executor very similar to the agent\nagent executor very similar to the agent executor in uh laying chain so we've\nexecutor in uh laying chain so we've\nexecutor in uh laying chain so we've recreated that agent executor with L\nrecreated that agent executor with L\nrecreated that agent executor with L graph and then we've added a chat agent\ngraph and then we've added a chat agent\ngraph and then we've added a chat agent executor the chat agent executive takes\nexecutor the chat agent executive takes\nexecutor the chat agent executive takes in a list of messages and then\nin a list of messages and then\nin a list of messages and then represents the agent State just as a\nrepresents the agent State just as a\nrepresents the agent State just as a list of messages and so it returns a\nlist of messages and so it returns a\nlist of messages and so it returns a list of messages as well the reason we\nlist of messages as well the reason we\nlist of messages as well the reason we did this is that a lot of the newer\ndid this is that a lot of the newer\ndid this is that a lot of the newer models are chat-based models and they\nmodels are chat-based models and they\nmodels are chat-based models and they intrinsically represent function calling\nintrinsically represent function calling\nintrinsically represent function calling um as as basically parameters of part of\num as as basically parameters of part of\num as as basically parameters of part of a message and then they also have uh\na message and then they also have uh\na message and then they also have uh function responses being a separate type\nfunction responses being a separate type\nfunction responses being a separate type of message and so representing this\nof message and so representing this\nof message and so representing this agent State as a list of messages is\nagent State as a list of messages is\nagent State as a list of messages is very natural for these types of models\nvery natural for these types of models\nvery natural for these types of models and so we've added a separate agent\nand so we've added a separate agent\nand so we've added a separate agent executor particularly for that then I'm\nexecutor particularly for that then I'm\nexecutor particularly for that then I'm going to highlight a bunch of different\ngoing to highlight a bunch of different\ngoing to highlight a bunch of different ways that you can modify the base agent\nways that you can modify the base agent\nways that you can modify the base agent executors to do things like add human in\nexecutors to do things like add human in\nexecutors to do things like add human in the loops um force uh specific tool to\nthe loops um force uh specific tool to\nthe loops um force uh specific tool to be called First and other exciting\nbe called First and other exciting\nbe called First and other exciting things like that hope you\nthings like that hope you\nthings like that hope you
