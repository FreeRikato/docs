only you the browser also uses\nand not only you the browser also uses\nand not only you the browser also uses the single place to log messages\nthe single place to log messages\nthe single place to log messages now this message could be anything right\nnow this message could be anything right\nnow this message could be anything right it could be a network request failure\nit could be a network request failure\nit could be a network request failure it could be a javascript code syntax\nit could be a javascript code syntax\nit could be a javascript code syntax error it could be a runtime error\nerror it could be a runtime error\nerror it could be a runtime error it could be pretty much anything right\nit could be pretty much anything right\nit could be pretty much anything right which is an error a warning maybe just\nwhich is an error a warning maybe just\nwhich is an error a warning maybe just success messages as well if you want to\nsuccess messages as well if you want to\nsuccess messages as well if you want to log\nlog\nlog but the most common use case of console\nbut the most common use case of console\nbut the most common use case of console is for dumping information\nis for dumping information\nis for dumping information so let's just go ahead and create a\nso let's just go ahead and create a\nso let's just go ahead and create a button in html real quick\nbutton in html real quick\nbutton in html real quick so i'm going to create this button\nso i'm going to create this button\nso i'm going to create this button and i'm just going to say\nand i'm just going to say\nand i'm just going to say click me to this and i'm gonna give this\nclick me to this and i'm gonna give this\nclick me to this and i'm gonna give this an\nan\nan on click of uh\non click of uh\non click of uh you know log something\nyou know log something\nyou know log something and if i just go ahead and include this\nand if i just go ahead and include this\nand if i just go ahead and include this function right here log something and\nfunction right here log something and\nfunction right here log something and just write console.log\njust write console.log\njust write console.log math.random right and if i go ahead\nmath.random right and if i go ahead\nmath.random right and if i go ahead and refresh this page now and if i click\nand refresh this page now and if i click\nand refresh this page now and if i click on this\non this\non this well you have to call it like this it's\nwell you have to call it like this it's\nwell you have to call it like this it's not like react or something\nnot like react or something\nnot like react or something but anyway once i refresh this again and\nbut anyway once i refresh this again and\nbut anyway once i refresh this again and if i click on this you can see\nif i click on this you can see\nif i click on this you can see that we get a random number uh in the\nthat we get a random number uh in the\nthat we get a random number uh in the console\nconsole\nconsole so you see this is the place where you\nso you see this is the place where you\nso you see this is the place where you get console logs\nget console logs\nget console logs of the scripts which you are you know\nof the scripts which you are you know\nof the scripts which you are you know which is executing number one\nwhich is executing number one\nwhich is executing number one number two with every console log it\nnumber two with every console log it\nnumber two with every console log it actually gives you the location or at\nactually gives you the location or at\nactually gives you the location or at least tries to give you the location\nleast tries to give you the location\nleast tries to give you the location of which file generated it right so if\nof which file generated it right so if\nof which file generated it right so if you click on this\nyou click on this\nyou click on this see that a new tab sources opens up and\nsee that a new tab sources opens up and\nsee that a new tab sources opens up and the sources highlights the exact line\nthe sources highlights the exact line\nthe sources highlights the exact line number\nnumber\nnumber which is responsible for that console\nwhich is responsible for that console\nwhich is responsible for that console right\nright\nright so for example if i go ahead let me see\nso for example if i go ahead let me see\nso for example if i go ahead let me see if i can see\nif i can see\nif i can see something if i go ahead on the main\nsomething if i go ahead on the

really help\nyou can see that it does not really help a lot\na lot\na lot sometimes because on production sites\nsometimes because on production sites\nsometimes because on production sites you're going to see most of the code is\nyou're going to see most of the code is\nyou're going to see most of the code is obfuscated\nobfuscated\nobfuscated but we see if these are the errors if i\nbut we see if these are the errors if i\nbut we see if these are the errors if i click on this\nclick on this\nclick on this index or maybe like index 658 you're\nindex or maybe like index 658 you're\nindex or maybe like index 658 you're gonna see\ngonna see\ngonna see well this one this one is sort of like a\nwell this one this one is sort of like a\nwell this one this one is sort of like a not the correct one but in most of the\nnot the correct one but in most of the\nnot the correct one but in most of the cases\ncases\ncases let's see well this is because like\nlet's see well this is because like\nlet's see well this is because like it's mostly compressed code as well\nit's mostly compressed code as well\nit's mostly compressed code as well right so sometimes things get\nright so sometimes things get\nright so sometimes things get fuzzy there but what you can remember is\nfuzzy there but what you can remember is\nfuzzy there but what you can remember is that when you're writing code when\nthat when you're writing code when\nthat when you're writing code when you're writing simple code\nyou're writing simple code\nyou're writing simple code it actually gives you the file number\nit actually gives you the file number\nit actually gives you the file number file line number with the file name with\nfile line number with the file name with\nfile line number with the file name with it right so that's pretty cool\nit right so that's pretty cool\nit right so that's pretty cool if you want to just jump directly into\nif you want to just jump directly into\nif you want to just jump directly into it right so if i can click on this\nit right so if i can click on this\nit right so if i can click on this you can see that it it just tells me\nyou can see that it it just tells me\nyou can see that it it just tells me directly that hey this is the file this\ndirectly that hey this is the file this\ndirectly that hey this is the file this is the line number which

diving deep into like all these things filters default levels\nall these things filters default levels\nall these things filters default levels just going through a little bit of\njust going through a little bit of\njust going through a little bit of what everything does and just making you\nwhat everything does and just making you\nwhat everything does and just making you comfortable with it\ncomfortable with it\ncomfortable with it so that is all for this one i'm gonna\nso that is all for this one i'm gonna\nso that is all for this one i'm gonna see you in the next video\nsee you in the next video\nsee you in the next video hey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this video let's just go ahead and take a\nvideo let's just go ahead and take a\nvideo let's just go ahead and take a quick look at\nquick look at\nquick look at what all you can do with consoles and\nwhat all you can do with consoles and\nwhat all you can do with consoles and obviously we have seen you can\nobviously we have seen you can\nobviously we have seen you can console.log with a simple button click\nconsole.log with a simple button click\nconsole.log with a simple button click but let us go a little bit deep into\nbut let us go a little bit deep into\nbut let us go a little bit deep into what all is achievable\nwhat all is achievable\nwhat all is achievable with the you know simple console log\nwith the you know simple console log\nwith the you know simple console log statements\nstatements\nstatements why because console is sort of just a\nwhy because console is sort of just a\nwhy because console is sort of just a way in javascript to interact\nway in javascript to interact\nway in javascript to interact with the the sending locks to the\nwith the the sending locks to the\nwith the the sending locks to the console but you can actually customize\nconsole but you can actually customize\nconsole but you can actually customize them a lot\nthem a lot\nthem a lot right so i'm going to click on the first\nright so i'm going to click on the first\nright so i'm going to click on the first button login for you know it's just a\nbutton login for you know it's just a\nbutton login for you know it's just a regular console log\nregular console log\nregular console log just like you would expect and if i go\njust like you would expect and if i go\njust like you would expect and if i go ahead and take a look at this thing\nahead and take a look at this thing\nahead and take a look at this thing which we mentioned in the last one\nwhich we mentioned in the last one\nwhich we mentioned in the last one you can see that we directly get to the\nyou can see that we directly get to the\nyou can see that we directly get to the line which is responsible for generating\nline which is responsible for generating\nline which is responsible for generating this log\nthis log\nthis log and that is the slide number two on\nand that is the slide number two on\nand that is the slide number two on clicking the first button\nclicking the first button\nclicking the first button right then if i go to console and click\nright then if i go to console and click\nright then if i go to console and click on log warning you're going to see that\non log warning you're going to see that\non log warning you're going to see that the warnings\nthe warnings\nthe warnings are locked in a different way and the\nare locked in a different way and the\nare locked in a different way and the way you log a warning\nway you log a warning\nway you log a warning is you just write console.1 instead of\nis you just write console.1 instead of\nis you just write console.1 instead of console.log\nconsole.log\nconsole.log and you just write hello123 or whatever\nand you just write hello123 or whatever\nand you just write hello123 or whatever you want and you can see that's how it\nyou want and you can see that's how it\nyou want and you can see that's how it becomes a sort of a special thing right\nbecomes a sort of a special thing right\nbecomes a sort of a special thing right so right now you can also see that you\nso right now you can also see that you\nso right now you can also see that you can use console as a ripple\ncan use console as a ripple\ncan use console as a ripple that means as a read evaluate print and\nthat means as a read evaluate print and\nthat means as a read evaluate print and loop\nloop\nloop sort of thing so you can write stuff\nsort of thing so you can write stuff\nsort of thing so you can write stuff here you can you know you can actually\nhere you can you know you can actually\nhere you can you know you can actually execute javascript code\nexecute javascript code\nexecute javascript code so you can write document.getelementbyid\nso you can write document.getelementbyid\nso you can write document.getelementbyid stuff like this you can do all of that\nstuff like this you can do all of that\nstuff like this you can do all of that right so this is a very powerful\nright so this is a very powerful\nright so this is a very powerful debugging place\ndebugging place\ndebugging place now let's move on to log error so you\nnow let's move on to log error so you\nnow let's move on to log error so you can see that the errors are logged just\ncan see that the errors are logged just\ncan see that the errors are logged just like\nlike\nlike red just like we saw earlier on the main\nred just like we saw earlier on the main\nred just like we saw earlier on the main website and you can still jump to them\nwebsite and you can still jump to them\nwebsite and you can still jump to them how they uh sort of you know they get\nhow they uh sort of you know they get\nhow they uh sort of you know they get underlined and all that stuff\nunderlined and all that stuff\nunderlined and all that stuff so you can see console.error makes it\nso you can see console.error makes it\nso you can see console.error makes it look\nlook\nlook as as a sort of reddish thing\nas as a sort of reddish thing\nas as a sort of reddish thing right again sort of there for you to get\nright again sort of there for you to get\nright again sort of there for you to get your\nyour\nyour attention to that you have to address\nattention to that you have to address\nattention to that you have to address the errors then there are some special\nthe errors then there are some special\nthe errors then there are some special console logs which are just for utility\nconsole logs which are just for utility\nconsole logs which are just for utility based\nbased\nbased to be honest you as a independent\nto be honest you as a independent\nto be honest you as a independent developer would not really use them but\ndeveloper would not really use them but\ndeveloper would not really use them but if you're a library developer or\nif you're a library developer or\nif you're a library developer or somebody who's you know working on a\nsomebody who's you know working on a\nsomebody who's you know working on a debugging\ndebugging\ndebugging sort of place of plugins or something\nsort of place of plugins or something\nsort of place of plugins or something then you might\nthen you might\nthen you might use stuff like log table right so if you\nuse stuff like log table right so if you\nuse stuff like log table right so if you click on this\nclick on this\nclick on this you can see that it locks an\nyou can see that it locks an\nyou can see that it locks an array of values in a nice format right\narray of values in a nice format right\narray of values in a nice format right so if you have an array of values and if\nso if you have an array of values and if\nso if you have an array of values and if you want to log it\nyou want to log it\nyou want to log it this is the statement which generated it\nthis is the statement which generated it\nthis is the statement which generated it by the way\nby the way\nby the way so if you want to log it you can sure go\nso if you want to log it you can sure go\nso if you want to log it you can sure go ahead and log it like a regular array\nahead and log it like a regular array\nahead and log it like a regular array which will\nwhich will\nwhich will which will appear something like this\nwhich will appear something like this\nwhich will appear something like this but\nbut\nbut chrome can do a better job of creating a\nchrome can do a better job of creating a\nchrome can do a better job of creating a table out of it within the console\ntable out of it within the console\ntable out of it within the console so you can do that right then if you\nso you can do that right then if you\nso you can do that right then if you click on log\nclick on log\nclick on log group you can see a similar sort of\ngroup you can see a similar sort of\ngroup you can see a similar sort of thing with log group as well so if i go\nthing with log group as well so if i go\nthing with log group as well so if i go ahead and click on this\nahead and click on this\nahead and click on this you can see that we have a console.group\nyou can see that we have a console.group\nyou can see that we have a console.group starting off with a label\nstarting off with a label\nstarting off with a label and then we have a console.group end\nand then we have a console.group end\nand then we have a console.group end it's sort of like a you know a little\nit's sort of like a you know a little\nit's sort of like a you know a little bit of customization here and there if\nbit of customization here and there if\nbit of customization here and there if you want you can collapse this group if\nyou want you can collapse this group if\nyou want you can collapse this group if you want\nyou want\nyou want you know if you want to become extremely\nyou know if you want to become extremely\nyou know if you want to become extremely tidy and nice with your console logs\ntidy and nice with your console logs\ntidy and nice with your console logs this then this is something you can do\nthis then this is something you can do\nthis then this is something you can do right\nright\nright um but to be honest you're not really\num but to be honest you're not really\num but to be honest you're not really going to use this a lot of times as a\ngoing to use this a lot of times as a\ngoing to use this a lot of times as a developer\ndeveloper\ndeveloper then let's just log custom and you can\nthen let's just log custom and you can\nthen let's just log custom and you can see that you can actually use\nsee that you can actually use\nsee that you can actually use css in the console which is a pretty\ncss in the console which is a pretty\ncss in the console which is a pretty cool thing\ncool thing\ncool thing right and this sort of like deserves a\nright and this sort of like deserves a\nright and this sort of like deserves a video of its own\nvideo of its own\nvideo of its own but how you do that let me actually just\nbut how you do that let me actually just\nbut how you do that let me actually just go ahead and show you in the file\ngo ahead and show you in the file\ngo ahead and show you in the file the way you do that is you\nthe way you do that is you\nthe way you do that is you first of all create a styles string\nfirst of all create a styles string\nfirst of all create a styles string how your css should look like and then\nhow your css should look like and then\nhow your css should look like and then you just console log it regularly but\nyou just console log it regularly but\nyou just console log it regularly but you inject the styles with the\nyou inject the styles with the\nyou inject the styles with the percentage c\npercentage c\npercentage c and then pass the second one as the\nand then pass the second one as the\nand then pass the second one as the styles right\nstyles right\nstyles right so console.log sort of like accepts\nso console.log sort of like accepts\nso console.log sort of like accepts the way the strings are parsed uh\nthe way the strings are parsed uh\nthe way the strings are parsed uh passed as a cs inside of a c or c plus\npassed as a cs inside of a c or c plus\npassed as a cs inside of a c or c plus plus library\nplus library\nplus library for example i can do something like you\nfor example i can do something like you\nfor example i can do something like you know console.log\nknow console.log\nknow console.log s and yay something like this and you're\ns and yay something like this and you're\ns and yay something like this and you're gonna see that percentage s does not\ngonna see that percentage s does not\ngonna see that percentage s does not appear\nappear\nappear right similarly you can do console.log\nright similarly you can do console.log\nright similarly you can do console.log d and one something like this and it\nd and one something like this and it\nd and one something like this and it appears not a number because this is not\nappears not a number because this is not\nappears not a number because this is not a number right so it's smart enough to\na number right so it's smart enough to\na number right so it's smart enough to parse that\nparse that\nparse that and now you can see the ps1 so in a\nand now you can see the ps1 so in a\nand now you can see the ps1 so in a similar way if you want to parse some\nsimilar way if you want to parse some\nsimilar way if you want to parse some css\ncss\ncss you can say hello and then you can go\nyou can say hello and then you can go\nyou can say hello and then you can go ahead and specify a css string like this\nahead and specify a css string like this\nahead and specify a css string like this right\nright\nright so i can just say font size 20 pixel\nso i can just say font size 20 pixel\nso i can just say font size 20 pixel something like that\nsomething like that\nsomething like that so you can see that's how it works so\nso you can see that's how it works so\nso you can see that's how it works so again you can do that and you can see it\nagain you can do that and you can see it\nagain you can do that and you can see it within the console\nwithin the console\nwithin the console cause 404 okay\ncause 404 okay\ncause 404 okay you can see it's sort of like request\nyou can see it's sort of like request\nyou can see it's sort of like request makes a network request we're gonna do\nmakes a network request we're gonna do\nmakes a network request we're gonna do more of that\nmore of that\nmore of that but you can you can see like you know\nbut you can you can see like you know\nbut you can you can see like you know what cost 404\nwhat cost 404\nwhat cost 404 then cause error sort of causes an error\nthen cause error sort of causes an error\nthen cause error sort of causes an error which gives you a stack trace as well\nwhich gives you a stack trace as well\nwhich gives you a stack trace as well but it's basically a just a single stack\nbut it's basically a just a single stack\nbut it's basically a just a single stack trace in this case because\ntrace in this case because\ntrace in this case because obviously it's not a major error causing\nobviously it's not a major error causing\nobviously it's not a major error causing you know chained up to multiple\nyou know chained up to multiple\nyou know chained up to multiple functions and cause violation\nfunctions and cause violation\nfunctions and cause violation is hidden from you and the reason for\nis hidden from you and the reason for\nis hidden from you and the reason for that\nthat\nthat is that violations do not come under\nis that violations do not come under\nis that violations do not come under default levels\ndefault levels\ndefault levels right so if you just go ahead and enable\nright so if you just go ahead and enable\nright so if you just go ahead and enable the verbose logging\nthe verbose logging\nthe verbose logging then you're going to see this violation\nthen you're going to see this violation\nthen you're going to see this violation right and if you go ahead and click on\nright and if you go ahead and click on\nright and if you go ahead and click on this you can see that we create a\nthis you can see that we create a\nthis you can see that we create a violation\nviolation\nviolation sort of like this right you know\nsort of like this right you know\nsort of like this right you know it's just sort of a hackish way to do\nit's just sort of a hackish way to do\nit's just sort of a hackish way to do that\nthat\nthat but the way it works is by default the\nbut the way it works is by default the\nbut the way it works is by default the bose logging is off why because verbose\nbose logging is off why because verbose\nbose logging is off why because verbose logging just creates too much noise in\nlogging just creates too much noise in\nlogging just creates too much noise in the console and a lot of time you don't\nthe console and a lot of time you don't\nthe console and a lot of time you don't really need that\nreally need that\nreally need that one quick information um if you want to\none quick information um if you want to\none quick information um if you want to sort of know that and that is that\nsort of know that and that is that\nsort of know that and that is that console.info\nconsole.info\nconsole.info actually logs in the verbose section so\nactually logs in the verbose section so\nactually logs in the verbose section so i can say hello there\ni can say hello there\ni can say hello there right here and no no no\nright here and no no no\nright here and no no no not info console.debug yeah\nnot info console.debug yeah\nnot info console.debug yeah console.debug hello there\nconsole.debug hello there\nconsole.debug hello there and you can see it does not appear here\nand you can see it does not appear here\nand you can see it does not appear here why because it has gone into our boost\nwhy because it has gone into our boost\nwhy because it has gone into our boost logging\nlogging\nlogging and you can see that it says one hidden\nand you can see that it says one hidden\nand you can see that it says one hidden here because it knows that something was\nhere because it knows that something was\nhere because it knows that something was logged and it was not visible\nlogged and it was not visible\nlogged and it was not visible so if you click on this virbose you can\nso if you click on this virbose you can\nso if you click on this virbose you can see that hello there appears\nsee that hello there appears\nsee that hello there appears now because now your logging is 100\nnow because now your logging is 100\nnow because now your logging is 100 you might think that this is a good idea\nyou might think that this is a good idea\nyou might think that this is a good idea to enable verbose logging all the time\nto enable verbose logging all the time\nto enable verbose logging all the time but you're going to be\nbut you're going to be\nbut you're going to be uh just just going mad with a lot of\nuh just just going mad with a lot of\nuh just just going mad with a lot of logs if you enable this for the most\nlogs if you enable this for the most\nlogs if you enable this for the most part you don't really need that\npart you don't really need that\npart you don't really need that right if you think that some sort of\nright if you think that some sort of\nright if you think that some sort of logs are getting hidden or you want to\nlogs are getting hidden or you want to\nlogs are getting hidden or you want to dig deeper into library code or whatever\ndig deeper into library code or whatever\ndig deeper into library code or whatever then you can go ahead and enable verse\nthen you can go ahead and enable verse\nthen you can go ahead and enable verse logging but that is that is\nlogging but that is that is\nlogging but that is that is like all uh you would need as\nlike all uh you would need as\nlike all uh you would need as a default level right so\na default level right so\na default level right so now coming to the filter part you're\nnow coming to the filter part you're\nnow coming to the filter part you're gonna see that you can actually let me\ngonna see that you can actually let me\ngonna see that you can actually let me just go ahead and generate some locks\njust go ahead and generate some locks\njust go ahead and generate some locks real quick\nreal quick\nreal quick you can actually search using text right\nyou can actually search using text right\nyou can actually search using text right so it's very straightforward if i just\nso it's very straightforward if i just\nso it's very straightforward if i just write let's see\nwrite let's see\nwrite let's see hello there so we only get the logs\nhello there so we only get the logs\nhello there so we only get the logs which say hello there so far right and\nwhich say hello there so far right and\nwhich say hello there so far right and this group is empty because\nthis group is empty because\nthis group is empty because well the group does not contain any\nwell the group does not contain any\nwell the group does not contain any hello there you can\nhello there you can\nhello there you can also search um on the basis of regular\nalso search um on the basis of regular\nalso search um on the basis of regular expression\nexpression\nexpression right and if you don't know about\nright and if you don't know about\nright and if you don't know about regular expressions it's it's fine\nregular expressions it's it's fine\nregular expressions it's it's fine if you know about regular expressions\nif you know about regular expressions\nif you know about regular expressions it's also fine\nit's also fine\nit's also fine i mean for people who do not know what\ni mean for people who do not know what\ni mean for people who do not know what regular expressions are\nregular expressions are\nregular expressions are it is sort of a\nmore efficient and mathematical way of\nmore efficient and mathematical way of matching expressions in a text right\nmatching expressions in a text right\nmatching expressions in a text right so it has a lot of use cases i mean\nso it has a lot of use cases i mean\nso it has a lot of use cases i mean email validation or you know\nemail validation or you know\nemail validation or you know restricting the length of input or the\nrestricting the length of input or the\nrestricting the length of input or the characters allowed and all that stuff\ncharacters allowed and all that stuff\ncharacters allowed and all that stuff but here you can also perform a regular\nbut here you can also perform a regular\nbut here you can also perform a regular expression based search so if you\nexpression based search so if you\nexpression based search so if you started with a\nstarted with a\nstarted with a slash and it ended to the slash chrome\nslash and it ended to the slash chrome\nslash and it ended to the slash chrome is smart enough to know that you're\nis smart enough to know that you're\nis smart enough to know that you're writing a regular expression now\nwriting a

you can now see that we only get uh sort of the things which start with an\nsort of the things which start with an\nsort of the things which start with an edge right\nedge right\nedge right similarly i can write an exclamation\nsimilarly i can write an exclamation\nsimilarly i can write an exclamation mark here\nmark here\nmark here and i could probably say it ends with\nand i could probably say

this file system thing is\nexactly what this file system thing is\nexactly what this file system thing is but we're going to not be discussing\nbut we're going to not be discussing\nbut we're going to not be discussing this\nthis\nthis but anyway i'm just going to go back to\nbut anyway i'm just going to go back to\nbut anyway i'm just going to go back to our basic example because it shows much\nour basic example because it shows much\nour basic example because it shows much less stuff\nless stuff\nless stuff so you can see on the basic example we\nso you can see on the basic example we\nso you can see on the basic example we have a top panel\nhave a top panel\nhave a top panel with the domain name what we have\nwith the domain name what we have\nwith the domain name what we have

and click on this play button\nahead and click on this play button\nahead and click on this play button and you can see that exact number\nand you can see that exact number\nand you can see that exact number appears on the screen even though we did\nappears on the screen even though we did\nappears on the screen even though we did not know\nnot know\nnot know the random number obviously up front so\nthe random number obviously up front so\nthe random number obviously up front so this is how\nthis is how\nthis is how you can sort of how you can set a\nyou can sort of how you can set a\nyou can sort of how you can set a debugger\ndebugger\ndebugger this is a very basic thing you know the\nthis is a very basic thing you know the\nthis is a very basic thing you know the very basic

that hey i want the random number to\nsay that hey i want the random number to\nsay that hey i want the random number to be\nbe\nbe one right and hit enter and clear the\none right and hit enter and clear the\none right and hit enter and clear the console you can clear the console by\nconsole you can clear the console by\nconsole you can clear the console by command k\ncommand k\ncommand k if

there's that\nwriting clear like this so there's that and once you're in sources now you can\nand once you're in sources now you can\nand once you're in sources now you can see the random number i have changed the\nsee the random number i have changed the\nsee the random number i have changed the random number to 1\nrandom number to 1\nrandom number to 1 by actually writing it in the

because i change it between the\nwhy because i change it between the execution\nexecution\nexecution of the function which is a super\nof the function which is a super\nof the function which is a super powerful thing if you think about it\npowerful thing if you think about it\npowerful thing if you think about it right so now you can modify code on the\nright so now you can modify code on the\nright so now you can modify code on the run not on the\nrun not on the\nrun not on the files or you know something like that\nfiles or you know something like that\nfiles or you know something like that so yeah that's that's one way to go\nso yeah that's that's one way to go\nso yeah that's that's one way to go about debugging and that's like a\nabout debugging and that's like a\nabout debugging and that's like a 101 for uh the breakpoint but we have a\n101 for uh the breakpoint but we have a\n101 for uh the breakpoint but we have a lot of\nlot of\nlot of stuff to discuss in the breakpoints so i\nstuff to discuss in the breakpoints so i\nstuff to discuss in the breakpoints so i would be getting into that\nwould be getting into that\nwould be getting into that in the next video so yeah that's pretty\nin the next video so yeah that's pretty\nin the next video so yeah that's pretty much it for this one i'm going to see\nmuch it for this one i'm going to see\nmuch it for this one i'm going to see you\nyou\nyou in the next video so what is going on\nin the next video so what is going on\nin the next video so what is going on everybody my name is maejol and welcome\neverybody my name is maejol and welcome\neverybody my name is maejol and welcome back to another video\nback to another video\nback to another video in which i want to discuss another way\nin which i want to discuss another way\nin which i want to discuss another way of setting breakpoints in your code\nof setting breakpoints in your code\nof setting breakpoints in your code now the first way which we saw is that\nnow the first way which we saw is that\nnow the first way which we saw is that open your script or you know whatever it\nopen your script or you know whatever it\nopen your script or you know whatever it is\nis\nis in the sources tab and click on the line\nin the sources tab and click on the line\nin the sources tab and click on the line number to set the breakpoint\nnumber to set the breakpoint\nnumber to set the breakpoint right so in this case if i want to set\nright so in this case if i want to set\nright so in this case if i want to set up breakpoint on line 10 there's how\nup breakpoint on line 10 there's how\nup breakpoint on line 10 there's how i will do that if i want to set a\ni will do that if i want to set a\ni will do that if i want to set a breakpoint inside the set interval it\nbreakpoint inside the set interval it\nbreakpoint inside the set interval it will immediately pause\nwill immediately pause\nwill immediately pause after a second so you can see it is\nafter a second so you can see it is\nafter a second so you can see it is paused now because this function takes\npaused now because this function takes\npaused now because this function takes every single second\nevery single second\nevery single second so you can see now the world has been\nso you can see now the world has been\nso you can see now the world has been paused nothing is executing nothing is\npaused nothing is executing nothing is\npaused nothing is executing nothing is happening\nhappening\nhappening we are all here in a in a frozen\nwe are all here in a in a frozen\nwe are all here in a in a frozen environment right and you can see that\nenvironment right and you can see that\nenvironment right and you can see that you know what all\nyou know what all\nyou know what all um there is well in this function\num there is well in this function\num there is well in this function there's nothing much interesting going\nthere's nothing much interesting going\nthere's nothing much interesting going on\non\non but you can technically see the call\nbut you can technically see the call\nbut you can technically see the call stack how this function was called\nstack how this function was called\nstack how this function was called well said in the world called it so this\nwell said in the world called it so this\nwell said in the world called it so this is not a not an interesting call stack\nis not a not an interesting call stack\nis not a not an interesting call stack actually\nactually\nactually but uh you know you get the idea so\nbut uh you know you get the idea so\nbut uh you know you get the idea so anyway\nanyway\nanyway let's just go ahead and remove this\nlet's just go ahead and remove this\nlet's just go ahead and remove this breakpoint because it'll keep on hitting\nbreakpoint because it'll keep on hitting\nbreakpoint because it'll keep on hitting so what we want to do is now you might\nso what we want to do is now you might\nso what we want to do is now you might be writing huge code bases on all that\nbe writing huge code bases on all that\nbe writing huge code bases on all that stuff and you might not just want to\nstuff and you might not just want to\nstuff and you might not just want to locate the file and\nlocate the file and\nlocate the file and the exact line number all the time so\nthe exact line number all the time so\nthe exact line number all the time so instead of doing\ninstead of doing\ninstead of doing these break points like this which might\nthese break points like this which might\nthese break points like this which might even lose if you restart your browser\neven lose if you restart your browser\neven lose if you restart your browser what you can do is set a breakpoint\nwhat you can do is set a breakpoint\nwhat you can do is set a breakpoint using a keyword known as debugger\nusing a keyword known as debugger\nusing a keyword known as debugger right so the this debugger is a\nright so the this debugger is a\nright so the this debugger is a standalone keyword you don't really have\nstandalone keyword you don't really have\nstandalone keyword you don't really have to call it as a function or anything\nto call it as a function or anything\nto call it as a function or anything and this debugger once the browser sees\nand this debugger once the browser sees\nand this debugger once the browser sees it\nit\nit it's going to pause the execution just\nit's going to pause the execution just\nit's going to pause the execution just like it pauses uh\nlike it pauses uh\nlike it pauses uh as a blue thing right so if i you know\nas a blue thing right so if i you know\nas a blue thing right so if i you know you can see that i have not really\nyou can see that i have not really\nyou can see that i have not really selected any breakpoint but if i click\nselected any breakpoint but if i click\nselected any breakpoint but if i click on this\non this\non this you can see the execution automatically\nyou can see the execution automatically\nyou can see the execution automatically stops on debugger right\nstops on debugger right\nstops on debugger right so it's a handy way to you know just\nso it's a handy way to you know just\nso it's a handy way to you know just pause the execution without locating\npause the execution without locating\npause the execution without locating your code and doing all that sort of\nyour code and doing all that sort of\nyour code and doing all that sort of random stuff and it works pretty much in\nrandom stuff and it works pretty much in\nrandom stuff and it works pretty much in a similar way\na similar way\na similar way the only downside of this is that you\nthe only downside of this is that you\nthe only downside of this is that you have to like you know you cannot really\nhave to like you know you cannot really\nhave to like you know you cannot really remove the you can technically but\nremove the you can technically but\nremove the you can technically but i'm not really gonna get into that but\ni'm not really gonna get into that but\ni'm not really gonna get into that but you can just go ahead and\nyou can just go ahead and\nyou can just go ahead and remove this blue debugger right away but\nremove this blue debugger right away but\nremove this blue debugger right away but for this you have to actually modify the\nfor this you have to actually modify the\nfor this you have to actually modify the file more on that later on\nfile more on that later on\nfile more on that later on so yeah that's pretty much it how you\nso yeah that's pretty much it how you\nso yeah that's pretty much it how you can use debugger and you have a couple\ncan use debugger and you have a couple\ncan use debugger and you have a couple of breakpoints as well so you can set up\nof breakpoints as well so you can set up\nof breakpoints as well so you can set up as many breakpoints as you want\nas many breakpoints as you want\nas many breakpoints as you want and you can mess around with the\nand you can mess around with the\nand you can mess around with the execution all day long so that's all for\nexecution all day long so that's all for\nexecution all day long so that's all for this video i'm gonna see you in the next\nthis video i'm gonna see you in the next\nthis video i'm gonna see you in the next one with some more interesting stuff\none with some more interesting stuff\none with some more interesting stuff so what is going on everybody welcome\nso what is going on everybody welcome\nso what is going on everybody welcome back and in this video\nback and in this video\nback and in this video let's just go ahead and explore a little\nlet's just go ahead and explore a little\nlet's just go ahead and explore a little bit of\nbit of\nbit of how much more of breakpoints you can set\nhow much more of breakpoints you can set\nhow much more of breakpoints you can set with the sources tab right so these are\nwith the sources tab right so these are\nwith the sources tab right so these are like\nlike\nlike i won't say these are very commonly used\ni won't say these are very commonly used\ni won't say these are very commonly used but this is available\nbut this is available\nbut this is available so the way you can set more breakpoints\nso the way you can set more breakpoints\nso the way you can set more breakpoints is\nis\nis by setting up these listeners now how\nby setting up these listeners now how\nby setting up these listeners now how they work\nthey work\nthey work is that you expand any one of them and\nis that you expand any one of them and\nis that you expand any one of them and you try to set up a listener\nyou try to set up a listener\nyou try to set up a listener now i'm not really going to get into xhr\nnow i'm not really going to get into xhr\nnow i'm not really going to get into xhr fetch that much but it works something\nfetch that much but it works something\nfetch that much but it works something like you know i can click on this\nlike you know i can click on this\nlike you know i can click on this and i can say that break when or\nand i can say that break when or\nand i can say that break when or actually let's just go ahead and do that\nactually let's just go ahead and do that\nactually let's just

and break on this\nright click on them and break on this but we'll do this on the on the elements\nbut we'll do this on the on the elements\nbut we'll do this on the on the elements tab right we won't really bother about\ntab right we won't really bother about\ntab right we won't really bother about this yet\nthis yet\nthis yet about global listeners this is also\nabout global listeners this is also\nabout global listeners this is also interesting let's just hop over to\ninteresting let's just hop over to\ninteresting let's just hop over to our main site for global listeners and\nour main site for global listeners and\nour main site for global listeners and you can see right now we do not have any\nyou can see right now we do not have any\nyou can see right now we do not have any any sort of debugger or you know\nany sort of debugger or you know\nany sort of debugger or you know any sort of breakpoint set so let's go\nany sort of breakpoint set so let's go\nany sort of breakpoint set so let's go to global listeners\nto global listeners\nto global listeners or not really global but event listeners\nor not really global but event listeners\nor not really global but event listeners and you're going to see all sorts of\nand you're going to see all sorts of\nand you're going to see all sorts of events here\nevents here\nevents here and expand the mouse one right and check\nand expand the mouse one right and check\nand expand the mouse one right and check the click listener\nthe click listener\nthe click listener so whenever you click now it will\nso whenever you click now it will\nso whenever you click now it will actually\nactually\nactually set a breakpoint right now this this\nset a breakpoint right now this this\nset a breakpoint right now this this breakpoint is because of my chrome\nbreakpoint is because of my chrome\nbreakpoint is because of my chrome extension which is\nextension which is\nextension which is bad because i did not really want my\nbad because i did not really want my\nbad because i did not really want my chrome extension script to fire all the\nchrome extension script to fire all the\nchrome extension script to fire all the time\ntime\ntime so i don't know what to do about this\nso i don't know what to do about this\nso i don't know what to do about this but anyway you can see that this\nbut anyway you can see that this\nbut anyway you can see that this this extension right here whatever it\nthis extension right here whatever it\nthis extension right here whatever it was it was trying to handle this\nwas it was trying to handle this\nwas it was trying to handle this particular click\nparticular click\nparticular click right so that is why it happened for you\nright so that is why it happened for you\nright so that is why it happened for you it might not happen because you might\nit might not happen because you might\nit might not happen because you might not have this extension installed\nnot have this extension installed\nnot have this extension installed but if i play this well you can see\nbut if i play this well you can see\nbut if i play this well you can see chrome extensions do all sorts of nasty\nchrome extensions do all sorts of nasty\nchrome extensions do all sorts of nasty stuff but you can see if i click on this\nstuff but you can see if i click on this\nstuff but you can see if i click on this button now\nbutton now\nbutton now you can see if i play it a little bit\nyou can see if i play it a little bit\nyou can see if i play it a little bit because of uh you know chrome

gave us access to you know\nit actually gave us access to you know\nit actually gave us access to you know just do something before we move on to\njust do something before we move on to\njust do something before we move on to the execution of the script\nthe execution of the script\nthe execution of the script that is the reason the reason for this\nthat is the reason the reason for this\nthat is the reason the reason for this is because we are listening\nis because we are listening\nis because we are listening for all the click events so you can set\nfor all the click events so you can set\nfor all the click events so you can set up all sorts of events\nup all sorts of events\nup all sorts of events although i won't really recommend doing\nalthough i won't really recommend

if you're trying\nif you want if you are if you're trying to reverse engineer a production website\nto reverse engineer a production website\nto reverse engineer a production website or you know some sort of web app which\nor you know some sort of web app which\nor you know some sort of web app which is sophisticated and you want to learn\nis sophisticated and you want to learn\nis sophisticated and you want to learn how it works so this is how you reverse\nhow it works so this is how you reverse\nhow it works so this is how you reverse engineer stuff\nengineer stuff\nengineer stuff so i'm just going to go ahead and remove\nso i'm just going to go ahead and remove\nso i'm just going to go ahead and remove this listener for now and click on this\nthis listener for now and click on

i'm gonna see you in the next one with some new things\none with some new things\none with some new things hey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this video let's just go ahead and take a\nvideo let's just go ahead and take a\nvideo let's just go ahead and take a look at how you can\nlook at how you can\nlook at how you can step in and out of functions in a\nstep in and out of functions in a\nstep in and out of functions in a debugger call\ndebugger call\ndebugger call so what do i mean by that so first of\nso what do i mean by that so first of\nso what do i mean by that so first of all let's just take a look at how the\nall let's just take a look at how the\nall let's just take a look at how the code is organized we have three buttons\ncode is organized we have three buttons\ncode is organized we have three buttons call starting call e and call f the\ncall starting call e and call f the\ncall starting call e and call f the first one calls log something\nfirst one calls log something\nfirst one calls log something and in the script we can see log\nand in the script we can see log\nand in the script we can see log something sets a variable\nsomething sets a variable\nsomething sets a variable calls another function sets a variable\ncalls another function sets a variable\ncalls another function sets a variable calls another function sets a variable\ncalls another function sets a variable\ncalls another function sets a variable console in the function\nconsole in the function\nconsole in the function and then we finally have a console log\nand then we finally have a console log\nand then we finally have a console log right\nright\nright the second function directly calls the e\nthe second function directly calls the e\nthe second function directly calls the e function right here uh it's a wrong call\nfunction right here uh it's a wrong call\nfunction right here uh it's a wrong call actually let's just\nactually let's just\nactually let's just change that it should be b not e\nchange that it should be b not e\nchange that it should be b not e and the third function right here calls\nand the third function right here calls\nand the third function right here calls the f function directly right\nthe f function directly right\nthe f function directly right so there's that so this is the layout of\nso there's that so this is the layout of\nso there's that so this is the layout of the thing\nthe thing\nthe thing now let's just go ahead and refresh this\nnow let's just go ahead and refresh this\nnow let's just go ahead and refresh this and let me just go ahead\nand let me just go ahead\nand let me just go ahead and go to my script and right here\nand go to my script and right here\nand go to my script and right here what i'm going to do is i'm going to set\nwhat i'm going to do is i'm going to set\nwhat i'm going to do is i'm going to set up a debugger on this lock something\nup a debugger on this lock something\nup a debugger on this lock something right and now i'm going to click on\nright and now i'm going to click on\nright and now i'm going to click on scroll starting\nscroll starting\nscroll starting now what you can do is that you know\nnow what you can do is that you know\nnow what you can do is that you know instead of just\ninstead of just\ninstead of just analyzing the state at the single point\nanalyzing the state at the single point\nanalyzing the state at the single point of debugging\nof debugging\nof debugging you can actually move forward in time\nyou can actually move forward in time\nyou can actually move forward in time step by step\nstep by step\nstep by step right so how you do that is pay close\nright so how you do that is pay close\nright so how you do that is pay close attention to this\nattention to this\nattention to this is the way you do that is you follow you\nis the way you do that is you follow you\nis the way you do that is you follow you click on this button right here called\nclick on this button right here called\nclick on this button right here called step over to next function call\nstep over to next function call\nstep over to next function call so you see the green line which is\nso you see the green line which is\nso you see the green line which is highlighted\nhighlighted\nhighlighted is always the line where your javascript\nis always the line where your javascript\nis always the line where your javascript is executing right now\nis executing right now\nis executing right now right so if you click on this you move\nright so if you click on this you move\nright so if you click on this you move to the next line now remember javascript\nto the next line now remember javascript\nto the next line now remember javascript is always going to move to the next line\nis always going to move to the next line\nis always going to move to the next line and next line and next line\nand next line and next line\nand next line and next line so if i go ahead and click this one\nso if i go ahead and click this one\nso if i go ahead and click this one right here it comes out\nright here it comes out\nright here it comes out of this function execution so internally\nof this function execution so internally\nof this function execution so internally it actually called b\nit actually called b\nit actually called b which is actually called d which\nwhich is actually called d which\nwhich is actually called d which actually called f\nactually called f\nactually called f which actually console log something so\nwhich actually console log something so\nwhich actually console log something so there's a lot of stuff going on but we\nthere's a lot of stuff going on but we\nthere's a lot of stuff going on but we missed all of that right because we\nmissed all of that right because we\nmissed all of that right because we clicked on this button so let's just go\nclicked on this button so let's just go\nclicked on this button so let's just go ahead and take a look at how we can get\nahead and take a look at how we can get\nahead and take a look at how we can get even finer control with this\neven finer control with this\neven finer control with this so i'm going to go ahead and click on\nso i'm going to go ahead and click on\nso i'm going to go ahead and click on this call starting again\nthis call starting again\nthis call starting again but this time when i click on this you\nbut this time when i click on this you\nbut this time when i click on this you see it is about to execute right\nsee it is about to execute right\nsee it is about to execute right the b function is about to execute it is\nthe b function is about to execute it is\nthe b function is about to execute it is not executed because\nnot executed because\nnot executed because well well we ran it once that is why it\nwell well we ran it once that is why it\nwell well we ran it once that is why it appears twice\nappears twice\nappears twice but it has not executed right so let me\nbut it has not executed right so let me\nbut it has not executed right so let me just go ahead and play this one\njust go ahead and play this one\njust go ahead and play this one you can see now it gets executed so\nyou can see now it gets executed so\nyou can see now it gets executed so let's clear out the console and call it\nlet's clear out the console and call it\nlet's clear out the console and call it again\nagain\nagain so now if i go to the next line you can\nso now if i go to the next line you can\nso now if i go to the next line you can see the console is empty\nsee the console is empty\nsee the console is empty now if i want to get into this function\nnow if i want to get into this function\nnow if i want to get into this function right here\nright here\nright here in order to you know jump into this\nin order to you know jump into this\nin order to you know jump into this instead of using step\ninstead of using step\ninstead of using step over i'm gonna use step into the\nover i'm gonna use step into the\nover i'm gonna use step into the function call\nfunction call\nfunction call so when i click on this you can see that\nso when i click on this you can see that\nso when i click on this you can see that it says that hey\nit says that hey\nit says that hey okay this time you do not really want to\nokay this time you do not really want to\nokay this time you do not really want to skip over to the next line\nskip over to the next line\nskip over to the next line in fact you want to dig deep into stuff\nin fact you want to dig deep into stuff\nin fact you want to dig deep into stuff right\nright\nright so when i click on this it steps into\nso when i click on this it steps into\nso when i click on this it steps into the function\nthe function\nthe function and well in an assignment there's\nand well in an assignment there's\nand well in an assignment there's nothing you really you can do\nnothing you really you can do\nnothing you really you can do so this button right here will not\nso this button right here will not\nso this button right here will not really work as a step into but\nreally work as a step into but\nreally work as a step into but more like a step you know step next\nmore like a step you know step next\nmore like a step you know step next then again if i want to get inside d i'm\nthen again if i want to get inside d i'm\nthen again if i want to get inside d i'm going to click on step into the next\ngoing to click on step into the next\ngoing to click on step into the next function\nfunction\nfunction i get into d which sets e but this\ni get into d which sets e but this\ni get into d which sets e but this function and this line this button are\nfunction and this line this button are\nfunction and this line this button are same so i can flick either one of those\nsame so i can flick either one of those\nsame so i can flick either one of those then i can step into this and you know\nthen i can step into this and you know\nthen i can step into this and you know just like this it ends right so there's\njust like this it ends right so there's\njust like this it ends right so there's nothing you can technically go into\nnothing you can technically go into\nnothing you can technically go into console\nconsole\nconsole but you won't really have a lot of uh\nbut you won't really have a lot of uh\nbut you won't really have a lot of uh sort of you know output because it's\nsort of you know output because it's\nsort of you know output because it's it's an inbuilt utility\nit's an inbuilt utility\nit's an inbuilt utility so once you have reached the end of the\nso once you have reached the end of the\nso once you have reached the end of the function if you try to step into this\nfunction if you try to step into this\nfunction if you try to step into this it will just you know go back to the\nit will just you know go back to the\nit will just you know go back to the last function because\nlast function because\nlast function because just like i said if you cannot really\njust like i said if you cannot really\njust like i said if you cannot really step into a particular function or an\nstep into a particular function or an\nstep into a particular function or an expression\nexpression\nexpression it just acts like step over the next\nit just acts like step over the next\nit just acts like step over the next line right\nline right\nline right so if i go to next line you can see it\nso if i go to next line you can see it\nso if i go to next line you can see it goes back to b\ngoes back to b\ngoes back to b next line goes back to log something and\nnext line goes back to log something and\nnext line goes back to log something and our execution\nour execution\nour execution has end and you can see right here once\nhas end and you can see right here once\nhas end and you can see right here once the execution ends you also get a return\nthe execution ends you also get a return\nthe execution ends you also get a return value\nvalue\nvalue you get the variables in scope well\nyou get the variables in scope well\nyou get the variables in scope well variable which were in scope at that\nvariable which were in scope at that\nvariable which were in scope at that time you also get access to this\ntime you also get access to this\ntime you also get access to this that's a classic javascript this right\nthat's a classic javascript this right\nthat's a classic javascript this right and uh yeah you see all sorts of global\nand uh yeah you see all sorts of global\nand uh yeah you see all sorts of global stuff as well\nstuff as well\nstuff as well so you know just if you want to have any\nso you know just if you want to have any\nso you know just if you want to have any information\ninformation\ninformation so yeah that's pretty much it for how\nso yeah that's pretty much it for how\nso yeah that's pretty much it for how you can step\nyou can step\nyou can step over the next function by stepping over\nover the next function by stepping over\nover the next function by stepping over the next line step into a function and\nthe next line step into a function and\nthe next line step into a function and out of a function\nout of a function\nout of a function and yeah that's pretty much it for this\nand yeah that's pretty much it for this\nand yeah that's pretty much it for this video as well that's mostly\nvideo as well that's mostly\nvideo as well that's mostly what you're gonna be using so that is\nwhat you're gonna be using so that is\nwhat you're gonna be using so that is all for this one\nall for this one\nall for this one i'm gonna see you in the next one really\ni'm gonna see you in the next one really\ni'm gonna see you in the next one really soon\nsoon\nsoon so what is going on everybody welcome\nso what is going on everybody welcome\nso what is going on everybody welcome back and in this video\nback and in this video\nback and in this video let's just take a look at how we can\nlet's just take a look at how we can\nlet's just take a look at how we can catch errors with javascript\ncatch errors with javascript\ncatch errors with javascript right or maybe like catch errors by\nright or maybe like catch errors by\nright or maybe like catch errors by setting debuggers\nsetting debuggers\nsetting debuggers so i'm going to go ahead and write here\nso i'm going to go ahead and write here\nso i'm going to go ahead and write here inside f what i'm going to do is i'm\ninside f what i'm going to do is i'm\ninside f what i'm going to do is i'm going to say\ngoing to say\ngoing to say if math dot random is greater than 0.5\nif math dot random is greater than 0.5\nif math dot random is greater than 0.5 which gives us a 50 probability\nwhich gives us a 50 probability\nwhich gives us a 50 probability of crash the code so i'm going to go\nof crash the code so i'm going to go\nof crash the code so i'm going to go ahead and say throw\nahead and say throw\nahead and say throw new error well\nnew error well\nnew error well the luck isn't not is not with us\nthe luck isn't not is not with us\nthe luck isn't not is not with us right and now if i go ahead and refresh\nright and now if i go ahead and refresh\nright and now if i go ahead and refresh this\nthis\nthis you're gonna see that if i move to\nyou're gonna see that if i move to\nyou're gonna see that if i move to console and if i click on call starting\nconsole and if i click on call starting\nconsole and if i click on call starting sometimes we get uh the error sometimes\nsometimes we get uh the error sometimes\nsometimes we get uh the error sometimes we don't right\nwe don't right\nwe don't right and we just might get lucky if we don't\nand we just might get lucky if we don't\nand we just might get lucky if we don't well it's a 50 50 but anyway so you can\nwell it's a 50 50 but anyway so you can\nwell it's a 50 50 but anyway so you can see\nsee\nsee that sometimes even seven times in a row\nthat sometimes even seven times in a row\nthat sometimes even seven times in a row we will not get the error\nwe will not get the error\nwe will not get the error so how do you set a debugger for this\nso how do you set a debugger for this\nso how do you set a debugger for this particular thing\nparticular thing\nparticular thing now sure you can go ahead and do that by\nnow sure you can go ahead and do that by\nnow sure you can go ahead and do that by just clicking on\njust clicking on\njust clicking on this thing right here and it'll just\nthis thing right here and it'll just\nthis thing right here and it'll just pause the execution\npause the execution\npause the execution but a better way or maybe like in a huge\nbut a better way or maybe like in a huge\nbut a better way or maybe like in a huge code base where you cannot really go\ncode base where you cannot really go\ncode base where you cannot really go ahead and set debugger on every error\nahead and set debugger on every error\nahead and set debugger on every error the way to go about that is by clicking\nthe way to go about that is by clicking\nthe way to go about that is by clicking on this called\non this called\non this called pause on exceptions right and\npause on exceptions right and\npause on exceptions right and what this means is that whenever\nwhat this means is that whenever\nwhat this means is that whenever javascript is about to throw an\njavascript is about to throw an\njavascript is about to throw an exception whenever javascript sees that\nexception whenever javascript sees that\nexception whenever javascript sees that there's an exception\nthere's an exception\nthere's an exception it's going to give you first at bat\nit's going to give you first at bat\nit's going to give you first at bat right it's gonna\nright it's gonna\nright it's gonna say that hey do you want to just analyze\nsay that hey do you want to just analyze\nsay that hey do you want to just analyze the situation\nthe situation\nthe situation if you want to do that and you can do\nif you want to do that and you can do\nif you want to do that and you can do that which i'm going to go ahead and\nthat which i'm going to go ahead and\nthat which i'm going to go ahead and clear the console and i'm going to start\nclear the console and i'm going to start\nclear the console and i'm going to start clicking the button\nclicking the button\nclicking the button so you can see on the third attempt you\nso you can see on the third attempt you\nso you can see on the third attempt you see math.random becomes\nsee math.random becomes\nsee math.random becomes greater than 0.5 well this is going to\ngreater than 0.5 well this is going to\ngreater than 0.5 well this is going to be a different number i guess\nbe a different number i guess\nbe a different number i guess every time yeah because you know this\nevery time yeah because you know this\nevery time yeah because you know this execution gives us a\nexecution gives us a\nexecution gives us a different number so anyway you can see\ndifferent number so anyway you can see\ndifferent number so anyway you can see that this time we can actually\nthat this time we can actually\nthat this time we can actually go ahead and analyze the situation so if\ngo ahead and analyze the situation so if\ngo ahead and analyze the situation so if you go ahead and actually store this\nyou go ahead and actually store this\nyou go ahead and actually store this number in a\nnumber in a\nnumber in a let's say i don't know\na variable called chance and if i say\na variable called chance and if i say chance is greater than 0.5 and if i go\nchance is greater than 0.5 and if i go\nchance is greater than 0.5 and if i go ahead\nahead\nahead and refresh this and if i start clicking\nand refresh this and if i start clicking\nand refresh this and if i start clicking on this\non this\non this you can see now that i can analyze\nyou can see now that i can analyze\nyou can see now that i can analyze chance what exactly it was so it was\nchance what exactly it was so it was\nchance what exactly it was so it was 0.73 when the code crashed right\n0.73 when the code crashed right\n0.73 when the code crashed right so that's how you set up a debugger on\nso that's how you set up a debugger on\nso that's how you set up a debugger on something\nsomething\nsomething which is an exception right now\nwhich is an exception right now\nwhich is an exception right now it by default it does not really handle\nit by default it does not really handle\nit by default it does not really handle uncaught exception\nuncaught exception\nuncaught exception it does not really handle cord\nit does not really handle cord\nit does not really handle cord exceptions so let's just see\nexceptions so let's just see\nexceptions so let's just see so let's say if i have a try catch here\nso let's say if i have a try catch here\nso let's say if i have a try catch here error and i can just say console.log\nerror and i can just say console.log\nerror and i can just say console.log log prevented and oopsy\nlog prevented and oopsy\nlog prevented and oopsy right so if you have something like this\nright so if you have something like this\nright so if you have something like this it's all fine and good\nit's all fine and good\nit's all fine and good and if you go back to console and you\nand if you go back to console and you\nand if you go back to console and you just have the default settings\njust have the default settings\njust have the default settings go back to console if i start clicking\ngo back to console if i start clicking\ngo back to console if i start clicking on this you're going to see we get and\non this you're going to see we get and\non this you're going to see we get and prevented an oopsy\nprevented an oopsy\nprevented an oopsy often but we do not see any debuggers\noften but we do not see any debuggers\noften but we do not see any debuggers kicking in\nkicking in\nkicking in right and that is because by default it\nright and that is because by default it\nright and that is because by default it does not\ndoes not\ndoes not uh pause on cod exceptions but you can\nuh pause on cod exceptions but you can\nuh pause on cod exceptions but you can change that behavior by clicking on this\nchange that behavior by clicking on this\nchange that behavior by clicking on this but this is a sort of a tricky thing\nbut this is a sort of a tricky thing\nbut this is a sort of a tricky thing because now a lot of javascript from\nbecause now a lot of javascript from\nbecause now a lot of javascript from chrome extensions and everything\nchrome extensions and everything\nchrome extensions and everything are going to come into play as well so\nare going to come into play as well so\nare going to come into play as well so if i click on this\nif i click on this\nif i click on this you can see now that even though i was\nyou can see now that even though i was\nyou can see now that even though i was in try catch\nin try catch\nin try catch it still uh you know threw in a debugger\nit still uh you know threw in a debugger\nit still uh you know threw in a debugger for me just to analyze the situation\nfor me just to analyze the situation\nfor me just to analyze the situation well we have the exception with us we\nwell we have the exception with us we\nwell we have the exception with us we have the chance variable that is the\nhave the chance variable that is the\nhave the chance variable that is the local variable\nlocal variable\nlocal variable we will have all sorts of different\nwe will have all sorts of different\nwe will have all sorts of different variables as well if we were using this\nvariables as well if we were using this\nvariables as well if we were using this in a decently uh nice manner but\nin a decently uh nice manner but\nin a decently uh nice manner but this is how you're gonna make use of it\nthis is how you're gonna make use of it\nthis is how you're gonna make use of it right but for the most part trust me you\nright but for the most part trust me you\nright but for the most part trust me you would not need this\nwould not need this\nwould not need this you would not need this right you might\nyou would not need this right you might\nyou would not need this right you might be just\nbe just\nbe just well enough for for to go for with the\nwell enough for for to go for with the\nwell enough for for to go for with the with this thing\nwith this thing\nwith this thing itself right so that's there's that\nitself right so that's there's that\nitself right so that's there's that so anyway yeah that's pretty much it for\nso anyway yeah that's pretty much it for\nso anyway yeah that's pretty much it for this video\nthis video\nthis video and yeah i'm gonna see you in the next\nand yeah i'm gonna see you in the next\nand yeah i'm gonna see you in the next one\none\none really soon hey everyone welcome back\nreally soon hey everyone welcome back\nreally soon hey everyone welcome back and in this video i'm just gonna take a\nand in this video i'm just gonna take a\nand in this video i'm just gonna take a look\nlook\nlook at how you can deactivate breakpoints\nat how you can deactivate breakpoints\nat how you can deactivate breakpoints real quick um\nreal quick um\nreal quick um if you are if you do not want to drive\nif you are if you do not want to drive\nif you are if you do not want to drive yourself insane\nyourself insane\nyourself insane right so for example a lot of times when\nright so for example a lot of times when\nright so for example a lot of times when you're working with you know setting up\nyou're working with you know setting up\nyou're working with you know setting up debuggers here and there and you know\ndebuggers here and there and you know\ndebuggers here and there and you know you think you have done your job nicely\nyou think you have done your job nicely\nyou think you have done your job nicely so if you click on this you know you are\nso if you click on this you know you are\nso if you click on this you know you are able to just\nable to just\nable to just just navigate nicely over the whole\njust navigate nicely over the whole\njust navigate nicely over the whole text stack sort of thingy right and you\ntext stack sort of thingy right and you\ntext stack sort of thingy right and you know it it is all working fine\nknow it it is all working fine\nknow it it is all working fine but now when you want to test it you\nbut now when you want to test it you\nbut now when you want to test it you have to like click on this button\nhave to like click on this button\nhave to like click on this button repeatedly right\nrepeatedly right\nrepeatedly right which might totally destroy your\nwhich might totally destroy your\nwhich might totally destroy your experience as a developer\nexperience as a developer\nexperience as a developer so what you can do is instead of like\nso what you can do is instead of like\nso what you can do is instead of like manually removing them and then\nmanually removing them and then\nmanually removing them and then making sure you remember to put them\nmaking sure you remember to put them\nmaking sure you remember to put them back again you can click on this button\nback again you can click on this button\nback again you can click on this button which deactivates these breakpoints\nwhich deactivates these breakpoints\nwhich deactivates these breakpoints right and by deactivating them\nright and by deactivating them\nright and by deactivating them it just means that they will never be\nit just means that they will never be\nit just means that they will never be called or never be triggered\ncalled or never be triggered\ncalled or never be triggered when they are deactivated right so it\nwhen they are deactivated right so it\nwhen they are deactivated right so it just works fine\njust works fine\njust works fine uh like it would without the break\nuh like it would without the break\nuh like it would without the break points but you do not really lose that\npoints but you do not really lose that\npoints but you do not really lose that information where you have put the\ninformation where you have put the\ninformation where you have put the breakpoints so you can just activate\nbreakpoints so you can just activate\nbreakpoints so you can just activate them again and when you start calling\nthem again and when you start calling\nthem again and when you start calling them you are back\nthem you are back\nthem you are back to basics right so this is like a very\nto basics right so this is like a very\nto basics right so this is like a very quick\nquick\nquick uh short video on uh this this\nuh short video on uh this this\nuh short video on uh this this deactivate breakpoints button i use it\ndeactivate breakpoints button i use it\ndeactivate breakpoints button i use it all the time when you're debugging\nall the time when you're debugging\nall the time when you're debugging you're going to use it all the time as\nyou're going to use it all the time as\nyou're going to use it all the time as well\nwell\nwell when you're trying to test changes so\nwhen you're trying to test changes so\nwhen you're trying to test changes so yeah that's pretty much it for this\nyeah that's pretty much it for this\nyeah that's pretty much it for this video\nvideo\nvideo pretty small but useful tip but yeah\npretty small but useful tip but yeah\npretty small but useful tip but yeah that's all for this one\nthat's all for this one\nthat's all for this one i'm gonna see you in the next video\ni'm gonna see you in the next video\ni'm gonna see you in the next video so what is going on everybody welcome\nso what is going on everybody welcome\nso what is going on everybody welcome back and in this video let's just take a\nback and in this video let's just take a\nback and in this video let's just take a quick look at call\nquick look at call\nquick look at call stack and what this is how it works well\nstack and what this is how it works well\nstack and what this is how it works well from a computer science perspective\nfrom a computer science perspective\nfrom a computer science perspective a call stack is a data structure which\na call stack is a data structure which\na call stack is a data structure which helps you\nhelps you\nhelps you to maintain not really you but the\nto maintain not really you but the\nto maintain not really you but the computer\ncomputer\ncomputer which helps the computer to maintain the\nwhich helps the computer to maintain the\nwhich helps the computer to maintain the execution\nexecution\nexecution of functions the order in which\nof functions the order in which\nof functions the order in which functions are executed right\nfunctions are executed right\nfunctions are executed right so let me just go ahead and deactivate\nso let me just go ahead and deactivate\nso let me just go ahead and deactivate all the breakpoints\nall the breakpoints\nall the breakpoints except the one in the f function on this\nexcept the one in the f function on this\nexcept the one in the f function on this one\none\none so let's click on this right here and\nso let's click on this right here and\nso let's click on this right here and you can see\nyou can see\nyou can see the call stack looks something like this\nthe call stack looks something like this\nthe call stack looks something like this f at the top with the arrow pointing on\nf at the top with the arrow pointing on\nf at the top with the arrow pointing on it\nit\nit then d then b then log something and\nthen d then b then log something and\nthen d then b then log something and then on click\nthen on click\nthen on click so what is happening well if you think\nso what is happening well if you think\nso what is happening well if you think about it call stack is actually\nabout it call stack is actually\nabout it call stack is actually a stack that is you know a data\na stack that is you know a data\na stack that is you know a data structure\nstructure\nstructure again which contains information about\nagain which contains information about\nagain which contains information about how exactly you have arrived on the\nhow exactly you have arrived on the\nhow exactly you have arrived on the function in which you are\nfunction in which you are\nfunction in which you are pausing the execution so f gets called\npausing the execution so f gets called\npausing the execution so f gets called somehow by\nsomehow by\nsomehow by d right because d calls it d gets called\nd right because d calls it d gets called\nd right because d calls it d gets called somehow by b\nsomehow by b\nsomehow by b because b calls it obviously b gets\nbecause b calls it obviously b gets\nbecause b calls it obviously b gets called somehow by log something\ncalled somehow by log something\ncalled somehow by log something and log something gets called by on\nand log something gets called by on\nand log something gets called by on click\nclick\nclick right and this is always gonna be a\nright and this is always gonna be a\nright and this is always gonna be a linear execution\nlinear execution\nlinear execution right it's never gonna be that on click\nright it's never gonna be that on click\nright it's never gonna be that on click calls two functions and you're gonna see\ncalls two functions and you're gonna see\ncalls two functions and you're gonna see that\nthat\nthat well it could call two functions\nwell it could call two functions\nwell it could call two functions technically you know log something can\ntechnically you know log something can\ntechnically you know log something can call two functions\ncall two functions\ncall two functions but then you're not really seeing the\nbut then you're not really seeing the\nbut then you're not really seeing the call stack of that particular function\ncall stack of that particular function\ncall stack of that particular function right because a single function at a\nright because a single function at a\nright because a single function at a single time\nsingle time\nsingle time can call only a single function because\ncan call only a single function because\ncan call only a single function because javascript is single threaded right that\njavascript is single threaded right that\njavascript is single threaded right that that is the whole\nthat is the whole\nthat is the whole point so whenever you stop the execution\npoint so whenever you stop the execution\npoint so whenever you stop the execution of the single thread\nof the single thread\nof the single thread you're gonna always get a linear call\nyou're gonna always get a linear call\nyou're gonna always get a linear call stack like this\nstack like this\nstack like this so anyway coming back to function f\nso anyway coming back to function f\nso anyway coming back to function f you can see just like you know with the\nyou can see just like you know with the\nyou can see just like you know with the line number and all that stuff\nline number and all that stuff\nline number and all that stuff so this is like all you have to like\nso this is like all you have to like\nso this is like all you have to like really worry about\nreally worry about\nreally worry about uh for a call stack but the interesting\nuh for a call stack but the interesting\nuh for a call stack but the interesting thing about a call stack is that you can\nthing about a call stack is that you can\nthing about a call stack is that you can jump over into different functions and\njump over into different functions and\njump over into different functions and you can ex\nyou can ex\nyou can ex inspect their local variables right so\ninspect their local variables right so\ninspect their local variables right so even though\neven though\neven though function f is executing right now\nfunction f is executing right now\nfunction f is executing right now javascript actually maintains the\njavascript actually maintains the\njavascript actually maintains the local variables of all the functions\nlocal variables of all the functions\nlocal variables of all the functions right i mean it has to\nright i mean it has to\nright i mean it has to right because you might use e variable\nright because you might use e variable\nright because you might use e variable after calling this function\nafter calling this function\nafter calling this function and you know a sort of a version of\nand you know a sort of a version of\nand you know a sort of a version of closer\ncloser\ncloser closure in javascript is actually based\nclosure in javascript is actually based\nclosure in javascript is actually based on a similar concept\non a similar concept\non a similar concept but it is like the this function gets\nbut it is like the this function gets\nbut it is like the this function gets executed completely but still you have\nexecuted completely but still you have\nexecuted completely but still you have to maintain the local variables but\nto maintain the local variables but\nto maintain the local variables but that's that's\nthat's that's\nthat's that's a topic for another day but yeah\na topic for another day but yeah\na topic for another day but yeah i just remembered that thing from this\ni just remembered that thing from this\ni just remembered that thing from this this sort of thing\nthis sort of thing\nthis sort of thing but anyway you can see that you can\nbut anyway you can see that you can\nbut anyway you can see that you can inspect the local variables of a\ninspect the local variables of a\ninspect the local variables of a function whenever you are jumping into\nfunction whenever you are jumping into\nfunction whenever you are jumping into it so that's pretty cool thing\nit so that's pretty cool thing\nit so that's pretty cool thing right and uh it won't really matter if\nright and uh it won't really matter if\nright and uh it won't really matter if you even name them as same const a\nyou even name them as same const a\nyou even name them as same const a and constant because local variables are\nand constant because local variables are\nand constant because local variables are you know independent from each other\nyou know independent from each other\nyou know independent from each other so there's that so yeah that's that's a\nso there's that so yeah that's that's a\nso there's that so yeah that's that's a basic introduction of what call stack is\nbasic introduction of what call stack is\nbasic introduction of what call stack is and\nand\nand you can't jump around little call stacks\nyou can't jump around little call stacks\nyou can't jump around little call stacks here and there\nhere and there\nhere and there and you can see that in inside of on\nand you can see that in inside of on\nand you can see that in inside of on click you actually get\nclick you actually get\nclick you actually get these things that event is also there as\nthese things that event is also there as\nthese things that event is also there as a variable so you can pass\na variable so you can pass\na variable so you can pass you can actually write event here and\nyou can actually write event here and\nyou can actually write event here and that will appear\nthat will appear\nthat will appear as a event of the click event right\nas a event of the click event right\nas a event of the click event right so you can do all sorts of stuff like\nso you can do all sorts of stuff like\nso you can do all sorts of stuff like that so yeah that's pretty much it for\nthat so yeah that's pretty much it for\nthat so yeah that's pretty much it for this video\nthis video\nthis video i'm gonna see you in the next in the\ni'm gonna see you in the next in the\ni'm gonna see you in the next in the next one with\nnext one with\nnext one with a lot of more information hey everyone\na lot of more information hey everyone\na lot of more information hey everyone and welcome back\nand welcome back\nand welcome back to another video in which we'll be\nto another video in which we'll be\nto another video in which we'll be taking a look at how you can\ntaking a look at how you can\ntaking a look at how you can save or edit your or update your\nsave or edit your or update your\nsave or edit your or update your javascript code\njavascript code\njavascript code directly from chrome devtools and let me\ndirectly from chrome devtools and let me\ndirectly from chrome devtools and let me just\njust\njust explain on what i mean by that so let's\nexplain on what i mean by that so let's\nexplain on what i mean by that so let's just go ahead and open\njust go ahead and open\njust go ahead and open the javascript file you can see this is\nthe javascript file you can see this is\nthe javascript file you can see this is basically\nbasically\nbasically a very simple script which adds or\na very simple script which adds or\na very simple script which adds or increments the time\nincrements the time\nincrements the time you know on the page so if i go ahead\nyou know on the page so if i go ahead\nyou know on the page so if i go ahead and open this\nand open this\nand open this in a new tab this particular url right\nin a new tab this particular url right\nin a new tab this particular url right here\nhere\nhere you're gonna see we get the same thing\nyou're gonna see we get the same thing\nyou're gonna see we get the same thing but let's just hop into\nbut let's just hop into\nbut let's just hop into dev tools right so we are still in the\ndev tools right so we are still in the\ndev tools right so we are still in the sources tab you can see\nsources tab you can see\nsources tab you can see we have been working with sources for a\nwe have been working with sources for a\nwe have been working with sources for a while in this section\nwhile in this section\nwhile in this section and if i go top the section and\nand if i go top the section and\nand if i go top the section and script.js\nscript.js\nscript.js you can see this is like the pretty much\nyou can see this is like the pretty much\nyou can see this is like the pretty much what we have right now\nwhat we have right now\nwhat we have right now now what you can do is you can actually\nnow what you can do is you can actually\nnow what you can do is you can actually make edits directly in this particular\nmake edits directly in this particular\nmake edits directly in this particular file you know\nfile you know\nfile you know you can just hop over to any place and\nyou can just hop over to any place and\nyou can just hop over to any place and just like a text editor you're going to\njust like a text editor you're going to\njust like a text editor you're going to make edits\nmake edits\nmake edits but you're going to see that it does not\nbut you're going to see that it does not\nbut you're going to see that it does not reflect so you press command\nreflect so you press command\nreflect so you press

patches the file in the memory itself\npatches the file in the memory itself\npatches the file in the memory itself right let me just tell you what do i\nright let me just tell you what do i\nright let me just tell you what do i mean by that so let's just go ahead and\nmean by that so let's just go ahead and\nmean by that so let's just go ahead and create a function here\ncreate a function here\ncreate a function here which says um i don't know\nwhich says um i don't know\nwhich says um i don't know return time duration for example\nreturn time duration for example\nreturn time duration for example right and from here i return 1000\nright and from here i return 1000\nright and from here i return 1000 instead of just hard coding it\ninstead of just hard coding it\ninstead of just hard coding it and right here or this probably might\nand right here or this probably might\nand right here or this probably might not be the right example because this is\nnot be the right example because this is\nnot be the right example because this is just called\njust called\njust called this will just be called once yeah\nthis will just be called once yeah\nthis will just be called once yeah because you know\nbecause you know\nbecause you know you cannot really update the interval\nyou cannot really update the interval\nyou cannot really update the interval when while it's\nwhen while it's\nwhen while it's running so let's do a little bit\nrunning so let's do a little bit\nrunning so let's do a little bit different thing so i'm going to call a\ndifferent thing so i'm going to call a\ndifferent thing so i'm going to call a function here let's say\nfunction here let's say\nfunction here let's say console.log something a very simple\nconsole.log something a very simple\nconsole.log something a very simple thing which console logs something every\nthing which console logs something every\nthing which console logs something every single second\nsingle second\nsingle second and this is this console.log\nand this is this console.log\nand this is this console.log something funny i don't know i'm a\nsomething funny i don't know i'm a\nsomething funny i don't know i'm a boring guy at choosing examples\nboring guy at choosing examples\nboring guy at choosing examples but anyway now if you go ahead and\nbut anyway now if you go ahead and\nbut anyway now if you go ahead and refresh this page\nrefresh this page\nrefresh this page you're going to see every single second\nyou're going to see every single second\nyou're going to see every single second you get this console log of something\nyou get this console log of something\nyou get this console log of something funny\nfunny\nfunny right now what you can do\nright now what you can do\nright now what you can do is you can hop over in this in this file\nis you can hop over in this in this file\nis you can hop over in this in this file which is selected automatically\nwhich is selected automatically\nwhich is selected automatically in the sources tab you can just go ahead\nin the sources tab you can just go ahead\nin the sources tab you can just go ahead and close the other ones it kind of is\nand close the other ones it kind of is\nand close the other ones it kind of is confusing but these are just extension\nconfusing but these are just extension\nconfusing but these are just extension files not really loaded on the page\nfiles not really loaded on the page\nfiles not really loaded on the page and you can change this behavior you can\nand you can change this behavior you can\nand you can change this behavior you can say\nsay\nsay something not funny right and once you\nsomething not funny right and once you\nsomething not funny right and once you do that\ndo that\ndo that hit command s to save it or control s on\nhit command s to save it or control s on\nhit command s to save it or control s on your systems\nyour systems\nyour systems and now when you go to the console\nand now when you go to the console\nand now when you go to the console you're gonna see something not\nyou're gonna see something not\nyou're gonna see something not funny keeps on getting locked so you\nfunny keeps on getting locked so you\nfunny keeps on getting locked so you have seen that you have in real time\nhave seen that you have in real time\nhave seen that you have in real time actually changed the javascript's\nactually changed the javascript's\nactually changed the javascript's behavior\nbehavior\nbehavior right so it is patched on the run so\nright so it is patched on the run so\nright so it is patched on the run so that is how you can make some changes if\nthat is how you can make some changes if\nthat is how you can make some changes if you want\nyou want\nyou want for example you know if you have a\nfor example you know if you have a\nfor example you know if you have a button right here\nbutton right here\nbutton right here so if you have a button i don't know\nso if you have a button i don't know\nso if you have a button i don't know let's create a button here button\nlet's create a button here button\nlet's create a button here button on click some action\non click some action\non click some action right call some action\nand right here let's say that you made a\nand right here let's say that you made a mistake when you're coding\nmistake when you're coding\nmistake when you're coding right so if you have some action let's\nright so if you have some action let's\nright so if you have some action let's say you do some processing\nsay you do some processing\nsay you do some processing and then you finally alert some action\nand then you finally alert some action\nand then you finally alert some action completed right but let's say you made\ncompleted right but let's say you made\ncompleted right but let's say you made some mistake\nsome mistake\nsome mistake and there's there's some syntax error or\nand there's there's some syntax error or\nand there's there's some syntax error or you know\nyou know\nyou know you have a variable var one is hundred\nyou have a variable var one is hundred\nyou have a variable var one is hundred and then you try to do r2\nand then you try to do r2\nand then you try to do r2 is 200 right so you have something like\nis 200 right so you have something like\nis 200 right so you have something like this\nthis\nthis and something like you know not part 2\nand something like you know not part 2\nand something like you know not part 2 var1 itself\nvar1 itself\nvar1 itself and var1 right so this is an error right\nand var1 right so this is an error right\nand var1 right so this is an error right because you're assigning reassigning to\nbecause you're assigning reassigning to\nbecause you're assigning reassigning to const value\nconst value\nconst value but let's just go ahead and refresh this\nbut let's just go ahead and refresh this\nbut let's just go ahead and refresh this page now click on this button\npage now click on this button\npage now click on this button and you're going to see in the console\nand you're going to see in the console\nand you're going to see in the console you get assignment to constant variable\nyou get assignment to constant variable\nyou get assignment to constant variable as the error\nas the error\nas the error which is exactly what you will expect\nwhich is exactly what you will expect\nwhich is exactly what you will expect and we also have another error so let's\nand we also have another error so let's\nand we also have another error so let's just remove that\njust remove that\njust remove that so that we can just keep focus on the\nso that we can just keep focus on the\nso that we can just keep focus on the single one so you can see this is an\nsingle one so you can see this is an\nsingle one so you can see this is an error\nerror\nerror so what you can do is hop over into this\nso what you can do is hop over into this\nso what you can do is hop over into this you can edit the statement\nyou can edit the statement\nyou can edit the statement within itself now you can either make\nwithin itself now you can either make\nwithin itself now you can either make this lit or make remove this line\nthis lit or make remove this line\nthis lit or make remove this line save this right here and now if you\nsave this right here and now if you\nsave this right here and now if you click on this\nclick on this\nclick on this you're gonna see that you get an alert\nyou're gonna see that you get an alert\nyou're gonna see that you get an alert nice alert some action completed\nnice alert some action completed\nnice alert some action completed with 200 right so you can see it's a\nwith 200 right so you can see it's a\nwith 200 right so you can see it's a very quick way to i trade over changes\nvery quick way to i trade over changes\nvery quick way to i trade over changes instead of like manually jumping to and\ninstead of like manually jumping to and\ninstead of like manually jumping to and fro in your file system\nfro in your file system\nfro in your file system and it helps you save a lot of time\nand it helps you save a lot of time\nand it helps you save a lot of time right it helps you save a lot of time\nright it helps you save a lot of time\nright it helps

have to review the\nprograms when i have to review the\nprograms when i have to review the diaries of people in the code\ndiaries of people in the code\ndiaries of people in the code mentorship so i have multiple diaries\nmentorship so i have multiple diaries\nmentorship so i have multiple diaries here\nhere\nhere and what i will do is i will just write\nand what i will do is i will just write\nand what i will do is i will just write a loop links dot for each\na loop links dot for each\na loop links dot for each link first of all these links are\nlink first of all these links are\nlink first of all these links are extracted from the excel sheet and then\nextracted from the excel sheet and then\nextracted from the excel sheet and then for every link i would just say

is\nthe snippet and that is\nthe snippet and that is to press command p on your\nto press command p on your\nto press command p on your system and once you do that this nice\nsystem and once you do that this nice\nsystem and once you do that this nice little dialog box opens up\nlittle dialog box opens up\nlittle dialog box opens up it could be control p on the windows\nit could be control p on

right or api calls so super excited to start with this and\nso super excited to start with this and\nso super excited to start with this and tell you a lot of things about this\ntell you a lot of things about this\ntell you a lot of things about this but yeah that's that's how we're gonna\nbut yeah that's that's how we're gonna\nbut yeah that's that's how we're gonna roll in this section\nroll in this section\nroll in this section so that is all for this video let me\nso that is all for this video let me\nso that is all for this video let me just go ahead and jump over\njust go ahead and jump over\njust go ahead and jump over to the next one really soon all right\nto the next one really soon all right\nto the next one really soon all right everyone welcome back\neveryone welcome back\neveryone welcome back and in this video let's just go ahead\nand in this video let's just go ahead\nand in this video let's just go ahead and take a look at\nand take a look at\nand take a look at an overview of network request so first\nan overview of network request so first\nan overview of network request so first things first\nthings first\nthings first whenever you open a website and you\nwhenever you open a website and you\nwhenever you open a website and you right click\nright click\nright click inspect and go to network chances\ninspect and go to network chances\ninspect and go to network chances are you're not gonna see the you know\nare you're not gonna see the you know\nare you're not gonna see the you know request at all or maybe just couple of\nrequest at all or maybe just couple of\nrequest at all or maybe just couple of requests which have just been made\nrequests which have just been made\nrequests which have just been made right and the reason for this is that\nright and the reason for this is that\nright and the reason for this is that chrome actually starts logging the\nchrome actually starts logging the\nchrome actually starts logging the network request nicely for you only when\nnetwork request nicely for you only when\nnetwork request nicely for you only when you have dev tools open\nyou have dev tools open\nyou have dev tools open right you might think why is that\nright you might think why is that\nright you might think why is that because you know this just making these\nbecause you know this just making these\nbecause you know this just making these logs appear\nlogs appear\nlogs appear and you know just doing sort of\nand you know just doing sort of\nand you know just doing sort of uh storing of these network requests to\nuh storing of these network requests to\nuh storing of these network requests to be displayed in the dev tools\nbe displayed in the dev tools\nbe displayed in the dev tools is sort of you know something which\nis sort of you know something which\nis sort of you know something which requires some cpu and memory and all\nrequires some cpu and memory and all\nrequires some cpu and memory and all that stuff\nthat stuff\nthat stuff and for the most part of people who are\nand for the most part of people who are\nand for the most part of people who are not developers\nnot developers\nnot developers i mean chrome has a very huge chunk of\ni mean chrome has a very huge chunk of\ni mean chrome has a very huge chunk of market share and not a lot of people out\nmarket share and not a lot of people out\nmarket share and not a lot of people out of them would be developers\nof them would be developers\nof them would be developers it does not really make sense to just\nit does not really make sense to just\nit does not really make sense to just hold that cpu and memory wasting over\nhold that cpu and memory wasting over\nhold that cpu and memory wasting over here\nhere\nhere right so that is why chrome just keeps\nright so that is why chrome just keeps\nright so that is why chrome just keeps or chrome just introduces\nor chrome just introduces\nor chrome just introduces the logs whenever you have them opened\nthe logs whenever you have them opened\nthe logs whenever you have them opened otherwise it will not\notherwise it will not\notherwise it will not you know lock the request in the\nyou know lock the request in the\nyou know lock the request in the background so\nbackground so\nbackground so anyway once you are in this tab you\nanyway once you are in this tab you\nanyway once you are in this tab you might not see it something like this you\nmight not see it something like this you\nmight not see it something like this you might see it\nmight see it\nmight see it something like this as far as i remember\nsomething like this as far as i remember\nsomething like this as far as i remember right so this is how the typical tab\nright so this is how the typical tab\nright so this is how the typical tab starts\nstarts\nstarts now the first thing you can do is you\nnow the first thing you can do is you\nnow the first thing you can do is you can just go ahead and disable them\ncan just go ahead and disable them\ncan just go ahead and disable them from here to be honest i don't really\nfrom here to be honest i don't really\nfrom here to be honest i don't really use this\nuse this\nuse this overview feature which shows the latency\noverview feature which shows the latency\noverview feature which shows the latency and you know\nand you know\nand you know the request time a lot because as a\nthe request time a lot because as a\nthe request time a lot because as a front-end developer if you're a\nfront-end developer if you're a\nfront-end developer if you're a front-end developer you cannot really do\nfront-end developer you cannot really do\nfront-end developer you cannot really do much to improve this this is just\nmuch to improve this this is just\nmuch to improve this this is just depends on the dns time and the\ndepends on the dns time and the\ndepends on the dns time and the dns resolution time and the request time\ndns resolution time and the request time\ndns resolution time and the request time and response time and all that stuff\nand response time and all that stuff\nand response time and all that stuff so you can go ahead and keep this\nso you can go ahead and keep this\nso you can go ahead and keep this disabled just to keep keep a clean view\ndisabled just to keep keep a clean view\ndisabled just to keep keep a clean view and once you have done that you would\nand once you have done that you would\nand once you have done that you would probably\nprobably\nprobably also i mean if you do not see this this\nalso i mean if you do not see this this\nalso i mean if you do not see this this filters\nfilters\nfilters right here then make sure you click on\nright here then make sure you click on\nright here then make sure you click on this because this this is just a nice\nthis because this this is just a nice\nthis because this this is just a nice thing to have on screen next up is this\nthing to have on screen next up is this\nthing to have on screen next up is this button right here\nbutton right here\nbutton right here so what you're gonna see is as i browse\nso what you're gonna see is as i browse\nso what you're gonna see is as i browse this website let's say codedam.com if i\nthis website let's say codedam.com if i\nthis website let's say codedam.com if i click on learningpath you can see i can\nclick on learningpath you can see i can\nclick on learningpath you can see i can see a lot of network requests being made\nsee a lot of network requests being made\nsee a lot of network requests being made right but if i click on this button\nright but if i click on this button\nright but if i click on this button right here which has now stopped\nright here which has now stopped\nright here which has now stopped logging the network request now if i go\nlogging the network request now if i go\nlogging the network request now if i go ahead and you know just go to other\nahead and you know just go to other\nahead and you know just go to other pages\npages\npages you're going to see that no network\nyou're going to see that no network\nyou're going to see that no network request gets locked now and as soon as i\nrequest gets locked now and as soon as i\nrequest gets locked now and as soon as i resume it\nresume it\nresume it you know the lock gets clear first of\nyou know the lock gets clear first of\nyou know the lock gets clear first of all and now i\nall and now i\nall and now i can scroll down because i know that this\ncan scroll down because i know that this\ncan scroll down because i know that this is lazy loading in effect\nis lazy loading in effect\nis lazy loading in effect so that is why it loads the images and\nso that is why it loads the images and\nso that is why it loads the images and you know the data\nyou know the data\nyou know the data lazily so yeah i mean that's that's the\nlazily so yeah i mean that's that's the\nlazily so yeah i mean that's that's the basic of network requests\nbasic of network requests\nbasic of network requests that you know you can toggle the\nthat you know you can toggle the\nthat you know you can toggle the behavior you can clear it with the\nbehavior you can clear it with the\nbehavior you can clear it with the button\nbutton\nbutton you have a little bit of bells and\nyou have a little bit of bells and\nyou have a little bit of bells and whistles going on here with the settings\nwhistles going on here with the settings\nwhistles going on here with the settings and you know\nand you know\nand you know filters and search we're going to come\nfilters and search we're going to come\nfilters and search we're going to come to that later on\nto that later on\nto that later on and there's also this disabled cache for\nand there's also this disabled cache for\nand there's also this disabled cache for you it might not be\nyou it might not be\nyou it might not be enabled but i try to keep it enabled so\nenabled but i try to keep it enabled so\nenabled but i try to keep it enabled so that\nthat\nthat i do not get cached responses from\ni do not get cached responses from\ni do not get

there's that that's that's like a\nso there's that that's that's like a basic introduction in the next video\nbasic introduction in the next video\nbasic introduction in the next video we're going to be diving deep into a\nwe're going to be diving deep into a\nwe're going to be diving deep into a single request\nsingle request\nsingle request seeing how it sort of works internally\nseeing how it sort of works internally\nseeing how it sort of works internally right and\nright and\nright and what all information um\nwhat all information um\nwhat all information um the dev tools provide to you as a\nthe dev tools provide to you as a\nthe dev tools provide to you as a developer\ndeveloper\ndeveloper so that is all for this one i'm gonna\nso that is all for this one i'm gonna\nso that is all for this one i'm gonna see you in the next video\nsee you in the next video\nsee you in the next video hey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this video let us just go ahead\nvideo let us just go ahead\nvideo let us just go ahead and take a deep look into a single\nand take a deep look into a single\nand take a deep look into a single request\nrequest\nrequest now let's just go ahead and do that\nnow let's just go ahead and do that\nnow let's just go ahead and do that first of all let me just go ahead and\nfirst of all let me just go ahead and\nfirst of all let me just go ahead and refresh this\nrefresh this\nrefresh this and you can see at the top the first\nand you can see at the top the first\nand you can see at the top the first thing which happens\nthing which happens\nthing which happens is pay close attention to how these\nis pay close attention to how these\nis pay close attention to how these requests are laid down\nrequests are laid down\nrequests are laid down these requests are laid down in the\nthese requests are laid down in the\nthese requests are laid down in the order they are\norder they are\norder they are made not in the order when they are\nmade not in the order when they are\nmade not in the order when they are resolved right so it is possible that\nresolved right so it is possible that\nresolved right so it is possible that this request takes\nthis request takes\nthis request takes three seconds but this one takes 20\nthree seconds but this one takes 20\nthree seconds but this one takes 20 milliseconds\nmilliseconds\nmilliseconds and you know the order would be same so\nand you know the order would be same so\nand you know the order would be same so what

that's basically it\nright and uh yep that's basically it\nright and uh yep that's basically it that's all there is to a request there\nthat's all there is to a request there\nthat's all there is to a request there might be a body\nmight be a body\nmight be a body in case of post request and you know\nin case of post request and you know\nin case of post request and you know when you're uploading something or\nwhen you're uploading something or\nwhen you're uploading something or saving a form or something\nsaving a form or something\nsaving a form or something but for the most part this is fine then\nbut for the most part this is fine then\nbut for the most part this is fine then in this tab in this particular tab right\nin this tab in this particular tab right\nin this tab in this particular tab right here in the networks tab\nhere in the networks tab\nhere in the networks tab you'll also have a preview section which\nyou'll also have a preview section which\nyou'll also have a preview section which sort of gives you the html preview\nsort of gives you the html preview\nsort of gives you the html preview of the thing which you're looking for\nof the thing which you're looking for\nof the thing which you're looking for right so if you select let's say a css\nright so if you select let's say a css\nright so if you select let's say a css request\nrequest\nrequest the preview will give you a nice little\nthe preview will give you a nice little\nthe preview will give you a nice little uh you know i have\nuh you know i have\nuh you know i have clicked on this automatically i have\nclicked on this automatically i have\nclicked on this automatically i have this configured automatically by default\nthis configured automatically by default\nthis configured automatically by default you might see something like this\nyou might see something like this\nyou might see something like this but you if you click on this button\nbut you if you click on this button\nbut you if you click on this button right here pretty print\nright here pretty print\nright here pretty print it actually nicely formats your document\nit actually nicely formats your document\nit actually nicely formats your document as well right\nas well right\nas well right and this is like especially useful for\nand this is like especially useful for\nand this is like especially useful for javascript so if i click on this i mean\njavascript so if i click on this i mean\njavascript so if i click on this i mean for me you are seeing it by default\nfor me you are seeing it by default\nfor me you are seeing it by default because i remember i have turned out\nbecause i remember i have turned out\nbecause i remember i have turned out turned on a setting\nturned on a setting\nturned on a setting um which does that but if you do not see\num which does that but if you do not see\num which does that but if you do not see that you can just go ahead and click on\nthat you can just go ahead and click on\nthat you can just go ahead and click on this button manually\nthis button manually\nthis button manually and will pretty print the file right all\nand will pretty print the file right all\nand will pretty print the file right all that does not really\nthat does not really\nthat does not really help that much because this is still\nhelp that much because this is still\nhelp that much because this is still sort of obfuscated but anyway\nsort of obfuscated but anyway\nsort of obfuscated but anyway so preview is that right response\nso preview is that right response\nso preview is that right response however\nhowever\nhowever response is the raw interpretation of\nresponse is the raw interpretation of\nresponse is the raw interpretation of what you have got from the server\nwhat you have got from the server\nwhat you have got from the server right and the best way to understand it\nright and the best way to understand it\nright and the best way to understand it is in case of a document\nis in case of a document\nis in case of a document right so the preview for the document\nright so the preview for the document\nright so the preview for the document would be visible something like you know\nwould be visible something like you know\nwould be visible something like you know it will try to make sense of the page\nit will try to make sense of the page\nit will try to make sense of the page but the response is the html response\nbut the response is the html response\nbut the response is the html response which you see\nwhich you see\nwhich you see right so there's that then you have an\nright so there's that then you have an\nright so there's that then you have an initiator tab\ninitiator tab\ninitiator tab which sort of gives you like you know\nwhich sort of gives you like you know\nwhich sort of gives you like you know the chain of request how it happens\nthe chain of request how it happens\nthe chain of request how it happens so you can see that at the root we\nso you can see that at the root we\nso you can see that at the root we request this particular page\nrequest this particular page\nrequest this particular page which first of all request this google\nwhich first of all request this google\nwhich first of all request this google font then it requests the\nfont then it requests the\nfont then it requests the the css file then this css file then\nthe css file then this css file then\nthe css file then this css file then this javascript file\nthis javascript file\nthis javascript file then this javascript file internally\nthen this javascript file internally\nthen this javascript file internally requests all these things right\nrequests all these things right\nrequests all these things right so you can see that you can really make\nso you can see that you can really make\nso you can see that you can really make sense of what request is being loaded by\nsense of what request is being loaded by\nsense of what request is being loaded by which script or which document or which\nwhich script or which document or which\nwhich script or which document or which part\npart\npart and just connect the dots connect the\nand just connect the dots connect the\nand just connect the dots connect the dots from this whole tree like\ndots from this whole tree like\ndots from this whole tree like representation from there\nrepresentation from there\nrepresentation from there so you see at the top at the very first\nso you see at the top at the very first\nso you see at the top at the very first level we make this request\nlevel we make this request\nlevel we make this request once we make this request this document\nonce we make this request this document\nonce we make this request this document gets loaded and makes this 1 2\ngets loaded and makes this 1 2\ngets loaded and makes this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 uh sort of request from the root level\nuh sort of request from the root level\nuh sort of request from the root level then for example you can jump into any\nthen for example you can jump into any\nthen for example you can jump into any single request like this one\nsingle request like this one\nsingle request like this one and you can see this javascript makes\nand you can see this javascript makes\nand you can see this javascript makes another bunch of requests right\nanother bunch of requests right\nanother bunch of requests right so you get the idea of how this\nso you get the idea of how this\nso you get the idea of how this initiator tab works\ninitiator tab works\ninitiator tab works so this timing tab is something i would\nso this timing tab is something i would\nso this timing tab is something i would like to discuss\nlike to discuss\nlike to discuss later on in the more intermediate or\nlater on in the more intermediate or\nlater on in the more intermediate or advanced sort of chrome dev tools course\nadvanced sort of chrome dev tools course\nadvanced sort of chrome dev tools course where we will discuss about color coding\nwhere we will discuss about color coding\nwhere we will discuss about color coding and you know the\nand you know the\nand you know the durations of dns request and what does\ndurations of dns request and what does\ndurations of dns request and what does time to first byte means it's more like\ntime to first byte means it's more like\ntime to first byte means it's more like an optimization it will be coming in the\nan optimization it will be coming in the\nan optimization it will be coming in the optimization side of courses right\noptimization side of courses right\noptimization side of courses right so yeah but you can think about this as\nso yeah but you can think about this as\nso yeah but you can think about this as as\nas\nas as a complete breakdown of a single\nas a complete breakdown of a single\nas a complete breakdown of a single request from starting to ending and\nrequest from starting to ending and\nrequest from starting to ending and where\nwhere\nwhere all the times were spent right so you\nall the times were spent right so you\nall the times were spent right so you can see that\ncan see that\ncan see that for 18 milliseconds this request was was\nfor 18 milliseconds this request was was\nfor 18 milliseconds this request was was queued\nqueued\nqueued i don't know maybe like you know you\ni don't know maybe like you know you\ni don't know maybe like you know you already were running at a maximum 680\nalready were running at a maximum 680\nalready were running at a maximum 680 tcp connections or maybe like\ntcp connections or maybe like\ntcp connections or maybe like you know the computer was not able to\nyou know the computer was not able to\nyou know the computer was not able to handle it for 18 milliseconds or\nhandle it for 18 milliseconds or\nhandle it for 18 milliseconds or you know whatever the reason is then you\nyou know whatever the reason is then you\nyou know whatever the reason is then you know you get\nknow you get\nknow you get you get the basic breakdown of the whole\nyou get the basic breakdown of the whole\nyou get the basic breakdown of the whole thing right\nthing right\nthing right um this green thing which you see is\num this green thing which you see is\num this green thing which you see is basically the browser waiting for the\nbasically the browser waiting for the\nbasically the browser waiting for the server to respond\nserver to respond\nserver to respond right so for 100 milliseconds the\nright so for 100 milliseconds the\nright so for 100 milliseconds the browser is waiting for the server to say\nbrowser is waiting for the server to say\nbrowser is waiting for the server to say something\nsomething\nsomething and then so once it starts saying it\nand then so once it starts saying it\nand then so once it starts saying it just takes three milliseconds to\njust takes three milliseconds to\njust takes three milliseconds to download it\ndownload it\ndownload it so that's pretty cool right and then\nso that's pretty cool right and then\nso that's pretty cool right and then finally the cookies tab\nfinally the cookies tab\nfinally the cookies tab is responsible for uh displaying the\nis responsible for uh displaying the\nis responsible for uh displaying the cookies which are set\ncookies which are set\ncookies which are set on this particular page right so again\non this particular page right so again\non this particular page right so again you can use this or you can use an\nyou can use this or you can use an\nyou can use this or you can use an extension like edit this cookie which i\nextension like edit this cookie which i\nextension like edit this cookie which i sort of like prefer over this one\nsort of like prefer over this one\nsort of like prefer over this one because it's much more easy to\nbecause it's much more easy to\nbecause it's much more easy to manipulate and\nmanipulate and\nmanipulate and you know just export import things than\nyou know just export import things than\nyou know just export import things than compared to this one\ncompared to this one\ncompared to this one but anyway you can use this one as well\nbut anyway you can use this one as well\nbut anyway you can use this one as well if you want\nif you want\nif you want so yeah that's that's a basic overview\nso yeah that's that's a basic overview\nso yeah that's that's a basic overview of the tabs in the network tabs itself\nof the tabs in the network tabs itself\nof the tabs in the network tabs itself and that's pretty much it for this video\nand that's pretty much it for this video\nand that's pretty much it for this video i'm gonna see you in the next one where\ni'm gonna see you in the next one where\ni'm gonna see you in the next one where we will discuss\nwe will discuss\nwe will discuss more about the networks tab hey everyone\nmore about the networks tab hey everyone\nmore about the networks tab hey everyone welcome back\nwelcome back\nwelcome back and in this video let's just go ahead\nand in this video let's just go ahead\nand in this video let's just go ahead and take a look at how you can\nand take a look at how you can\nand take a look at how you can filter the network request right so\nfilter the network request right so\nfilter the network request right so you're gonna be using this\nyou're gonna be using this\nyou're gonna be using this all the time these filters right here\nall the time these filters right here\nall the time these filters right here why because\nwhy because\nwhy because when you're visiting a single website\nwhen you're visiting a single website\nwhen you're visiting a single website chances are\nchances are\nchances are that that particular website is gonna\nthat that particular website is gonna\nthat that particular website is gonna just start\njust start\njust start you know just just cramming request at\nyou know just just cramming request at\nyou know just just cramming request at you because you know a lot of website\nyou because you know a lot of website\nyou because you know a lot of website makes a lot of requests all the time\nmakes a lot of requests all the time\nmakes a lot of requests all the time so what you want to do is for example if\nso what you want to do is for example if\nso what you want to do is for example if you're trying to see if a js request is\nyou're trying to see if a js request is\nyou're trying to see if a js request is made\nmade\nmade or you know most common one is this xhr\nor you know most common one is this xhr\nor you know most common one is this xhr if a\nif a\nif a xhr request in the background is made\nxhr request in the background is made\nxhr request in the background is made then you just filter out\nthen you just filter out\nthen you just filter out them like this right so you see these\nthem like this right so you see these\nthem like this right so you see these requests right here\nrequests right here\nrequests right here are either fetch request or our exit\nare either fetch request or our exit\nare either fetch request or our exit chart request and\nchart request and\nchart request and i'm just assuming these are all fetch\ni'm just assuming these are all fetch\ni'm just assuming these are all fetch requests because you know the type\nrequests because you know the type\nrequests because you know the type says actually the type actually says\nsays actually the type actually says\nsays actually the type actually says here that they are fetch request\nhere that they are fetch request\nhere that they are fetch request so you don't really have to like don't\nso you don't really have to like don't\nso you don't really have to like don't really have to worry about xhr anymore i\nreally have to worry about xhr anymore i\nreally have to worry about xhr anymore i guess\nguess\nguess so these are again these are like\nso these are again these are like\nso these are again these are like standard typical requests which we saw\nstandard typical requests which we saw\nstandard typical requests which we saw last time as well in the in the regular\nlast time as well in the in the regular\nlast time as well in the in the regular thing but it is sort of like easier for\nthing but it is sort of like easier for\nthing but it is sort of like easier for you to group them\nyou to group them\nyou to group them in a in a small fashion using these\nin a in a small fashion using these\nin a in a small fashion using these filters\nfilters\nfilters right you can play around with js so now\nright you can play around with js so now\nright you can play around with js so now you're going to see these are all\nyou're going to see these are all\nyou're going to see these are all javascript files nothing is like css or\njavascript files nothing is like css or\njavascript files nothing is like css or anything\nanything\nanything you have the css filter you have the\nyou have the css filter you have the\nyou have the css filter you have the images filter so you can see the preview\nimages filter so you can see the preview\nimages filter so you can see the preview for image and response\nfor image and response\nfor image and response sort of you know you don't really get a\nsort of you know you don't really get a\nsort of you know you don't really get a response because\nresponse because\nresponse because well it could technically show you the\nwell it could technically show you the\nwell it could technically show you the hex dump of image but\nhex dump of image but\nhex dump of image but i think that's that's that's fine but\ni think that's that's that's fine but\ni think that's that's that's fine but the preview shows you the image then you\nthe preview shows you the image then you\nthe preview shows you the image then you also have all sorts of\nalso have all sorts of\nalso have all sorts of similar things then you know\nsimilar things then you know\nsimilar things then you know for media media would be like audio or\nfor media media would be like audio or\nfor media media would be like audio or video if it is loaded\nvideo if it is loaded\nvideo if it is loaded like if you go to a sort of a simple\nlike if you go to a sort of a simple\nlike if you go to a sort of a simple course i guess\ncourse i guess\ncourse i guess if i just start this or enroll this\nif i just start this or enroll this\nif i just start this or enroll this course whatever\ncourse whatever\ncourse whatever if i go ahead and see you can see that\nif i go ahead and see you can see that\nif i go ahead and see you can see that now you get a media\nnow you get a media\nnow you get a media so similar thing happens when you\nso similar thing happens when you\nso similar thing happens when you actually go to youtube.com\nactually go to youtube.com\nactually go to youtube.com as well you're gonna see that the media\nas well you're gonna see that the media\nas well you're gonna see that the media starts populating\nstarts populating\nstarts populating so there's that um then the font is\nso there's that um then the font is\nso there's that um then the font is obviously the font files which gets\nobviously the font files which gets\nobviously the font files which gets loaded in this case from google's\nloaded in this case from google's\nloaded in this case from google's g static cdn the talk is basically\ng static cdn the talk is basically\ng static cdn the talk is basically the dock which appears on the the for\nthe dock which appears on the the for\nthe dock which appears

something\nsomething\nsomething very very interesting you know if you go\nvery very interesting you know if you go\nvery very interesting you know if you go to for example\nto for example\nto for example let's see if i resume a lab for example\nlet's see if i resume a lab for example\nlet's see if i resume a lab for example this one\nthis one\nthis one so we use that code then we use web\nso we use that code then we use web\nso we use that code then we use web sockets to communicate with these\nsockets to communicate with these\nsockets to communicate with these sort of let's start fresh\nsort of let's start fresh\nsort of let's start fresh these sort of updates so you can go\nthese sort of updates so you can go\nthese sort of updates so you can go ahead and see\nahead and see\nahead and see that thing as well so these are like\nthat thing as well so these are like\nthat thing as well so these are like websocket connections\nwebsocket connections\nwebsocket connections right then manifest is for manifest.json\nright then manifest is for manifest.json\nright then manifest is for manifest.json and\nand\nand other is for any other request which it\nother is for any

you're going to see css and js\nsometimes you're going to see css and js\nsometimes you're going to see css and js as well\nas well\nas well so i don't really uh exactly know what\nso i don't really uh exactly know what\nso i don't really uh exactly know what is the criteria of\nis the criteria of\nis the criteria of getting into other but yeah for the most\ngetting into other but yeah for the

always be visible in the xhr\nwould always be visible in the xhr or in the js css image and media world\nor in the js css image and media world\nor in the js css image and media world so there's that but there's also one\nso there's that but there's also one\nso there's that but there's also one little neat trick\nlittle neat trick\nlittle neat trick is what if you want to view like xhr and\nis what if you want to view like xhr and\nis what if you want to view like xhr and media together or maybe like image and\nmedia together or maybe like image and\nmedia together or maybe like image and media together\nmedia together\nmedia together or maybe like font and media you know\nor maybe like font and media you know\nor maybe like font and media you know you can just make any combination\nyou can just make any combination\nyou can just make any combination so the way you do that is you press\nso the way you do that is you press\nso the way you do that is you press command and click on the other thing\ncommand and click on the other thing\ncommand and click on the other thing right so now i have pressed command i\nright so now i have pressed command i\nright so now i have pressed command i think for windows it will be control\nthink for windows it will be control\nthink for windows it will be control or alt at least just try any key i'm not\nor alt at least just try any key i'm not\nor alt at least just try any key i'm not very sure about windows\nvery sure about windows\nvery sure about windows but it would be either one of them so\nbut it would be either

both media\none so now i have selected both media\none so now i have selected both media and font\nand font\nand font and both of the results are being\nand both of the results are being\nand both of the results are being displayed just click on any single one\ndisplayed just click on any single one\ndisplayed just click on any single one to just remove that effect\nto just remove that effect\nto just remove that effect so if i want like uh websocket and\nso if i want like uh websocket and\nso if i want like uh websocket and doc so there you go something like this\ndoc so there you go something like this\ndoc so there you go something like this right\nright\nright so yeah that's how in a nutshell the\nso yeah that's how in a nutshell the\nso yeah that's how in a nutshell the filters work in a devtool\nfilters work in a devtool\nfilters work in a devtool in the networks tab and super\nin the networks tab and super\nin the networks tab and super interesting as well super important for\ninteresting as well super important for\ninteresting as well super important for debugging and stuff\ndebugging and stuff\ndebugging and stuff so that's pretty much it for this video\nso that's pretty much it for this video\nso that's pretty much it for this video i'm gonna see you\ni'm gonna see you\ni'm gonna see you in the next one hey everyone welcome\nin the next one hey everyone welcome\nin the next one hey everyone welcome back\nback\nback and in this video let's just quickly\nand in this video let's just quickly\nand in this video let's just quickly take a look at how you can customize\ntake a look at how you can customize\ntake a look at how you can customize these column names and what you know\nthese column names and what you know\nthese column names and what you know most of them really mean\nmost of them really mean\nmost of them really mean so for the most part what you can do is\nso for the most part what you can do is\nso for the most part what you can do is right click on them and you can select\nright click on them and you can select\nright click on them and you can select the things which you want to be\nthe things which you want to be\nthe things which you want to be available inside inside this particular\navailable inside inside this particular\navailable inside inside this particular view\nview\nview and you can see by default name is\nand you can see by default name is\nand you can see by default name is mandatory\nmandatory\nmandatory right but you can toggle other things if\nright but you can toggle other things if\nright but you can toggle other things if you want for example\nyou want for example\nyou want for example this connection id is sort of like the\nthis connection id is sort of like the\nthis connection id is sort of like the tcp connection\ntcp connection\ntcp connection of the of the particular request so if\nof the of the particular request so if\nof the of the particular request so if two ids are same\ntwo ids are same\ntwo ids are same that means they are carried on the\nthat means they are carried on the\nthat means they are carried on the single tcv connection they are carried\nsingle tcv connection they are carried\nsingle tcv connection they are carried on the single tcp connection\non the single tcp connection\non the single tcp connection right so there's that right so you can\nright so there's that right so you can\nright so there's that right so you can enable that by right clicking on this\nenable that by right clicking on this\nenable that by right clicking on this and selecting the connection id you have\nand selecting the connection id you have\nand selecting the connection id you have priority oh can speak you have priority\npriority oh can

that stuff\nyou know all that stuff\nyou know all that stuff if i enable remote address for example\nif i enable remote address for example\nif i enable remote address for example then you'll start seeing the ip address\nthen you'll start seeing the ip address\nthen you'll start seeing the ip address of the remote server\nof the remote server\nof the remote server directly inside your inspector itself so\ndirectly inside your inspector itself so\ndirectly inside your inspector itself so you don't really have to click on this\nyou don't really have to click on this\nyou don't really have to click on this and then\nand then\nand then check this out right you can have\ncheck this out right you can have\ncheck this out right you can have something like this\nsomething like this\nsomething like this so it really depends on your preference\nso it really depends on your preference\nso it really depends on your preference what sort of things you want\nwhat sort of things you want\nwhat sort of things you want uh or not right so there's that you can\nuh or not right so there's that you can\nuh or not right so there's that you can disable\ndisable\ndisable things or you can you know if you just\nthings or you can you know if you just\nthings or you can you know if you just messed around you can just reset that as\nmessed around you can just reset that as\nmessed around you can just reset that as well so if i click on reset columns\nwell so if i click on reset columns\nwell so if i click on reset columns you're gonna see well it does not really\nyou're gonna see well it does not really\nyou're gonna see well it does not really resets the\nresets the\nresets the default columns but just the width but\ndefault columns but just the width but\ndefault columns but just the

chrome devtools and the way you do\nusing chrome devtools and the way you do\nusing chrome devtools and the way you do that and why you would do that in the\nthat and why you would do that in the\nthat and why you would do that in the first place\nfirst place\nfirst place is for example let's say you want to\nis for example let's say you want to\nis for example let's say you want to test how your website\ntest how your website\ntest how your website behaves or loads when the internet\nbehaves or loads when the internet\nbehaves or loads when the internet connection is poor\nconnection

well\ninteresting other options as well\ninteresting other options as well but you what you can do is you can copy\nbut you what you can do is you can copy\nbut you what you can do is you can copy this and\nthis and\nthis and right here this is a super interesting\nright here this is a super interesting\nright here this is a super interesting section you can copy it as\nsection you can copy it as\nsection you can copy it as fetch or you know nodejs fetch or curl\nfetch or you know nodejs fetch or curl\nfetch or you know nodejs fetch or curl or all as fetch this all will basically\nor all as fetch this all will basically\nor all as fetch this all will basically just copy everything\njust copy everything\njust copy everything but what we want is just copy as fetch\nbut what we want is just copy as fetch\nbut what we want is just copy as fetch for example\nfor example\nfor example now if i go ahead and go to console and\nnow if i go ahead and go to console and\nnow if i go ahead and go to console and paste this what you can see is that\npaste this what you can see is that\npaste this what you can see is that it automatically created a syntax for a\nit automatically created a syntax for a\nit automatically created a syntax for a fetch request\nfetch request\nfetch request which includes the correct resource\nwhich includes the correct resource\nwhich includes the correct resource correct headers from which the request\ncorrect headers from which the request\ncorrect headers from which the request was made\nwas made\nwas made and you know all the good stuff as well\nand you know all the good stuff as well\nand you know all the good stuff as well these are also headers only you know\nthese are also headers only you know\nthese are also headers only you know but yeah you get the idea so this is\nbut yeah you get the idea so this is\nbut yeah you get the idea so this is super\nsuper\nsuper useful not only for when you try to want\nuseful not only for when you try to want\nuseful not only for when you try to want to replay the request you can actually i\nto replay the request you can actually i\nto replay the request you can actually i guess replay from here as well\nguess replay from here as well\nguess replay from here as well i think uh let's see\ni think uh let's see\ni think uh let's see yeah i don't know maybe not but what you\nyeah i don't know maybe not but what you\nyeah i don't know maybe not but what you can do is just copy this\ncan do is just copy this\ncan do is just copy this and paste it in the console hit enter\nand paste it in the console hit enter\nand paste it in the console hit enter and what you're gonna do\nand what you're gonna do\nand what you're gonna do what you're gonna see is that that\nwhat you're gonna see is that that\nwhat you're gonna see is that that request is again made and it's visible\nrequest is again made and it's visible\nrequest is again made and it's visible in the networks tab\nin the networks tab\nin the networks tab so this is like a thing which you can\nso this is like a thing which you can\nso this is like a thing which you can use a lot of times while debugging and\nuse a lot of times while debugging and\nuse a lot of times while debugging and replaying the request\nreplaying the request\nreplaying the request and if you have a different client for\nand if you have a different client for\nand if you have a different client for example if you want to perform the same\nexample if you want to perform the same\nexample if you want to perform the same request which has been done\nrequest which has been done\nrequest which has been done on let's say a bash terminal so you can\non let's say a bash terminal so you can\non let's say a bash terminal so you can go copy and copy this as curl\ngo copy and copy this as curl\ngo copy and copy this as curl right and you can just hop over to a\nright and you can just hop over to a\nright and you can just hop over to a terminal and paste it\nterminal and paste it\nterminal and paste it now the advantage of this is that you\nnow the advantage of this is that you\nnow the advantage of this is that you can you don't have to like you know\ncan you don't have to like you know\ncan you don't have to like you know rewrite this request from\nrewrite this request from\nrewrite this request from fetch syntax to curl the browser will do\nfetch syntax to curl the browser will do\nfetch syntax to curl the browser will do it for you with the correct headers\nit for you with the correct headers\nit for you with the correct headers you know a lot of times with the correct\nyou know a lot of times with the correct\nyou know a lot of times with the correct cookies and you know that that is like\ncookies and you know that that is like\ncookies and you know that that is like the most important thing\nthe most important thing\nthe most important thing to get the request syntax correct and if\nto get the request syntax correct and if\nto get the request syntax correct and if you know that the request works in the\nyou know that the request works in the\nyou know that the request works in the browser\nbrowser\nbrowser and if you want to debug it on a\nand if you want to debug it on a\nand if you want to debug it on a production server or somewhere else\nproduction server or somewhere else\nproduction server or somewhere else you can just go ahead right click on the\nyou can just go ahead right click on the\nyou can just go ahead right click on the request copy copy a school\nrequest copy copy a school\nrequest copy copy a school and paste it in your bash terminal and\nand paste it in your bash terminal and\nand paste it in your bash terminal and will just work just\nwill just work just\nwill just work just basically beautifully right just out of\nbasically beautifully right just out of\nbasically beautifully right just out of the box\nthe box\nthe box so yeah that's that's pretty much it for\nso yeah that's that's pretty much it for\nso yeah that's that's pretty much it for this quick little video\nthis quick little video\nthis quick little video i

it has done all the good stuff so\nand it has done all the good stuff so for\nfor\nfor this let me just go ahead and go back to\nthis let me just go ahead and go back to\nthis let me just go ahead and go back to code dam real quick because i will be\ncode dam real quick because i will be\ncode dam real quick because i will be able to construct an example\nable to construct an example\nable to construct an example code damn dashboard playgrounds and html\ncode damn dashboard playgrounds and html\ncode damn dashboard playgrounds and html css\ncss\ncss i probably need to like reduce it from\ni probably need to like reduce it from\ni probably need to like reduce it from four clicks to a little bit less\nfour clicks to a little bit less\nfour clicks to a little bit less but anyway once we are on the playground\nbut anyway once we are on the playground\nbut anyway once we are on the playground inside index.html file\ninside index.html file\ninside index.html file you can see let's just remove this and\nyou can see let's just remove this and\nyou can see let's just remove this and let's just add a hello world with an h1\nlet's just add a hello world with an h1\nlet's just add a hello world with an h1 so you see that this technically works\nso you see that this technically works\nso you see that this technically works you get a hello world\nyou get a hello world\nyou get a hello world but this is a wrong html document\nbut this is a wrong html document\nbut this is a wrong html document because an html document consists of\nbecause an html document consists of\nbecause an html document consists of much more than that\nmuch more than that\nmuch more than that starting with doctype and html head body\nstarting with doctype and html head body\nstarting with doctype and html head body and all that stuff\nand all that stuff\nand all that stuff so it displays on the web page it's fine\nso it displays on the web page it's fine\nso it displays on the web page it's fine and in fact if you go to this web page\nand in fact if you go to this web page\nand in fact if you go to this web page in a new tab\nin a new tab\nin a new tab and open the source code for this you're\nand open the source code for this you're\nand open the source code for this you're going to see it since\ngoing to see it since\ngoing to see it since h1 hello world only as a web page\nh1 hello world only as a web page\nh1 hello world only as a web page but if you open the dev tools you're\nbut if you open the dev tools you're\nbut if you open the dev tools you're going to see\ngoing to see\ngoing to see that magically the html is constructed\nthat magically the html is constructed\nthat magically the html is constructed by the browser so you see this html tag\nby the browser so you see this html tag\nby the browser so you see this html tag you see\nyou see\nyou see the head tag well these are like because\nthe head tag well these are like because\nthe head tag well these are like because of some extension or something\nof some extension or something\nof some extension or something uh not coming from the browser itself\nuh not coming from the browser itself\nuh not coming from the browser itself this\nthis\nthis is the body tag this is again from\nis the body tag this is again from\nis the body tag this is again from extension i think grammarly or something\nextension i think grammarly or something\nextension i think grammarly or something these like extension try to mess around\nthese like extension try to mess around\nthese like extension try to mess around with the dom all the time\nwith the dom all the time\nwith the dom all the time but you can see this is the difference\nbut you can see this is the difference\nbut you can see this is the difference between a dom\nbetween a dom\nbetween a dom and a regular document and this elements\nand a regular document and this elements\nand a regular document and this elements tab right here\ntab right here\ntab right here always displays you the updated dom\nalways displays you the updated dom\nalways displays you the updated dom which is currently on the page\nwhich is currently on the page\nwhich is currently on the page not the html itself you know you can\nnot the html itself you know you can\nnot the html itself you know you can actually go ahead and remove this node\nactually go ahead and remove this node\nactually go ahead and remove this node as well\nas well\nas well so if you go ahead and delete this\nso if you go ahead and delete this\nso if you go ahead and delete this element you're going to see this as well\nelement you're going to see this as well\nelement you're going to see this as well this is the\nthis is the\nthis is the updated representation which is not\nupdated representation which is not\nupdated representation which is not really reflected in the source code\nreally reflected in the source code\nreally reflected in the source code right\nright\nright the source code if you go ahead will\nthe source code if you go ahead will\nthe source code if you go ahead will still display h1 hello world\nstill display h1 hello world\nstill display h1 hello world but the actual representation of the dom\nbut the actual representation of the dom\nbut the actual representation of the dom is displayed in the elements tab\nis displayed in the elements tab\nis displayed in the elements tab super important to understand and uh\nsuper important to understand and uh\nsuper important to understand and uh yeah that's that's like\nyeah that's that's like\nyeah that's that's like basically this what this section is\nbasically this what this section is\nbasically this what this section is right\nright\nright so yeah i mean that's pretty much it for\nso yeah i mean that's pretty much it for\nso yeah i mean that's pretty much it for this video\nthis video\nthis video i'm gonna see you in the next one we'll\ni'm gonna see you in the next one we'll\ni'm gonna see you in the next one we'll be diving a little bit deep into how we\nbe diving a little bit deep into how we\nbe diving a little bit deep into how we can interact with all the elements here\ncan interact with all the elements here\ncan interact with all the elements here so that is all for this one i'm gonna\nso that is all for this one i'm gonna\nso that is all for this one i'm gonna see you in the next video\nsee you in the next video\nsee you in the next video hey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this one we're gonna be taking a look\none we're gonna be taking a look\none we're gonna be taking a look at how you can inspect a particular node\nat how you can inspect a particular node\nat how you can inspect a particular node right\nright\nright so let me just go ahead and restore the\nso let me just go ahead and restore the\nso let me just go ahead and restore the nice little code which we had here\nnice little code which we had here\nnice little code which we had here and right here if i refresh this you're\nand right here if i refresh this you're\nand right here if i refresh this you're going to see that we have some nodes\ngoing to see that we have some nodes\ngoing to see that we have some nodes right and i hope you know that node is\nright and i hope you know that node is\nright and i hope you know that node is just a sort of an element\njust a sort of an element\njust a sort of an element on the dom so this p is a node this li\non the dom so this p is a node this li\non the dom so this p is a node this li is a node\nis a node\nis a node this marker sort of is also a node i\nthis marker sort of is also a node i\nthis marker sort of is also a node i think i have enabled like shadow dom or\nthink i have enabled like shadow dom or\nthink i have enabled like shadow dom or something that is why these are\nsomething that is why these are\nsomething that is why these are appearing\nappearing\nappearing i don't really know if that's an update\ni don't really know if that's an update\ni don't really know if that's an update or something but anyway\nor something but anyway\nor something but anyway you can see this is also a text node so\nyou can see this is also a text node so\nyou can see this is also a text node so how do you inspect a node\nhow do you inspect a node\nhow do you inspect a node well first of all what you can do is you\nwell first of all what you can do is you\nwell first of all what you can do is you can just right click on a node\ncan just right click on a node\ncan just right click on a node you don't even have to select it or\nyou don't even have to select it or\nyou don't even have to select it or something you know you can just right\nsomething you know you can just right\nsomething you know you can just right click on a node and click on inspect\nclick on a node and click on inspect\nclick on a node and click on inspect and by default chrome devtools is smart\nand by default chrome devtools is smart\nand by default chrome devtools is smart enough to bring\nenough to bring\nenough to bring that particular node into the focus\nthat particular node into the focus\nthat particular node into the focus right so if i right click on this\nright so if i right click on this\nright so if i right click on this and click on inspect you're gonna see\nand click on inspect you're gonna see\nand click on inspect you're gonna see that now we are inside the span tag\nthat now we are inside the span tag\nthat now we are inside the span tag right so you can see that this\nright so you can see that this\nright so you can see that this interesting flash of color right that\ninteresting flash of color right that\ninteresting flash of color right that just means that your content inside this\njust means that your content inside this\njust means that your content inside this is updated\nis updated\nis updated so that's that's something you can just\nso that's that's something you can just\nso that's that's something you can just consider right\nconsider right\nconsider right but anyway this is like one way another\nbut anyway this is like one way another\nbut anyway this is like one way another way\nway\nway is to click on this button right here\nis to click on this button right here\nis to click on this button right here which says select an element or inspect\nwhich says select an element or inspect\nwhich says select an element or inspect in the page to inspect it\nin the page to inspect it\nin the page to inspect it and you know just start hovering over\nand you know just start hovering over\nand you know just start hovering over elements right so you're gonna see that\nelements right so you're gonna see that\nelements right so you're gonna see that you get all these shiny backgrounds and\nyou get all these shiny backgrounds and\nyou get all these shiny backgrounds and boxes and all that stuff\nboxes and all that stuff\nboxes and all that stuff but what is happening actually is that\nbut what is happening actually is that\nbut what is happening actually is that devtools is trying to make sense of\ndevtools is trying to make sense of\ndevtools is trying to make sense of where your cursor is\nwhere your cursor is\nwhere your cursor is and then trying to grab an element which\nand then trying to grab an element which\nand then trying to grab an element which it thinks is the closest match of what\nit thinks is the closest match of what\nit thinks is the closest match of what you want\nyou want\nyou want so for example if i want to have this\nso for example if i want to have this\nso for example if i want to have this html and css this p\nhtml and css this p\nhtml and css this p tag and if i go ahead and click on this\ntag and if i go ahead and click on this\ntag and if i go ahead and click on this that gets into focus\nthat gets into focus\nthat gets into focus automatically then i can go ahead and go\nautomatically then i can go ahead and go\nautomatically then i can go ahead and go to h1\nto h1\nto h1 that gets into focus right i can go\nthat gets into focus right i can go\nthat gets into focus right i can go ahead and click on this\nahead and click on this\nahead and click on this just select the time that gets into\njust select the time that gets into\njust select the time that gets into focus so that's how it works\nfocus so that's how it works\nfocus so that's how it works right so this is one way this is another\nright so this is one way this is another\nright so this is one way this is another way\nway\nway another way is to within itself within\nanother way is to within itself within\nanother way is to within itself within the elements tab\nthe elements tab\nthe elements tab just press command f and it's going to\njust press command f and it's going to\njust press command f and it's going to say find by string\nsay find by string\nsay find by string selector or xpath and here just like it\nselector or xpath and here just like it\nselector or xpath and here just like it says you can say\nsays you can say\nsays you can say time right now and you know this is a\ntime right now and you know this is a\ntime right now and you know this is a string match\nstring match\nstring match selector would be a css selector for\nselector would be a css selector for\nselector would be a css selector for example if i want to search for time\nexample if i want to search for time\nexample if i want to search for time so i'm going to write id time and you\nso i'm going to write id time and you\nso i'm going to write id time and you can see it gives me that this particular\ncan see it gives me that this particular\ncan see it gives me that this particular diff right so this is basically a css\ndiff right so this is basically a css\ndiff right so this is basically a css selector\nselector\nselector and that's how it works xpath is also\nand that's how it works xpath is also\nand that's how it works xpath is also you know sort of a convention with which\nyou know sort of a convention with which\nyou know sort of a convention with which you can use to traverse the dom tree\nyou can use to traverse the dom tree\nyou can use to traverse the dom tree but to be fair i don't really know a lot\nbut to be fair i don't really know a lot\nbut to be fair i don't really know a lot of expat syntax so you can google up\nof expat syntax so you can google up\nof expat syntax so you can google up expert syntax but it'll also work\nexpert syntax but it'll also work\nexpert syntax but it'll also work it start with something like you know i\nit start with something like you know i\nit start with something like you know i don't know it starts with some slash or\ndon't know it starts with some slash or\ndon't know it starts with some slash or something i don't remember exactly but\nsomething i don't remember exactly but\nsomething i don't remember exactly but that's that's how it works for the most\nthat's that's how it works for the most\nthat's that's how it works for the most part you will be good enough with just\npart you will be good enough with just\npart you will be good enough with just string or css selector\nstring or css selector\nstring or css selector itself these are like two powerful tools\nitself these are like two powerful tools\nitself these are like two powerful tools so yeah that's that's how you're gonna\nso yeah that's that's how you're gonna\nso yeah that's that's how you're gonna select some elements three\nselect some elements three\nselect some elements three major ways first of all right click and\nmajor ways first of all right click and\nmajor ways first of all right click and inspect\ninspect\ninspect otherwise use this as the grabber\notherwise use this as the grabber\notherwise use this as the grabber otherwise for a very fine control you\notherwise for a very fine control you\notherwise for a very fine control you can use the command f\ncan use the command f\ncan use the

i'm gonna see you in the next one really\ni'm gonna see you in the next one really\ni'm gonna see you in the next one really soon\nsoon\nsoon hey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this one i just want to show you the\none i just want to show you the\none i just want to show you the operations which you can do\noperations which you can do\noperations which you can do with your dom tree layout here\nwith your dom tree layout here\nwith your dom tree layout here and trust me this is like a very\nand trust me this is like a very\nand trust me this is like a very flexible sort of environment you can\nflexible sort of environment you can\nflexible sort of environment you can play around with you can edit

can do all sorts of stuff\nsorts of stuff\nsorts of stuff so you know i can just go ahead and\nso you know i can just go ahead and\nso you know i can just go ahead and click double click on this and i can\nclick double click on this and i can\nclick double click on this and i can write\nwrite\nwrite something like this hit enter and it'll\nsomething like this hit enter and it'll\nsomething like this hit enter and it'll update on the page right\nupdate on the page right\nupdate on the page right you know all those uh people who do\nyou know all those uh people who do\nyou know all those uh people who do these inspect element hacks\nthese inspect element hacks\nthese inspect element hacks which is like super common like\nwhich is like super common like\nwhich is like super common like increasing your like count or follower\nincreasing your like count or follower\nincreasing your like count or follower account like this\naccount like this\naccount like this is done like this you know using this\nis done like this you know using this\nis done like this you know using this inspector\ninspector\ninspector so you can go ahead and make this from\nso you can go ahead and make this from\nso you can go ahead and make this from you\nyou\nyou have zero followers for example this is\nhave zero followers for example this is\nhave zero followers for example this is displayed on the page\ndisplayed on the page\ndisplayed on the page you can go ahead and make this to you\nyou can go ahead and make this to you\nyou can go ahead and make this to you have 100k followers right\nhave 100k followers right\nhave 100k followers right so i can go to my twitter for example\nso i can go to my twitter for example\nso i can go to my twitter for example uh like this and i can just go ahead\nuh like this and i can just go ahead\nuh like this and i can just go ahead and change this from 2773 followers\nand change this from 2773 followers\nand change this from 2773 followers to something like i don't know 1.8\nto something like i don't know 1.8\nto something like i don't know 1.8 million\nmillion\nmillion right so you know and just take a\nright so you know and just take a\nright so you know and just take a screenshot of this and\nscreenshot of this and\nscreenshot of this and circulate so that's how these standard\ncirculate so that's how these standard\ncirculate so that's how these standard inspect element hacks are carried around\ninspect element hacks are carried around\ninspect element hacks are carried around but anyway coming back to\nbut anyway coming back to\nbut anyway coming back to the actual thing just like i said it's a\nthe actual thing just like i said it's a\nthe actual thing just like i said it's a it's a pretty flexible thing\nit's a pretty flexible thing\nit's a pretty flexible thing right so you can just double click on\nright so you can just double click on\nright so you can just double click on something to edit its value\nsomething to edit its value\nsomething to edit its value you can double click even on the tag\nyou can double click even on the tag\nyou can double click even on the tag name and i can just write it h2\nname and i can just write it h2\nname and i can just write it h2 you know h3 if i want h4 you know just\nyou know h3 if i want h4 you know just\nyou know h3 if i want h4 you know just change everything you want\nchange everything you want\nchange everything you want right and you can also press command z\nright and you can also press command z\nright and you can also press command z or control z to undo what you did so\nor control z to undo what you did so\nor control z to undo what you did so that's pretty cool\nthat's pretty cool\nthat's pretty cool right if i made a mistake i can just\nright if i made a mistake i can just\nright if i made a mistake i can just press command z\npress command z\npress command z for example if i deleted this node right\nfor example if i deleted this node right\nfor example if i deleted this node right click and delete\nclick and delete\nclick and delete if i deleted this node by mistake oops\nif i deleted this node by mistake oops\nif i deleted this node by mistake oops i can just right click uh or maybe like\ni can just right click uh or maybe like\ni can just right click uh or maybe like command said\ncommand said\ncommand said to undo it and will appear back on the\nto undo it and will appear back on the\nto undo it and will appear back on the page\npage\npage right um you can also like reorder stuff\nright um you can also like reorder stuff\nright um you can also like reorder stuff by dragging this and dropping it here so\nby dragging this and dropping it here so\nby dragging this and dropping it here so you can see that you can edit these\nyou can see that you can edit these\nyou can see that you can edit these files as the first li which we have i\nfiles as the first li which we have i\nfiles as the first li which we have i can drag it\ncan drag it\ncan drag it and just drop it somewhere here so you\nand just drop it somewhere here so you\nand just drop it somewhere here so you can see now this is number four\ncan see now this is number four\ncan see now this is number four you can drag it and drop it above each\nyou can drag it and drop it above each\nyou can drag it and drop it above each one so there you go\none so there you go\none so there you go the pop is now above which one so you\nthe pop is now above which one so you\nthe pop is now above which one so you know you can just play\nknow you can just play\nknow you can just play uh a little bit within itself you can\nuh a little bit within itself you can\nuh a little bit within itself you can basically drag drop things you can\nbasically drag drop things you can\nbasically drag drop things you can rename tags you can rename\nrename tags you can rename\nrename tags you can rename attributes you know if this was an\nattributes you know if this was an\nattributes you know if this was an attribute which we said\nattribute which we said\nattribute which we said we can do something cool and set\nwe can do something cool and set\nwe can do something cool and set its value like this so it gets updated\nits value like this so it gets updated\nits value like this so it gets updated you know all that stuff\nyou know all that stuff\nyou know all that stuff can be done and then you can just\ncan be done and then you can just\ncan be done and then you can just probably go to\nprobably go to\nprobably go to console and say document.queryselector\nconsole and say document.queryselector\nconsole and say document.queryselector uh something cool\nuh something cool\nuh something cool by the tag name and you're gonna see\nby the tag name and you're gonna see\nby the tag name and you're gonna see that body pops up because\nthat body pops up because\nthat body pops up because well the dom is updated right the dom\nwell the dom is updated right the dom\nwell the dom is updated right the dom contains and tag which is\ncontains and tag which is\ncontains and tag which is something cool so that's why so yeah\nsomething cool so that's why so yeah\nsomething cool so that's why so yeah that's how you can work around with\nthat's how you can work around with\nthat's how you can work around with elements that's how you can play around\nelements that's how you can play around\nelements that's how you can play around with it\nwith it\nwith it and that's pretty much it for this video\nand that's pretty much it for this video\nand that's pretty much it for this video i'm gonna see you in the next one really\ni'm gonna see you in the next one really\ni'm gonna see you in the next one really soon hey everyone and welcome back to\nsoon hey everyone and welcome back to\nsoon hey everyone and welcome back to another video\nanother video\nanother video in which i will show you how you can use\nin which i will show you how you can use\nin which i will show you how you can use this\nthis\nthis dollar zero syntax to your advantage\ndollar zero syntax to your advantage\ndollar zero syntax to your advantage so whenever you click on any of the\nso whenever you click on any of the\nso whenever you click on any of the elements you can see\nelements you can see\nelements you can see this dollar zero appears and this means\nthis dollar zero appears and this means\nthis dollar zero appears and this means that whatever is the selected element in\nthat whatever is the selected element in\nthat whatever is the selected element in the dom\nthe dom\nthe dom you can use it in the console as dollar\nyou can use it in the console as dollar\nyou can use it in the console as dollar zero\nzero\nzero so once you write dollar zero you're\nso once you write dollar zero you're\nso once you write dollar zero you're gonna see this in this right now is\ngonna see this in this right now is\ngonna see this in this right now is this p tag you can also hover over this\nthis p tag you can also hover over this\nthis p tag you can also hover over this and if you go back to like\nand if you go back to like\nand if you go back to like ul for example and write dollar zero it\nul for example and write dollar zero it\nul for example and write dollar zero it becomes ul right\nbecomes ul right\nbecomes ul right this is only a console feature debugging\nthis is only a console feature debugging\nthis is only a console feature debugging feature you cannot use dollar zero in\nfeature you cannot use dollar zero in\nfeature you cannot use dollar zero in the\nthe\nthe you know in your code or anything\nyou know in your code or anything\nyou know in your code or anything because obviously that wouldn't make a\nbecause obviously that wouldn't make a\nbecause obviously that wouldn't make a lot of sense\nlot of sense\nlot of sense but this for example makes a lot of\nbut this for example makes a lot of\nbut this for example makes a lot of sense for example\nsense for example\nsense for example i can just say dollar zero dot inner\ni can just say dollar zero dot inner\ni can just say dollar zero dot inner text right\ntext right\ntext right and i just get the text for all the ul\nand i just get the text for all the ul\nand i just get the text for all the ul and lis so i don't really have to do a\nand lis so i don't really have to do a\nand lis so i don't really have to do a document\ndocument\ndocument dot query selector you know ul\ndot query selector you know ul\ndot query selector you know ul and then i'm just doing inner text right\nand then i'm just doing inner text right\nand then i'm just doing inner text right so\nso\nso this even becomes more prominent if you\nthis even becomes more prominent if you\nthis even becomes more prominent if you are into a into a\nare into a into a\nare into a into a deeply nested thing right where you\ndeeply nested thing right where you\ndeeply nested thing right where you would have a little bit of difficulty\nwould have a little bit of difficulty\nwould have a little bit of difficulty in getting out the selector well you\nin getting out the selector well you\nin getting out the selector well you technically can just you know just go\ntechnically can just you know just go\ntechnically can just you know just go ahead and right click and copy\nahead and right click and copy\nahead and right click and copy and copy the selector right here or copy\nand copy the selector right here or copy\nand copy the selector right here or copy the js path actually\nthe js path actually\nthe js path actually we're going to come to that later on but\nwe're going to come to that later on but\nwe're going to come to that later on but this is this is also a handy thing to\nthis is this is also a handy thing to\nthis is this is also a handy thing to have right you can just move around here\nhave right you can just move around here\nhave right you can just move around here and there\nand there\nand there welcome to code dam just go to console.0\nwelcome to code dam just go to console.0\nwelcome to code dam just go to console.0 dot inner text is equal to something\ndot inner text is equal to something\ndot inner text is equal to something cool\ncool\ncool hit enter and the page updates right so\nhit enter and the page updates right so\nhit enter and the page updates right so that's that's how you can also do it\nthat's that's how you can also do it\nthat's that's how you can also do it so yeah i mean that's that's pretty much\nso yeah i mean that's that's pretty much\nso yeah i mean that's that's pretty much it for the dollar zero sort of thing\nit for the dollar zero sort of thing\nit for the dollar zero sort of thing uh it is a lot it is a lot of times\nuh it is a lot it is a lot of times\nuh it is a lot it is a lot of times handy i would say\nhandy i would say\nhandy i would say uh but not exactly as in you know\nuh but not exactly as in you know\nuh but not exactly as in you know if you're trying to debug your\nif you're trying to debug your\nif you're trying to debug your javascript code it's only just handy if\njavascript code it's only just handy if\njavascript code it's only just handy if you're trying to debug your html or sort\nyou're trying to debug your html or sort\nyou're trying to debug your html or sort of like\nof like\nof like a simple thing so yeah that's pretty\na simple thing so yeah that's pretty\na simple thing so yeah that's pretty much it for this video\nmuch it for this video\nmuch it for this video i'm gonna see you in the next one hey\ni'm gonna see you in the next one hey\ni'm gonna see you in the next one hey everyone welcome back\neveryone welcome back\neveryone welcome back and in this video let's just go ahead\nand in this video let's just go ahead\nand in this video let's just go ahead and see how you can\nand see how you can\nand see how you can add styles directly from the dev tools\nadd styles directly from the dev tools\nadd styles directly from the dev tools right\nright\nright so you see this section right here this\nso you see this section right here this\nso you see this section right here this is actually interesting\nis actually interesting\nis actually interesting and what you can do using this section\nand what you can do using this section\nand what you can do using this section first of all you can see that the\nfirst of all you can see that the\nfirst of all you can see that the element which you have selected displays\nelement which you have selected displays\nelement which you have selected displays its\nits\nits all the styles right make sure in the\nall the styles right make sure in the\nall the styles right make sure in the styles tab so the elements which\nstyles tab so the elements which\nstyles tab so the elements which the element which you have selected\nthe element which you have selected\nthe element which you have selected displays the styles but you can also\ndisplays the styles but you can also\ndisplays the styles but you can also jump in and modify a lot of these styles\njump in and modify a lot of these styles\njump in and modify a lot of these styles right for example if i go to body\nright for example if i go to body\nright for example if i go to body you can see these are the styles but i\nyou can see these are the styles but i\nyou can see these are the styles but i can click on the value and\ncan click on the value and\ncan click on the value and start increasing it right i'm just using\nstart increasing it right i'm just using\nstart increasing it right i'm just using arrow key here up arrow key\narrow key here up arrow key\narrow key here up arrow key and it just increases and you can see\nand it just increases and you can see\nand it just increases and you can see that it sort of like reflects in\nthat it sort of like reflects in\nthat it sort of like reflects in in real time whenever i update the value\nin real time whenever i update the value\nin real time whenever i update the value right\nright\nright so that's that's a very nice uh sort of\nso that's that's a very nice uh sort of\nso that's that's a very nice uh sort of way of creating pages right\nway of creating pages right\nway of creating pages right you can just go ahead put it like this\nyou can just go ahead put it like this\nyou can just go ahead put it like this start increasing the values you know\nstart increasing the values you know\nstart increasing the values you know messing around with margins like 20\nmessing around with margins like 20\nmessing around with margins like 20 pixels\npixels\npixels background of black you know color of\nbackground of black you know color of\nbackground of black you know color of white so you can do all the stuff and uh\nwhite so you can do all the stuff and uh\nwhite so you can do all the stuff and uh once you're done you could probably just\nonce you're done you could probably just\nonce you're done you could probably just copy paste this in your\ncopy paste this in your\ncopy paste this in your in your file i mean that's like the easy\nin your file i mean that's like the easy\nin your file i mean that's like the easy way you can also set up workspaces we're\nway you can also set up workspaces we're\nway you can also set up workspaces we're gonna come to that\ngonna come to that\ngonna come to that later on in some intermediate or\nlater on in some intermediate or\nlater on in some intermediate or advanced course but\nadvanced course but\nadvanced course but for now you can just copy this go back\nfor now you can just copy this go back\nfor now you can just copy this go back to your playground\nto your playground\nto your playground styles file just paste it like this\nstyles file just paste it like this\nstyles file just paste it like this right and you just have the same effect\nright and you just have the same effect\nright and you just have the same effect that's simple and that's convenient but\nthat's simple and that's convenient but\nthat's simple and that's convenient but what else you can do is you can\nwhat else you can do is you can\nwhat else you can do is you can also add new styles so if you click on\nalso add new styles so if you click on\nalso add new styles so if you click on this plus button right here\nthis plus button right here\nthis plus button right here you're gonna see that it selects it's\nyou're gonna see that it selects it's\nyou're gonna see that it selects it's gets the selector which you are on\ngets the selector which you are on\ngets the selector which you are on and it gives you a new block of\nand it gives you a new block of\nand it gives you a new block of information right\ninformation right\ninformation right so you can do this to select elements\nso you can do this to select elements\nso you can do this to select elements which do not have an existing selector\nwhich do not have an existing selector\nwhich do not have an existing selector so you can go to this h1\nso you can go to this h1\nso you can go to this h1 and you can see that this is a user\nand you can see that this is a user\nand you can see that this is a user agent style sheet that's why you see\nagent style sheet that's why you see\nagent style sheet that's why you see this is bold and all that stuff so that\nthis is bold and all that stuff so that\nthis is bold and all that stuff so that is done with css internally\nis done with css internally\nis done with css internally and you cannot really edit it why\nand you cannot really edit it why\nand you cannot really edit it why because this is not present on your page\nbecause this is not present on your page\nbecause this is not present on your page it comes from the browser engine itself\nit comes from the browser engine itself\nit comes from the browser engine itself so you don't really want to edit it\nso you don't really want to edit it\nso you don't really want to edit it either\neither\neither right and this is like very easily\nright and this is like very easily\nright and this is like very easily overridable i mean this has a very low\noverridable i mean this has a very low\noverridable i mean this has a very low css specificity so whatever you do this\ncss specificity so whatever you do this\ncss specificity so whatever you do this will just get overwritten\nwill just get overwritten\nwill just get overwritten so i can just go ahead and say font size\nso i can just go ahead and say font size\nso i can just go ahead and say font size for example 40 pixels\nfor example 40 pixels\nfor example 40 pixels and start increasing it and you know it\nand start increasing it and you know it\nand start increasing it and you know it just works out of the box\njust works out of the box\njust works out of the box so there's that right you can also\nso there's that right you can also\nso there's that right you can also sort of create an interesting thing so\nsort of create an interesting thing so\nsort of create an interesting thing so you can click on this h1 you can say on\nyou can click on this h1 you can say on\nyou can click on this h1 you can say on hover\nhover\nhover i want the color to be yellow\ni want the color to be yellow\ni want the color to be yellow right and once you do that when you\nright and once you do that when you\nright and once you do that when you hover over this\nhover over this\nhover over this you know this is all fine but see that\nyou know this is all fine but see that\nyou know this is all fine but see that if i\nif i\nif i move away from this that hover sort of\nmove away from this that hover sort of\nmove away from this that hover sort of syntax is gone\nsyntax is gone\nsyntax is gone right so that hover syntax is not\nright so that hover syntax is not\nright so that hover syntax is not available now\navailable now\navailable now if i want to change the color how do i\nif i want to change the color how do i\nif i want to change the color how do i do that\ndo that\ndo that so for that thing you have to force your\nso for that thing you have to force your\nso for that thing you have to force your element\nelement\nelement into a particular state inside the dom\ninto a particular state inside the dom\ninto a particular state inside the dom itself as well right so that is that's\nitself as well right so that is that's\nitself as well right so that is that's so so that your styles appear here and\nso so that your styles appear here and\nso so that your styles appear here and the way you do that\nthe way you do that\nthe way you do that is you click on the element you go to\nis you click on the element you go to\nis you click on the element you go to this this particular thing uh\nthis this particular thing uh\nthis this particular thing uh toggle element state this hover\ntoggle element state this hover\ntoggle element state this hover by by chance it is also named hover but\nby by chance it is also named hover but\nby by chance it is also named hover but these are all the element states which\nthese are all the element states which\nthese are all the element states which you can force the element into\nyou can force the element into\nyou can force the element into right so if you click on this focus\nright so if you click on this focus\nright so if you click on this focus nothing is really happening because\nnothing is really happening because\nnothing is really happening because well we haven't defined any styles but\nwell we haven't defined any styles but\nwell we haven't defined any styles but we have defined styles for hover\nwe have defined styles for hover\nwe have defined styles for hover so when you select on hover you can see\nso when you select on hover you can see\nso when you select on hover you can see their style appears now magically\ntheir style appears now magically\ntheir style appears now magically right because in the dom although your\nright because in the dom although your\nright because in the dom although your cursor is not on the element but you\ncursor is not on the element but you\ncursor is not on the element but you have\nhave\nhave forced the element into a pseudo state\nforced the element into a pseudo state\nforced the element into a pseudo state right\nright\nright not really a pseudostate in a state\nnot really a pseudostate in a state\nnot really a pseudostate in a state which has a pseudo selector\nwhich has a pseudo selector\nwhich has a pseudo selector so now you can go ahead and mess around\nso now you can go ahead and mess around\nso now you can go ahead and mess around with you know colors and all that stuff\nwith you know colors and all that stuff\nwith you know colors and all that stuff you can actually click on the color if i\nyou can actually click on the color if i\nyou can actually click on the color if i did not tell you that\ndid not tell you that\ndid not tell you that you can click around and mess around\nyou can click around and mess around\nyou can click around and mess around with that uh with the hex values with\nwith that uh with the hex values with\nwith that uh with the hex values with the with the default\nthe with the default\nthe with the default colors you know there are some nice\ncolors you know there are some nice\ncolors you know there are some nice colors\ncolors\ncolors but yeah you can go ahead and play\nbut yeah you can go ahead and play\nbut yeah you can go ahead and play around with that all day\naround with that all day\naround with that all day but that is how you sort of like force\nbut that is how you sort of like force\nbut that is how you sort of like force the element as well into a state\nthe element as well into a state\nthe element as well into a state again you can go ahead on any single\nagain you can go ahead on any single\nagain you can go ahead on any single element\nelement\nelement click on them to get a nice selector\nclick on them to get a nice selector\nclick on them to get a nice selector start messing around with them like\nstart messing around with them like\nstart messing around with them like font size 20 pixels or you know\nfont size 20 pixels or you know\nfont size 20 pixels or you know much more than that font weight bold\nmuch more than that font weight bold\nmuch more than that font weight bold and you know if they have\nand you know if they have\nand you know if they have been hovered background green\nbeen hovered background green\nbeen hovered background green so this works but if i'm navigate around\nso this works but if i'm navigate around\nso this works but if i'm navigate around this this appears and then i can just\nthis this appears and then i can just\nthis this appears and then i can just force it into\nforce it into\nforce it into with the hover thing right and now i can\nwith the hover thing right and now i can\nwith the hover thing right and now i can again mess around with this\nagain mess around with this\nagain mess around with this and once i'm done with that you can see\nand once i'm done with that you can see\nand once i'm done with that you can see you have actually put two elements in\nyou have actually put two elements in\nyou have actually put two elements in the hover state which is pretty cool\nthe hover state which is pretty cool\nthe hover state which is pretty cool you cannot really do that with a single\nyou cannot really do that with a single\nyou cannot really do that with a single mouse uh\nmouse uh\nmouse uh but yeah that's that's how it works you\nbut yeah that's that's how it works you\nbut yeah that's that's how it works you can just toggle it back\ncan just toggle it back\ncan just toggle it back and you can toggle it back as well so\nand you can toggle it back as well so\nand you can toggle it back as well so there's that now you have a nice little\nthere's that now you have a nice little\nthere's that now you have a nice little body effect going on on the website\nbody effect going on on the website\nbody effect going on on the website right so yeah that's pretty much it how\nright so yeah that's pretty much it how\nright so yeah that's pretty much it how you're gonna work\nyou're gonna work\nyou're gonna work with this this little section styles\nwith this this little section styles\nwith this this little section styles here at least and you can edit styles\nhere at least and you can edit styles\nhere at least and you can edit styles you can move around\nyou can move around\nyou can move around and you can do all sorts of stuff so\nand you can do all sorts of stuff so\nand you can do all sorts of stuff so that is all for this one\nthat is all for this one\nthat is all for this one and i'm gonna see you in the next video\nand i'm gonna see you in the next video\nand i'm gonna see you in the next video really soon\nreally soon\nreally soon hey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this\nhey everyone welcome back and in this video let's just take a look at how you\nvideo let's just take a look at how you\nvideo let's just take a look at how you can copy\ncan copy\ncan copy css and javascript paths directly\ncss and javascript paths directly\ncss and javascript paths directly from your dom structure and by this what\nfrom your dom structure and by this what\nfrom your dom structure and by this what i mean is let's say if you want to\ni mean is let's say if you want to\ni mean is let's say if you want to get this bad boy in javascript or maybe\nget this bad boy in javascript or maybe\nget this bad boy in javascript or maybe like this\nlike this\nlike this li tag right so how do you do that and\nli tag right so how do you do that and\nli tag right so how do you do that and the way you do that you can either go\nthe way you do that you can either go\nthe way you do that you can either go ahead and you know sit down and compute\nahead and you know sit down and compute\nahead and you know sit down and compute how you know just just a selector how\nhow you know just just a selector how\nhow you know just just a selector how you should select it\nyou should select it\nyou should select it or you can just right click on this go\nor you can just right click on this go\nor you can just right click on this go to this copy\nto this copy\nto this copy and then select just click on either\nand then select just click on either\nand then select just click on either copy js path\ncopy js path\ncopy js path or select on copy selector so let's say\nor select on copy selector so let's say\nor select on copy selector so let's say if i click on the copy selector\nif i click on the copy selector\nif i click on the copy selector and if i add a new style and paste it\nand if i add a new style and paste it\nand if i add a new style and paste it you're gonna see\nyou're gonna see\nyou're gonna see it actually gave me a nice little\nit actually gave me a nice little\nit actually gave me a nice little description of body ul\ndescription of body ul\ndescription of body ul and li ms child of one which is a pretty\nand li ms child of one which is a pretty\nand li ms child of one which is a pretty solid selector right\nsolid selector right\nsolid selector right you won't really get behind you know you\nyou won't really get behind you know you\nyou won't really get behind you know you won't really be selecting wrong elements\nwon't really be selecting wrong elements\nwon't really be selecting wrong elements because\nbecause\nbecause there's only a single ul uh which is a\nthere's only a single ul uh which is a\nthere's only a single ul uh which is a direct child of body and there's only\ndirect child of body and there's only\ndirect child of body and there's only single li which is nhl one\nsingle li which is nhl one\nsingle li which is nhl one so if i have a color of green or like\nso if i have a color of green or like\nso if i have a color of green or like purple or whatever\npurple or whatever\npurple or whatever you can see it works just fine right and\nyou can see it works just fine right and\nyou can see it works just fine right and you don't really have to\nyou don't really have to\nyou don't really have to spend a lot of mind calculating what the\nspend a lot of mind calculating what the\nspend a lot of mind calculating what the selector should be\nselector should be\nselector should be now there are obviously other ways to\nnow there are obviously other ways to\nnow there are obviously other ways to select this element as well you know\nselect this element as well you know\nselect this element as well you know ulli\nulli\nulli first child there are other valid\nfirst child there are other valid\nfirst child there are other valid selectors as well but\nselectors as well but\nselectors as well but it gives you in my opinion what i have\nit gives you in my opinion what i have\nit gives you in my opinion what i have seen it gives you the strictest possible\nseen it gives you the strictest possible\nseen it gives you the strictest possible selector\nselector\nselector right so there's that\nright so there's that\nright so there's that next thing is uh how do you copy\nnext thing is uh how do you copy\nnext thing is uh how do you copy the javascript path and if you already\nthe javascript path and if you already\nthe javascript path and if you already have the css selector\nhave the css selector\nhave the css selector javascript is sort of easy you just have\njavascript is sort of easy you just have\njavascript is sort of easy you just have to wrap it in document.queryselector or\nto wrap it in document.queryselector or\nto wrap it in document.queryselector or

on\njust click on copy and copy.js path and if you go to\ncopy and copy.js path and if you go to\ncopy and copy.js path and if you go to console now\nconsole now\nconsole now i think we have a old text if you go to\ni think we have a old text if you go to\ni think we have a old text if you go to console you can see\nconsole you can see\nconsole you can see it gives you a nice sort of line of\nit gives you a nice sort of line of\nit gives you a nice sort of line of documented query selector and you have\ndocumented query selector and you have\ndocumented query selector and you have your element here\nyour element here\nyour element here right but again why would you do\nright but again why would you do\nright but again why would you do something like this when you can just go\nsomething like this when you can just go\nsomething like this when you can just go ahead click on this\nahead click on this\nahead click on this and go to dollar zero and just write it\nand go to dollar zero and just write it\nand go to dollar zero and just write it we have already discussed this\nwe have already discussed this\nwe have already discussed this but yeah this might be useful if you're\nbut yeah this might be useful if you're\nbut yeah this might be useful if you're just trying to copy this to a file or\njust trying to copy this to a file or\njust trying to copy this to a file or something\nsomething\nsomething so yeah that's pretty much it for this\nso yeah that's pretty much it for this\nso yeah that's pretty much it for this video and\nvideo and\nvideo and uh that's all i'm gonna see you in the\nuh that's all i'm gonna see you in the\nuh that's all i'm gonna see you in the next one\nnext one\nnext one really soon hey everyone welcome back\nreally soon hey everyone welcome back\nreally soon hey everyone welcome back and in this video\nand in this video\nand in this video let us just go ahead and take a look at\nlet us just go ahead and take a look at\nlet us just go ahead and take a look at this color selector which is pretty\nthis color selector which is pretty\nthis color selector which is pretty interesting to me\ninteresting to me\ninteresting to me actually uh and the reason for\nactually uh and the reason for\nactually uh and the reason for this is because this is a very powerful\nthis is because this is a very powerful\nthis is because this is a very powerful tool\ntool\ntool in the browser itself and let me just\nin the browser itself and let me just\nin the browser itself and let me just tell you why for example if i go to this\ntell you why for example if i go to this\ntell you why for example if i go to this first li\nfirst li\nfirst li when you click on this color it actually\nwhen you click on this color it actually\nwhen you click on this color it actually gives you a very nice\ngives you a very nice\ngives you a very nice interface of selecting the color and you\ninterface of selecting the color and you\ninterface of selecting the color and you can see the life changes happening in\ncan see the life changes happening in\ncan see the life changes happening in the in the browser itself\nthe in the browser itself\nthe in the browser itself but what is more interesting to me is\nbut what is more interesting to me is\nbut what is more interesting to me is that if you drag on\nthat if you drag on\nthat if you drag on to the web page it actually gives you a\nto the web page it actually gives you a\nto the web page it actually gives you a magnifier\nmagnifier\nmagnifier which helps you to pick a color from a\nwhich helps you to pick a color from a\nwhich helps you to pick a color from a single individual pixel as well so that\nsingle individual pixel as well so that\nsingle individual pixel as well so that is how cool is that\nis how cool is that\nis how cool is that let's just go to for example google and\nlet's just go to for example google and\nlet's just go to for example google and now\nnow\nnow let's say i want to get an exact hex\nlet's say i want to get an exact hex\nlet's say i want to get an exact hex value\nvalue\nvalue of this yellow right here now all these\nof this yellow right here now all these\nof this yellow right here now all these photoshop guys are just gonna right\nphotoshop guys are just gonna right\nphotoshop guys are just gonna right click save this image and you know just\nclick save this image and you know just\nclick save this image and you know just get started with it\nget started with it\nget started with it but what if i tell you there's a much\nbut what if i tell you there's a much\nbut what if i tell you there's a much easier way to just get this value\neasier way to just get this value\neasier way to just get this value directly from your browser\ndirectly from your browser\ndirectly from your browser and the way you'll just do it is just\nand the way you'll just do it is just\nand the way you'll just do it is just you know i don't know just go ahead and\nyou know i don't know just go ahead and\nyou know i don't know just go ahead and set a\nset a\nset a random property which involves a color\nrandom property which involves a color\nrandom property which involves a color anywhere and click on this color\nanywhere and click on this color\nanywhere and click on this color and then once you have the magnifier\nand then once you have the magnifier\nand then once you have the magnifier with you just go ahead\nwith you just go ahead\nwith you just go ahead and just carefully select any pixel\nand just carefully select any pixel\nand just carefully select any pixel right here and you have the hex value of\nright here and you have the hex value of\nright here and you have the hex value of the color\nthe color\nthe color so that is cool you know google is using\nso that is cool you know google is using\nso that is cool you know google is using fabc04\nfabc04\nfabc04 as the yellow of the o and just to be\nas the yellow of the o and just to be\nas the yellow of the o and just to be extra sure you can just click on it\nextra sure you can just click on it\nextra sure you can just click on it on multiple different places so that you\non multiple different places so that you\non multiple different places so that you do not have selected an edge or\ndo not have selected an edge or\ndo not have selected an edge or something\nsomething\nsomething but yeah that's that's a solid yellow\nbut yeah that's that's a solid yellow\nbut yeah that's that's a solid yellow right\nright\nright so that's one neat trick another one is\nso that's one neat trick another one is\nso that's one neat trick another one is that if you click on this\nthat if you click on this\nthat if you click on this sometimes let's see if i have for\nsometimes let's see if i have for\nsometimes let's see if i have for example if i am going ahead and\nexample if i am going ahead and\nexample if i am going ahead and selecting this element\nselecting this element\nselecting this element so if i go ahead and select this\nso if i go ahead and select this\nso if i go ahead and select this background color as\nbackground color as\nbackground color as i don't know and this color right here\ni don't know and this color right here\ni don't know and this color right here as well it does not have a contrast\nas well it does not have a contrast\nas well it does not have a contrast information for this too\ninformation for this too\ninformation for this too but sometimes if possible what google\nbut sometimes if possible what google\nbut sometimes if possible what google would do\nwould do\nwould do is that will give you some contrast\nis that will give you some contrast\nis that will give you some contrast information\ninformation\ninformation that means your how how contrasty\nthat means your how how contrasty\nthat means your how how contrasty your text is compared to its background\nyour text is compared to its background\nyour text is compared to its background color so if it's a big no-no for example\ncolor so if it's a big no-no for example\ncolor so if it's a big no-no for example i think we got one\ni think we got one\ni think we got one in the in the codem playground i guess\nin the in the codem playground i guess\nin the in the codem playground i guess maybe not let's just go ahead and open\nmaybe not let's just go ahead and open\nmaybe not let's just go ahead and open this again\nthis again\nthis again if i go ahead and give this one a color\nif i go ahead and give this one a color\nif i go ahead and give this one a color of let's say green\nof let's say green\nof let's say green and click on this you can see that we\nand click on this you can see that we\nand click on this you can see that we get a contrast ratio of 4.09\nget a contrast ratio of 4.09\nget a contrast ratio of 4.09 which is not recommended so if i try to\nwhich is not recommended so if i try to\nwhich is not recommended so if i try to go towards more of the white side you\ngo towards more of the white side you\ngo towards more of the white side you can see that it it\ncan see that it it\ncan see that it it it starts giving a higher contrast ratio\nit starts giving a higher contrast ratio\nit starts giving a higher contrast ratio which is a double\nwhich is a double\nwhich is a double good thing double thumbs up so this is\ngood thing double thumbs up so this is\ngood thing double thumbs up so this is more like readability of text you can\nmore like readability of text you can\nmore like readability of text you can see contrast ratio is one here and\nsee contrast ratio is one here and\nsee contrast ratio is one here and we obviously know that i cannot see a\nwe obviously know that i cannot see a\nwe obviously know that i cannot see a single thing on the screen\nsingle thing on the screen\nsingle thing on the screen so you know you can just use that as\nso you know you can just use that as\nso you know you can just use that as well for accessibility and stuff\nwell for accessibility and stuff\nwell for accessibility and stuff so that's this that that's another trick\nso that's this that that's another trick\nso that's this that that's another trick the third one\nthe third one\nthe third one is that you can click on this to toggle\nis that you can click on this to toggle\nis that you can click on this to toggle between different formats right\nbetween different formats right\nbetween different formats right so you see right here you also you have\nso you see right here you also you have\nso you see right here you also you have the hex value\nthe hex value\nthe hex value once you click on this it toggles to rgb\nonce you click on this it toggles to rgb\nonce you click on this it toggles to rgb and you know these modern browsers try\nand you know these modern browsers try\nand you know these modern browsers try to omit the commas\nto omit the commas\nto omit the commas although the commas will also work the\nalthough the commas will also work the\nalthough the commas will also work the new syntax also supports\nnew syntax also supports\nnew syntax also supports these values without commas so that's\nthese values without commas so that's\nthese values without commas so that's something you should know as a css\nsomething you should know as a css\nsomething you should know as a css developer\ndeveloper\ndeveloper right then there's also this new cool\nright then there's also this new cool\nright then there's also this new cool kit in the town that is the hsl\nkit in the town that is the hsl\nkit in the town that is the hsl not really new it has been for a very\nnot really new it has been for a very\nnot really new it has been for a very long time but you know this is also a\nlong time but you know this is also a\nlong time but you know this is also a format\nformat\nformat right but the best supported i guess in\nright but the best supported i guess in\nright but the best supported i guess in my opinion is hex value still\nmy opinion is hex value still\nmy opinion is hex value still but you have your own choices to make\nbut you have your own choices to make\nbut you have your own choices to make but anyway this is uh yeah that's that's\nbut anyway this is uh yeah that's that's\nbut anyway this is uh yeah that's that's basically it for the color sort of thing\nbasically it for the color sort of thing\nbasically it for the color sort of thing you can also scroll over this color to\nyou can also scroll over this color to\nyou can also scroll over this color to horizontally move\nhorizontally move\nhorizontally move uh i don't know what what exactly that\nuh i don't know what what exactly that\nuh i don't know what what exactly that is but\nis but\nis but yeah it's actually increasing the value\nyeah it's actually increasing the value\nyeah it's actually increasing the value in the hex code which\nin the hex code which\nin the hex code which sort of follows a weird pattern oh i did\nsort of follows a weird pattern oh i did\nsort of follows a weird pattern oh i did not know\nnot know\nnot know i never like played played around by\ni never like played played around by\ni never like played played around by uh browsing the color like\nuh browsing the color like\nuh browsing the color like scrolling the color like this so it\nscrolling the color like this so it\nscrolling the color like this so it seems like it\nseems like it\nseems like it it is following a circle i don't know\nit is following a circle i don't know\nit is following a circle i don't know if anybody knows what this pattern is\nif anybody knows what this pattern is\nif

look at them we look at this\nlook at this\nlook at this so this is how it is things are\nso this is how it is things are\nso this is how it is things are organized right\norganized right\norganized right now\nnow\nnow let's see that when i click on this\nlet's see that when i click on this\nlet's see that when i click on this button\nbutton\nbutton it automatically run this code and i\nit automatically run this code and i\nit automatically run this code and i know that this function is being called\nknow that this function is being called\nknow that this function is being called right so so how do i stop the code in\nright so so how do i stop the code in\nright so so how do i stop the code in the debugger so the first thing which i\nthe debugger so the first thing which i\nthe debugger so the first thing which i can do is i can simply put a breakpoint\ncan do is i can simply put a breakpoint\ncan do is i can simply put a breakpoint by clicking here if it turns blue it is\nby clicking here if it turns blue it is\nby clicking here if it turns blue it is a the breakpoint is active if you click\na the breakpoint is active if you click\na the breakpoint is active if you click again it gets the bug it's it get\nagain it gets the bug it's it get\nagain it gets the bug it's it get deleted or you can create a breakpoint\ndeleted or you can create a breakpoint\ndeleted or you can create a breakpoint using right click and add breakpoint\nusing right click and add breakpoint\nusing right click and add breakpoint for the timing we'll just say add\nfor the timing we'll just say add\nfor the timing we'll just say add breakpoint right and if i click here\nbreakpoint right and if i click here\nbreakpoint right and if i click here what does it say pause then develop\nwhat does it say pause then develop\nwhat does it say pause then develop right and the code has stopped okay\nright and the code has stopped okay\nright and the code has stopped okay now let's just first look at these three\nnow let's just first look at these three\nnow let's just first look at these three these these some of these buttons this\nthese these some of these buttons this\nthese these some of these buttons this one means you just i want to execute it\none means you just i want to execute it\none means you just i want to execute it you don't want to debug\nyou don't want to debug\nyou don't want to debug this means you want to debug it but you\nthis means you want to debug it but you\nthis means you want to debug it but you will you want to step over each call for\nwill you want to step over each call for\nwill you want to step over each call for example if i click here\nexample if i click here\nexample if i click here it goes to next one\nit goes to next one\nit goes to next one it calls alert okay now here\nit calls alert okay now here\nit calls alert okay now here yes here it is a function called nested\nyes here it is a function called nested\nyes here it is a function called nested call where this my account is being\ncall where this my account is being\ncall where this my account is being passed so one thing which i can do is\npassed so one thing which i can do is\npassed so one thing which i can do is either i want to go inside debug this\neither i want to go inside debug this\neither i want to go inside debug this function\nfunction\nfunction or i just want to skip over so for\nor i just want to skip over so for\nor i just want to skip over so for example i want to skip over so that's\nexample i want to skip over so that's\nexample i want to skip over so that's what this step over function does\nwhat this step over function does\nwhat this step over function does and you are able to see this message all\nand you are able to see this message all\nand you are able to see this message all right and if i just say process\nright and if i just say process\nright and if i just say process that's okay\nthat's okay\nthat's okay now\nlet's again look at it and let's see how\nlet's again look at it and let's see how does this step in support work so if i\ndoes this step in support work so if i\ndoes this step in support work so if i now click here\nnow click here\nnow click here and it goes again here and i just want\nand it goes again here and i just want\nand it goes again here and i just want to step over this\nto step over this\nto step over this okay\nokay\nokay now i want to debug this so i go inside\nnow i want to debug this so i go inside\nnow i want to debug this so i go inside this one f11 so it goes here right for\nthis one f11 so it goes here right for\nthis one f11 so it goes here right for example now i feel that everything looks\nexample now i feel that everything looks\nexample now i feel that everything looks okay i don't want to debug it i want to\nokay i don't want to debug it i want to\nokay i don't want to debug it i want to come out of this so that's where you\ncome out of this so that's where you\ncome out of this so that's where you have stepped\nhave stepped\nhave stepped right so that's how you basically\nright so that's how you basically\nright so that's how you basically do this step by step and then you can\ndo this step by step and then you can\ndo this step by step and then you can just simply say\njust simply say\njust simply say click click on resume and everything is\nclick click on resume and everything is\nclick click on resume and everything is done so these are the buttons basically\ndone so these are the buttons basically\ndone so these are the buttons basically which you use to\nwhich you use to\nwhich you use to you know move to towards different codes\nyou know move to towards different codes\nyou know move to towards different codes okay so now since we have seen how\nokay so now since we have seen how\nokay so now since we have seen how how these different uh\nhow these different uh\nhow these different uh options are there right and now what you\noptions are there right and now what you\noptions are there right and now what you can do is that for example you can place\ncan do is that for example you can place\ncan do is that for example you can place multiple breakpoint i can place a\nmultiple breakpoint i can place a\nmultiple breakpoint i can place a breakpoint here\nbreakpoint here\nbreakpoint here here and here\nhere and here\nhere and here okay so\nokay so\nokay so for example if i do this\nfor example if i do this\nfor example if i do this right now it stops here i say resume\nright now it stops here i say resume\nright now it stops here i say resume message is coming and again it goes to\nmessage is coming and again it goes to\nmessage is coming and again it goes to here right and then again step by step\nhere right and then again step by step\nhere right and then again step by step it will start it will stop at every\nit will start it will stop at every\nit will start it will stop at every point every break point and it will show\npoint every break point and it will show\npoint every break point and it will show me everything right but let's say you\nme everything right but let's say you\nme everything right but let's say you don't you said that okay this breakpoint\ndon't you said that okay this breakpoint\ndon't you said that okay this breakpoint is okay rest i think a lot okay i just\nis okay rest i think a lot okay i just\nis okay rest i think a lot okay i just want to proceed i don't want to stop\nwant to proceed i don't want to stop\nwant to proceed i don't want to stop right so what you can do is you you see\nright so what you can do is you you see\nright so what you can do is you you see this there's a down arrow\nthis there's a down arrow\nthis there's a down arrow the\nthe\nthe you just click on it\nyou just click on it\nyou just click on it and you hold the mouse button right and\nand you hold the mouse button right and\nand you hold the mouse button right and then you click on the second option\nthen you click on the second option\nthen you click on the second option so it basically goes through everything\nso it basically goes through everything\nso it basically goes through everything so what it does is it basically uh skips\nso what it does is it basically uh skips\nso what it does is it basically uh skips through rest of the break points right\nthrough rest of the break points right\nthrough rest of the break points right so another option is for example you\nso another option is for example you\nso another option is for example you don't have these breakpoint you just\ndon't have these breakpoint you just\ndon't have these breakpoint you just surface breakpoint and you say i want to\nsurface breakpoint and you say i want to\nsurface breakpoint and you say i want to debug\ndebug\ndebug so\nso\nso it comes here but you don't want you\nit comes here but you don't want you\nit comes here but you don't want you want to skip everything and you want to\nwant to skip everything and you want to\nwant to skip everything and you want to directly in the code to directly go here\ndirectly in the code to directly go here\ndirectly in the code to directly go here just click here\njust click here\njust click here and\nand\nand do a\ndo a\ndo a continue here that's it\ncontinue here that's it\ncontinue here that's it and first message come line number three\nand first message come line number three\nand first message come line number three and it stops\nand it stops\nand it stops so that's how you can basically\nso that's how you can basically\nso that's how you can basically skips through\nskips through\nskips through the the few lines and the codes and you\nthe the few lines and the codes and you\nthe the few lines and the codes and you can directly go there okay sometimes\ncan directly go there okay sometimes\ncan directly go there okay sometimes what you need to do is for example you\nwhat you need to do is for example you\nwhat you need to do is for example you have executed everything and you are at\nhave executed everything and you are at\nhave executed everything and you are at these somewhere in between but you want\nthese somewhere in between but you want\nthese somewhere in between but you want to restart it right you want to go to\nto restart it right you want to go to\nto restart it right you want to go to the beginning and start again this whole\nthe beginning and start again this whole\nthe beginning and start again this whole function so what you can do is\nfunction so what you can do is\nfunction so what you can do is uh\nuh\nuh go here on the call set to a restart\ngo here on the call set to a restart\ngo here on the call set to a restart frame right this is one way you can do\nframe right this is one way you can do\nframe right this is one way you can do it so all i need to do is restart frame\nit so all i need to do is restart frame\nit so all i need to do is restart frame and goes to the beginning right and it\nand goes to the beginning right and it\nand goes to the beginning right and it starts again that's how you basically\nthe starts execution of this function\nthe starts execution of this function and what you see here is let's just\nand what you see here is let's just\nand what you see here is let's just focus on as of now on call stack so this\nfocus on as of now on call stack so this\nfocus on as of now on call stack so this is like in what order\nis like in what order\nis like in what order this this function is being called for\nthis this function is being called for\nthis this function is being called for example first is you see\nexample first is you see\nexample first is you see there's a button in our index.html which\nthere's a button in our index.html which\nthere's a button in our index.html which has on click event which call this and\nhas on click event which call this and\nhas on click event which call this and that's where it comes right\nthat's where it comes right\nthat's where it comes right and\nand\nand this this is called as uh the trace and\nthis this is called as uh the trace and\nthis this is called as uh the trace and you can also do a right click copy stack\nyou can also do a right click copy stack\nyou can also do a right click copy stack trace\ntrace\ntrace so it basically what it does is you can\nso it basically what it does is you can\nso it basically what it does is you can see there's a staff trace is copied\nsee there's a staff trace is copied\nsee there's a staff trace is copied right\nright\nright and\nand\nand then you can basically\nthen you can basically\nthen you can basically uh kind of uh\nuh kind of uh\nuh kind of uh move through your\nmove through your\nmove through your you know check through troubleshoot your\nyou know check through troubleshoot your\nyou know check through troubleshoot your issues using calls check that how the\nissues using calls check that how the\nissues using calls check that how the calls have happened and where probably\ncalls have happened and where probably\ncalls have happened and where probably an issue can lie right\nan issue can lie right\nan issue can lie right so let me just\nso let me just\nso let me just step over to the next function and just\nstep over to the next function and just\nstep over to the next function and just show you how do you check the variable\nshow you how do you check the variable\nshow you how do you check the variable value one is you can see there is\nvalue one is you can see there is\nvalue one is you can see there is already available variable value coming\nalready available variable value coming\nalready available variable value coming my count is equal to 1 another way is\nmy count is equal to 1 another way is\nmy count is equal to 1 another way is you can just hover over it you will see\nyou can just hover over it you will see\nyou can just hover over it you will see this value or\nthis value or\nthis value or you can just copy this variable you can\nyou can just copy this variable you can\nyou can just copy this variable you can go here it shows that another way is\ngo here it shows that another way is\ngo here it shows that another way is if you look at this scope there is a\nif you look at this scope there is a\nif you look at this scope there is a local scope\nlocal scope\nlocal scope where you see this my account variable\nwhere you see this my account variable\nwhere you see this my account variable one and you can modify it from here also\none and you can modify it from here also\none and you can modify it from here also right\nright\nright if you just double click you can modify\nif you just double click you can modify\nif you just double click you can modify it\nit\nit very simple right so let me just say\nvery simple right so let me just say\nvery simple right so let me just say okay okay that's fine that's that's okay\nokay okay that's fine that's that's okay\nokay okay that's fine that's that's okay okay\nokay\nokay so now we see one type of a break point\nso now we see one type of a break point\nso now we see one type of a break point there are multiple type of break points\nthere are multiple type of break points\nthere are multiple type of break points which we will see\nwhich we will see\nwhich we will see so one is the\nso one is the\nso one is the this is simple breakpoint right and\nthis is simple breakpoint right and\nthis is simple breakpoint right and there is if you do a right click for\nthere is if you do a right click for\nthere is if you do a right click for example if i do a right click here\nexample if i do a right click here\nexample if i do a right click here there's a conditional breakpoint so this\nthere's a conditional breakpoint so this\nthere's a conditional breakpoint so this breakpoint will be triggered based on\nbreakpoint will be triggered based on\nbreakpoint will be triggered based on certain condition it will not be\ncertain condition it will not be\ncertain condition it will not be triggered like\ntriggered like\ntriggered like always so why what i can do is\nalways so why what i can do is\nalways so why what i can do is if my count is equal to seven\nif my count is equal to seven\nif my count is equal to seven right double seven then only trigger it\nright double seven then only trigger it\nright double seven then only trigger it and i know that one is\nand i know that one is\nand i know that one is it will be one here then it will call\nit will be one here then it will call\nit will be one here then it will call this method nested calls one plus six is\nthis method nested calls one plus six is\nthis method nested calls one plus six is seven it will get triggered and now you\nseven it will get triggered and now you\nseven it will get triggered and now you can see this that is yellow orange right\ncan see this that is yellow orange right\ncan see this that is yellow orange right orange is kind of yellow\norange is kind of yellow\norange is kind of yellow that it will be like conditional so if i\nthat it will be like conditional so if i\nthat it will be like conditional so if i just click here\njust click here\njust click here and let me just remove this\nand let me just remove this\nand let me just remove this so now it stops here because my account\nso now it stops here because my account\nso now it stops here because my account value is 7\nvalue is 7\nvalue is 7 right\nright\nright now if i\nnow if i\nnow if i edit it right click edit i say\nedit it right click edit i say\nedit it right click edit i say this value is 6 then only stop\nthis value is 6 then only stop\nthis value is 6 then only stop and now if i click here\nand now if i click here\nand now if i click here it doesn't stop so which is the way we\nit doesn't stop so which is the way we\nit doesn't stop so which is the way we want them to be\nwant them to be\nwant them to be right so that's how these are\nright so that's how these are\nright so that's how these are conditional breakpoints one is a simple\nconditional breakpoints one is a simple\nconditional breakpoints one is a simple breakpoint\nbreakpoint\nbreakpoint another is a breakpoint is\nanother is a breakpoint is\nanother is a breakpoint is a dom break point right for example\na dom break point right for example\na dom break point right for example let me just first do one thing\nlet me just first do one

also i click disable it is disabled right and this is\ndisable it is disabled right and this is\ndisable it is disabled right and this is a different one\na different one\na different one and if i can disable blue one it will be\nand if i can disable blue one it will be\nand if i can disable blue one it will be light blue so these are all disabled\nlight blue so these are all disabled\nlight blue so these are all disabled points if i enable it right\npoints if i enable it right\npoints if i enable it right then they become enabled and i can i can\nthen they become enabled and i can i can\nthen they become enabled and i can i can see these two breakpoints under this i\nsee these two breakpoints under this i\nsee these two breakpoints under this i can also enable disable from h\ncan also enable disable from h\ncan also enable disable from h okay\nokay\nokay so now let me disable them what i will\nso now let me disable them what i will\nso now let me disable them what i will do is i say that in case this unordered\ndo is i say that in case this unordered\ndo is i say that in case this unordered list which is this complete\nlist which is this complete\nlist which is this complete break on subtree modification so if in\nbreak on subtree modification so if in\nbreak on subtree modification so if in case anything under this tree modifies\ncase anything under this tree modifies\ncase anything under this tree modifies you break you stop or in case any\nyou break you stop or in case any\nyou break you stop or in case any attribute modifies then you stop in case\nattribute modifies then you stop in case\nattribute modifies then you stop in case there is a node removal then also you\nthere is a node removal then also you\nthere is a node removal then also you stop so i say substring modification so\nstop so i say substring modification so\nstop so i say substring modification so it becomes blue right dom break point\nit becomes blue right dom break point\nit becomes blue right dom break point right so if you go here\nright so if you go here\nright so if you go here you can see there's a dom break point in\nyou can see there's a dom break point in\nyou can see there's a dom break point in everyone now if i click here\neveryone now if i click here\neveryone now if i click here you completed one exercise now it stops\nyou completed one exercise now it stops\nyou completed one exercise now it stops automatically and you can see that\nautomatically and you can see that\nautomatically and you can see that paused on subtree modification you will\npaused on subtree modification you will\npaused on subtree modification you will descendant li removed\ndescendant li removed\ndescendant li removed automatically okay so this is the dom\nautomatically okay so this is the dom\nautomatically okay so this is the dom break point if i just say okay\nbreak point if i just say okay\nbreak point if i just say okay you can see this\nyou can see this\nyou can see this this is already deleted\nthis is already deleted\nthis is already deleted okay now sometimes you want that\nokay now sometimes you want that\nokay now sometimes you want that whenever you click this button\nwhenever you click this button\nwhenever you click this button what is happening which event what is\nwhat is happening which event what is\nwhat is happening which event what is mouse click event what is happening can\nmouse click event what is happening can\nmouse click event what is happening can i listen to this event and\ni listen to this event and\ni listen to this event and can i have trigger a breakpoint yes so\ncan i have trigger a breakpoint yes so\ncan i have trigger a breakpoint yes so if you look here there's an even\nif you look here there's an even\nif you look here there's an even listener breakpoint\nlistener breakpoint\nlistener breakpoint and under it you have different things\nand under it you have different things\nand under it you have different things different events any mission canvas for\ndifferent events any mission canvas for\ndifferent events any mission canvas for us it is we'll take mouse we'll say\nus it is we'll take mouse we'll say\nus it is we'll take mouse we'll say click so whenever i click\nclick so whenever i click\nclick so whenever i click let it trigger a breakpoint so if i just\nlet it trigger a breakpoint so if i just\nlet it trigger a breakpoint so if i just click here\nclick here\nclick here so it triggers a breakpoint\nso it triggers a breakpoint\nso it triggers a breakpoint automatically it says this button type\nautomatically it says this button type\nautomatically it says this button type on click event and if i just\non click event and if i just\non click event and if i just execute it then it also automatically\nexecute it then it also automatically\nexecute it then it also automatically trigger my other breakpoints right so\ntrigger my other breakpoints right so\ntrigger my other breakpoints right so that's how it basically triggers it let\nthat's how it basically triggers it let\nthat's how it basically triggers it let me just first\nme just first\nme just first delete all these\ndelete all these\ndelete all these and show you one more thing\nbreak on and subtree okay so another\nbreak on and subtree okay so another thing is basically is for example\nthing is basically is for example\nthing is basically is for example um\num\num what you want is that you want to\nwhat you want is that you want to\nwhat you want is that you want to trigger a breakpoint when this function\ntrigger a breakpoint when this function\ntrigger a breakpoint when this function is called nested\nis called nested\nis called nested and you don't know when it will be\nand you don't know when it will be\nand you don't know when it will be called but it is globally available\ncalled but it is globally available\ncalled but it is globally available because i have\nbecause i have\nbecause i have upload unloaded this file by index.html\nupload unloaded this file by index.html\nupload unloaded this file by index.html so what i can do in control is you can\nso what i can do in control is you can\nso what i can do in control is you can say debug\nsay debug\nsay debug nested call\nnested call\nnested call okay whenever this is called you debug\nokay whenever this is called you debug\nokay whenever this is called you debug it so i just click here\nit so i just click here\nit so i just click here and\nyou see it automatically gets triggered\nyou see it automatically gets triggered nested call i did not put any breakpoint\nnested call i did not put any breakpoint\nnested call i did not put any breakpoint it got triggered automatically right\nit got triggered automatically right\nit got triggered automatically right paused on debug function it\npaused on debug function it\npaused on debug function it automatically tells you that okay this\nautomatically tells you that okay this\nautomatically tells you that okay this is how\nis how\nis how things are right\nthings are right\nthings are right okay good\nokay good\nokay good let me just reload it because the\nlet me just reload it because the\nlet me just reload it because the entries are deleted right\nentries are deleted right\nentries are deleted right and now\nand now\nand now let's see that\nlet's see that\nlet's see that another thing which i really have not\nanother thing which i really have not\nanother thing which i really have not seen is\nseen is\nseen is you can also modify these code for\nyou can also modify these code for\nyou can also modify these code for example i can say\nexample i can say\nexample i can say my account is equal to two and press\nmy account is equal to two and press\nmy account is equal to two and press save simple press save\nsave simple press save\nsave simple press save and if i click here\nand if i click here\nand if i click here you can see\nyou can see\nyou can see you completed two exercise the value\nyou completed two exercise the value\nyou completed two exercise the value gets modified right\ngets modified right\ngets modified right but if i just do a refresh\nbut if i just do a refresh\nbut if i just do a refresh and you see this value is lost\nand you see this value is lost\nand you see this value is lost right so there are\nright so there are\nright so there are two ways around it right how do you\ntwo ways around it right how do you\ntwo ways around it right how do you preserve these changes okay so what you\npreserve these changes okay so what you\npreserve these changes okay so what you can do is\ncan do is\ncan do is one way is you say that you click on\none way is you say that you click on\none way is you say that you click on this file system right and you add your\nthis file system right and you add your\nthis file system right and you add your chrome folder right this one from\nchrome folder right this one from\nchrome folder right this one from developer tools folder\ndeveloper tools folder\ndeveloper tools folder to the workspace you see allow\nto the workspace you see allow\nto the workspace you see allow and now\nand now\nand now whatever changes you will make here so\nwhatever changes you will make here so\nwhatever changes you will make here so let me just close all\nin whatever changes you make for example\nin whatever changes you make for example i make it to two\ni make it to two\ni make it to two i make it completed one two three\ni make it completed one two three\ni make it completed one two three right and uh here also i write something\nright and uh here also i write something\nright and uh here also i write something and i press save so whatever changes you\nand i press save so whatever changes you\nand i press save so whatever changes you make here right you can see them that\nmake here right you can see them that\nmake here right you can see them that they will automatically are let me just\nthey will automatically are let me just\nthey will automatically are let me just read this breakpoint\nthat one two three eight everything is\nthat one two three eight everything is getting reflected right and if you look\ngetting reflected right and if you look\ngetting reflected right and if you look at if you just press the refresh also\nat if you just press the refresh also\nat if you just press the refresh also still the changes are still right why\nstill the changes are still right why\nstill the changes are still right why because the code is it is directly\nbecause the code is it is directly\nbecause the code is it is directly modifying your file system if you look\nmodifying your file system if you look\nmodifying your file system if you look at this\nat this\nat this does this here so you can actually in\ndoes this here so you can actually in\ndoes this here so you can actually in fact modify

which i wanted to showcase is\nto showcase is\nto showcase is uh one is this not one\nlet's look at this snippet right so in\nlet's look at this snippet right so in case you want to store this\ncase you want to store this\ncase you want to store this code in the browser right so what you\ncode in the browser right so what you\ncode in the browser right so what you can do is you click here you know you go\ncan do is you click here you know you go\ncan do is you click here you know you go to here snippets okay let me go back\nto here snippets okay let me go back\nto here snippets okay let me go back again\nagain\nagain snippets and then you click on new\nsnippets and then you click on new\nsnippets and then you click on new snippet and\nsnippet and\nsnippet and you paste your code or

normally\nright and primarily in console normally\nright and primarily in console normally for example uh let's look at our code\nfor example uh let's look at our code\nfor example uh let's look at our code so so normally developers what they do\nso so normally developers what they do\nso so normally developers what they do is they\nis they\nis they they kind of log some stuff when\nthey kind of log some stuff when\nthey kind of log some stuff when something is done right for example here\nsomething is done right for example here\nsomething is done right for example here it is console.log is being used right\nit is console.log is being used right\nit is console.log is being used right let's just look at it what it does so\nlet's just look at it what it does so\nlet's just look at it what it does so for example if in sources you go you\nfor example if in sources you go you\nfor example if in sources you go you will see\nwill see\nwill see console.log is being logged\nconsole.log is being logged\nconsole.log is being logged in in nested call which is being called\nin in nested call which is being called\nin in nested call which is being called an on click event\nan on click event\nan on click event let me just click here\nlet me just click here\nlet me just click here okay okay and\nokay okay and\nokay okay and this is done so but what happens so\nthis is done so but what happens so\nthis is done so but what happens so anything which a developer wants to\nanything which a developer wants to\nanything which a developer wants to process is or wants to log is logged in\nprocess is or wants to log is logged in\nprocess is or wants to log is logged in if you look at here there are four\nif you look at here there are four\nif you look at here there are four messages\nmessages\nmessages so this is the one which was which came\nso this is the one which was which came\nso this is the one which was which came from our fees completed one two three\nfrom our fees completed one two three\nfrom our fees completed one two three nested call if we look at here\nnested call if we look at here\nnested call if we look at here this is the same right\nthis is the same right\nthis is the same right and so that these you know developers\nand so that these you know developers\nand so that these you know developers can have different kind of login\ncan have different kind of login\ncan have different kind of login messages\nmessages\nmessages and on left hand side what you see is\nand on left hand side what you see is\nand on left hand side what you see is this four messages is like for\nthis four messages is like for\nthis four messages is like for everything\neverything\neverything then in case you want to see only errors\nthen in case you want to see only errors\nthen in case you want to see only errors you can use this filter warnings info\nyou can use this filter warnings info\nyou can use this filter warnings info right whatever we have logged\nright whatever we have logged\nright whatever we have logged and user messages if\nand user messages if\nand user messages if right and in user messages these are\nright and in user messages these are\nright and in user messages these are these are like uh\nthese are like uh\nthese are like uh the locations from where those messages\nthe locations from where those messages\nthe locations from where those messages are coming for example my file dot ds\nare coming for example my file dot ds\nare coming for example my file dot ds is one message which is coming from here\nis one message which is coming from here\nis one message which is coming from here and another message is coming from live\nand another message is coming from live\nand another message is coming from live load so these are the five different\nload so these are the five different\nload so these are the five different ways to see the message right\nways to see the message right\nways to see the message right and\nand\nand you can if you want to clear it you can\nyou can if you want to clear it you can\nyou can if you want to clear it you can clear it using clear console and if you\nclear it using clear console and if you\nclear it using clear console and if you want to increase the size just control\nwant to increase the size just control\nwant to increase the size just control okay and in case you want to filter it\nokay and in case you want to filter it\nokay and in case you want to filter it you can filter that also for example if\nyou can filter that also for example if\nyou can filter that also for example if i just refresh\ni just refresh\ni just refresh right\nright\nright and i click here\nso you see there are two messages and if\nso you see there are two messages and if i want to filter for a click only click\ni want to filter for a click only click\ni want to filter for a click only click will come if i just say rdea then those\nwill come if i just say rdea then those\nwill come if i just say rdea then those will get filtered all right\nwill get filtered all right\nwill get filtered all right and then\nand then\nand then then\nthen\nthen that that's how basically the whole uh\nthat that's how basically the whole uh\nthat that's how basically the whole uh logging happens and you can view those\nlogging happens and you can view those\nlogging happens and you can view those logs now you can also\nlogs now you can also\nlogs now you can also preserve the logs in which there is a\npreserve the logs in which there is a\npreserve the logs in which there is a reload or something right if i just hit\nreload or something right if i just hit\nreload or something right if i just hit reserve log\nreserve log\nreserve log and if i do an f5\nand if i do an f5\nand if i do an f5 right you will see that this log is\nright you will see that this log is\nright you will see that this log is still there it's the previous one\nstill there it's the previous one\nstill there it's the previous one and similarly there are other options\nand similarly there are other options\nand similarly there are other options while for example you can log stm\nwhile for example you can log stm\nwhile for example you can log stm in the the\nin the the\nin the the those xhr hx request also right and you\nthose xhr hx request also right and you\nthose xhr hx request also right and you can do enable auto complete from history\ncan do enable auto complete from history\ncan do enable auto complete from history also right so let's just try to\nalso right so let's just try to\nalso right so let's just try to while we are in console let's try to\nwhile we are in console let's try to\nwhile we are in console let's try to look at how does\nlook at how does\nlook at how does this console\nthis console\nthis console okay so for example if you just want to\nokay so for example if you just want to\nokay so for example if you just want to log any messages\nlog any messages\nlog any messages you just press console and you will see\nyou just press console and you will see\nyou just press console and you will see what all different methods are available\nwhat all different methods are available\nwhat all different methods are available for example i just press enter\nfor example i just press enter\nfor example i just press enter so there is error\nso there is error\nso there is error info log one in count there and number\ninfo log one in count there and number\ninfo log one in count there and number of error in the method which are\nof error in the method which are\nof error in the method which are available that's how you can which you\navailable that's how you can which you\navailable that's how you can which you can use\ncan use\ncan use in your code to put kind of a breakpoint\nin your code to put kind of a breakpoint\nin your code to put kind of a breakpoint not breakpoints the log checkpoints in\nnot breakpoints the log checkpoints in\nnot breakpoints the log checkpoints in your case for example if you just want\nyour case for example if you just want\nyour case for example if you just want to log a message to the console you can\nto log a message to the console you can\nto log a message to the console you can just say\njust say\njust say arrow one two three and it is locked\narrow one two three and it is locked\narrow one two three and it is locked hello one two three simple\nhello one two three simple\nhello one two three simple and uh for example let's say there's a\nand uh for example let's say there's a\nand uh for example let's say there's a error there's an array not error\nerror there's an array not error\nerror there's an array not error area of salary\narea of salary\narea of salary right\nright\nright and uh\nand uh\nand uh which is like which has\nwhich is like which has\nwhich is like which has objects so it's like\nobjects so it's like\nobjects so it's like month\nmonth\nmonth as uh exact\nas uh exact\nas uh exact and uh salary\nand the thousands okay let's say there\nand the thousands okay let's say there is this one object\nand then there is another then there is\nand then there is another then there is another so there are this area of three\nanother so there are this area of three\nanother so there are this area of three objects now you want to log them so one\nobjects now you want to log them so one\nobjects now you want to log them so one way you just say\nway you just say\nway you just say console.log\nconsole.log\nconsole.log celery\ncelery\ncelery right it will just lock this very object\nright it will just lock this very object\nright it will just lock this very object and you have to\nand you have to\nand you have to drill down to right another way is to\ndrill down to right another way is to\ndrill down to right another way is to make it more meaningful and\nmake it more meaningful and\nmake it more meaningful and you know beautiful is\nyou know beautiful is\nyou know beautiful is console.table and you just say salary\nso you see it has index is one column\nso you see it has index is one column month and salary so it's just much\nmonth and salary so it's just much\nmonth and salary so it's just much better readable and all right and now\nbetter readable and all right and now\nbetter readable and all right and now for example um so so you want some let's\nfor example um so so you want some let's\nfor example um so so you want some let's say let me just clear it so one way of\nsay let me just clear it so one way of\nsay let me just clear it so one way of clearing is this\nclearing is this\nclearing is this ctrl l\nctrl l\nctrl l another way is\nanother way is\nanother way is console\ndot clear\ndot clear so it clears it\nso it clears it\nso it clears it uh\nuh\nuh due to preserve block okay yeah so once\ndue to preserve block okay yeah so once\ndue to preserve block okay yeah so once again let me just do this\nagain let me just do this\nagain let me just do this and now we run this console.clear so it\nand now we run this console.clear so it\nand now we run this console.clear so it clears it right now let's see that okay\nclears it right now let's see that okay\nclears it right now let's see that okay in case we want to log a message which\nin case we want to log a message which\nin case we want to log a message which is an error how would it look like we\nis an error how would it look like we\nis an error how would it look like we want it to stand out so what i will do\nwant it to stand out so what i will do\nwant it to stand out so what i will do is say console.log console.error\nis say console.log console.error\nis say console.log console.error test error\nit gets shown in red if you say console\nit gets shown in red if you say console dot\ndot\ndot warning\njust\njust maybe let's say\nyou have it in yellow so in case if you\nyou have it in yellow so in case if you click here it will show that test\nclick here it will show that test\nclick here it will show that test running you click here it shows testers\nrunning you click here it shows testers\nrunning you click here it shows testers if you click here it shows everything in\nif you click here it shows everything in\nif you click here it shows everything in the file using the file right it is\nthe file using the file right it is\nthe file using the file right it is mentioning it as others because we are\nmentioning it as others because we are\nmentioning it as others because we are using this\nusing this\nusing this right\nright\nright and then what you can do is uh\nand then what you can do is uh\nand then what you can do is uh once you have an error let's say\nonce you have an error let's say\nonce you have an error let's say sometimes\nsometimes\nsometimes uh\nuh\nuh you want to\nyou want to\nyou want to log a certain set of messages in a group\nlog a certain set of messages in a group\nlog a certain set of messages in a group let's say you have one function call you\nlet's say you have one function call you\nlet's say you have one function call you want to log that messages under one\nwant to log that messages under one\nwant to log that messages under one function group and then there's another\nfunction group and then there's another\nfunction group and then there's another function then you want to lock those\nfunction then you want to lock those\nfunction then you want to lock those messages\nmessages\nmessages how do you do that so what you do is you\nhow do you do that so what you do is you\nhow do you do that so what you do is you say control dot\ngroup was let's say g1\ngroup was let's say g1 right\nright\nright and then you say\nand then you say\nand then you say console dot\nconsole dot\nconsole dot log\nlog\nlog hello\nhello\nhello i'm\ni'm\ni'm imagining i'm inside a function so\nimagining i'm inside a function so\nimagining i'm inside a function so console.error\nthese are thrown from one function\nthese are thrown from one function okay and i'm logging it as under g1\nokay and i'm logging it as under g1\nokay and i'm logging it as under g1 function name let's say there is another\nfunction name let's say there is another\nfunction name let's say there is another one which is like\none which is like\none which is like g2\ng2\ng2 right\nright\nright and\nand\nand that's how those are drawn so whatever\nthat's how those are drawn so whatever\nthat's how those are drawn so whatever you press enter you see this\nyou press enter you see this\nyou press enter you see this so there are two groups g1 g1 has yellow\nso there are two groups g1 g1 has yellow\nso there are two groups g1 g1 has yellow hello and error right so you can use\nhello and error right so you can use\nhello and error right so you can use these what if i let's say let me do that\nthese what if i let's say let me do that\nthese what if i let's say let me do that what if i just use this right\nwhat if i just use this right\nwhat if i just use this right and\nand\nand i want to log that let me close this\ni want to log that let me close this\ni want to log that let me close this style\nstyle\nstyle that\nwill just\nwill just so it will say\nso it will say\nso it will say on click event right\non click event right\non click event right and\nand\nand i just say group end\ni just say group end\ni just say group end right and let's not have it as console\nright and let's not have it as console\nright and let's not have it as console we say console.log\nwe say console.log\nwe say console.log and we say\nand we say\nand we say console dot\nconsole dot\nconsole dot error so we are logging two messages\nerror so we are logging two messages\nerror so we are logging two messages just for our tracking\njust for our tracking\njust for our tracking and now\nand now\nand now what i will do is in case this function\nwhat i will do is in case this function\nwhat i will do is in case this function is also call\nis also call\nis also call we will log that also\nwe will log that also\nwe will log that also right and then we say\nand this key right\nand this key right and i just press save and because it is\nand i just press save and because it is\nand i just press save and because it is live server so now\nlive server so now\nlive server so now as of now the clear everything is clear\nas of now the clear everything is clear\nas of now the clear everything is clear right if i click here\nwhy there is alert\nwhy there is alert console also let me\nyeah you remember why there is an alert\nyeah you remember why there is an alert because the changes are coming from this\nbecause the changes are coming from this\nbecause the changes are coming from this right so let's just remove it\nright so let's just remove it\nright so let's just remove it and delete all our rights because there\nand delete all our rights because there\nand delete all our rights because there is an override and now if i just press\nis an override and now if i just press\nis an override and now if i just press this button\nand now you see this red one shows one\nand now you see this red one shows one error one warning and one\nerror one warning and one\nerror one warning and one okay so we're going to go to this you\nokay so we're going to go to this you\nokay so we're going to go to this you see on click event then you have\nsee on click event then you have\nsee on click event then you have you completed one x one two three\nyou completed one x one two three\nyou completed one x one two three exercise and then you say nested call\nexercise and then you say nested call\nexercise and then you say nested call then there is this\nthen there is this\nthen there is this right and if you look here\nright and if you look here\nright and if you look here why it is\nwhy it is\nwhy it is you know kind of not closed here is\nyou know kind of not closed here is\nyou know kind of not closed here is because\nbecause\nbecause if you look in the code\nthis call is before this call so what i\nthis call is before this call so what i can do is maybe\ncan do is maybe\ncan do is maybe i can say\ni can say\ni can say it like this\nit like this\nit like this right you call it let's just see it as a\nright you call it let's just see it as a\nright you call it let's just see it as a group complete one so if i now click\ngroup complete one so if i now click\ngroup complete one so if i now click here so you see there are two groups\nhere so you see there are two groups\nhere so you see there are two groups so that's how we use this okay\nso that's how we use this okay\nso that's how we use this okay i think uh\ni think uh\ni think uh one thing is remaining related to\none thing is remaining related to\none thing is remaining related to controller which is console. assert okay\ncontroller which is console. assert okay\ncontroller which is console. assert okay so that's like\nhow do we do is let's say we have\nhow do we do is let's say we have let's\nlet's\nlet's let's say we have variable a is equal to\nlet's say we have variable a is equal to\nlet's say we have variable a is equal to 10\n10\n10 and where b is equal to 20\nand where b is equal to 20\nand where b is equal to 20 right\nright\nright so now\nso now\nso now what you see is like\nwhat you see is like\nwhat you see is like that\nthat\nthat we want to say that\nc is equal to\nc is equal to b is\nb is\nb is a is less than 10\na is less than 10\na is less than 10 a is less than b\na is less than b\na is less than b right it has these messages\nright it has these messages\nright it has these messages so now how you can use console dot\nbasically you want to pass the condition\nbasically you want to pass the condition first condition is\nfirst condition is\nfirst condition is b a is less than b\nb a is less than b\nb a is less than b okay and then what do you say is\nokay and then what do you say is\nokay and then what do you say is that\nthat\nthat what is the data you say my data is a\nwhat is the data you say my data is a\nwhat is the data you say my data is a comma b\ncomma b\ncomma b right\ncomma\ncomma c\nright and if this and you just execute\nright and if this and you just execute it right\nit right\nit right and if\nand if\nand if a is less than b this result condition\na is less than b this result condition\na is less than b this result condition is true which is okay and if it relates\nis true which is okay and if it relates\nis true which is okay and if it relates this\nthis\nthis assertion field because a is not greater\nassertion field because a is not greater\nassertion field because a is not greater than b so it logs the data also\nthan b so it logs the data also\nthan b so it logs the data also clear so it's like\nclear so it's like\nclear so it's like you are making some version is less than\nyou are making some version is less than\nyou are making some version is less than b with this data if this assertion fails\nb with this data if this assertion fails\nb with this data if this assertion fails which in this case it has failed so now\nwhich in this case it has failed so now\nwhich in this case it has failed so now you can have little option so you can\nyou can have little

let's say i want to\nanything even if let's say i want to\nanything even if let's say i want to remove this for example this one\nremove this for example this one\nremove this for example this one right what i will do is i'll say copy js\nright what i will do is i'll say copy js\nright what i will do is i'll say copy js path i can try it here only\npath i can try it here only\npath i can try it

way for this is that\none way for this is that i write it here but since we now\ni write it here but since we now\ni write it here but since we now understood what is console so we will\nunderstood what is console so we will\nunderstood what is console so we will actually you know do it interactively in\nactually you know do it interactively in\nactually you know do it interactively in console for example if i click here\nconsole for example if i click here\nconsole for example if i click here i go to console\ni go to console\ni go to console and we have a global upgrade local\nand we have

lighthouse and performance is what\nso lighthouse and performance is what\nso lighthouse and performance is what will be useful\nwill be useful\nwill be useful so in our next one we will i like to\nso in our next one we will i like to\nso in our next one we will i like to look at security\nlook at security\nlook at security and memory and then that will be like\nand memory and then that will be like\nand memory and then that will be like our end of the\nour end of the\nour end of the course\nso in this last lesson we'll talk about\nso in this last lesson we'll talk about briefly about memory and security and in\nbriefly about memory and security and in\nbriefly about memory and security and in case you see don't see these tabs you\ncase you see don't see these tabs you\ncase you see don't see these tabs you can click here and go to more tools and\ncan click here and go to more tools and\ncan click here and go to more tools and you can choose from here\nyou can choose from here\nyou can

right\ngoogle.com right and uh\nthen i see\nthen i see this security tab\nthis security tab\nthis security tab let's just uh let it open\nlet's just uh let it open\nlet's just uh let it open yeah\nyeah\nyeah so now you will see here is a little\nso now you will see here is a little\nso now you will see here is a little lower little bit slower so it is a\nlower little bit slower so it is a\nlower little bit slower so it is a security green and you can also see the\nsecurity green and you can also see the\nsecurity green and you can also see the certificate also what certificate

beyond this tutorial all right so\nbut beyond this tutorial all right so we're basically going to be working with\nwe're basically going to be working with\nwe're basically going to be working with the the most common types of tasks that\nthe the most common types of tasks that\nthe the most common types of tasks that people use so what we're gonna do before\npeople use so what we're gonna do before\npeople use so what we're gonna do before we look at the elements tab is I'm going\nwe look at the elements tab is I'm going\nwe look at the elements tab is I'm going to show you how we can move this around\nto show you how we can move this around\nto show you how we can move this around so by default it's gonna be at the\nso by default it's gonna be at the\nso by default it's gonna be at the bottom but if you want it on the side\nbottom but if you want it on the side\nbottom but if you want it on the side you can go ahead and do that\nyou can go ahead and do that\nyou can go ahead and do that if you want it on the left side you can\nif you want it on the left side you can\nif you want it on the left side you can do that and if you want it undocked\ndo that and if you want it undocked\ndo that and if you want it undocked completely you can do that so it's it's\ncompletely you can do that so it's it's\ncompletely you can do that so it's it's another window I think what I'm gonna do\nanother window I think what I'm gonna do\nanother window I think what I'm gonna do is try it on the side just to kind of\nis try it on the side just to kind of\nis try it on the side just to kind of you know so you guys can see what's\nyou know so you guys can see what's\nyou know so you guys can see what's going on a little better usually I have\ngoing on a little better usually I have\ngoing on a little better usually I have it at the bottom but we're gonna give\nit at the bottom but we're gonna give\nit at the bottom but we're gonna give this a shot so before we look at the\nthis a shot so before we look at the\nthis a shot so before we look at the elements and inspection let's click on\nelements and inspection let's click on\nelements and inspection let's click on this little icon right here this is the\nthis little icon right here this is the\nthis little icon right here this is the device this will this will allow us to\ndevice this will this will allow us to\ndevice this will this will allow us to look at our site on different devices in\nlook at our site on different devices in\nlook at our site on different devices in different sizes first I'm just going to\ndifferent sizes first I'm just going to\ndifferent sizes first I'm just going to choose responsive and basically this is\nchoose responsive and basically this is\nchoose responsive and basically this is 1024 by 1745 so this is like a like a\n1024 by 1745 so this is like a like a\n1024 by 1745 so this is like a like a laptop view but if we want to go mobile\nlaptop view but if we want to go mobile\nlaptop view but if we want to go mobile we can click right here and this will\nwe can click right here and this will\nwe can click right here and this will give us like a mobile view if we want to\ngive us like a mobile view if we want to\ngive us like a mobile view if we want to click right here this will give us a\nclick right here this will give us a\nclick right here this will give us a larger mobile this will give us a tablet\nlarger mobile this will give us a tablet\nlarger mobile this will give us a tablet view and then we can choose actual\nview and then we can choose actual\nview and then we can choose actual devices as well so if I want to see what\ndevices as well so if I want to see what\ndevices as well so if I want to see what this looks like on an iPhone 6 we can do\nthis looks like on an iPhone 6 we can do\nthis looks like on an iPhone 6 we can do that okay we can use a little menu here\nthat okay we can use a little menu here\nthat okay we can use a little menu here if we wanted to look at on let's say a\nif we wanted to look at on let's say a\nif we wanted to look at on let's say a Galaxy s5\nGalaxy s5\nGalaxy s5 it's a little different but not much and\nit's a little different but not much and\nit's a little different but not much and it shouldn't be much different but you\nit shouldn't be much different but you\nit shouldn't be much different but you can do that you can change it from\ncan do that you can change it from\ncan do that you can change it from landscape to to portrait so it's it's a\nlandscape to to portrait so it's it's a\nlandscape to to portrait so it's it's a nice little tester to see what your site\nnice little tester to see what your site\nnice little tester to see what your site looks like on mobile devices and tablets\nlooks like on mobile devices and tablets\nlooks like on mobile devices and tablets all right so let's go ahead and close\nall right so let's go ahead and close\nall right so let's go ahead and close that out and we'll just click that icon\nthat out and we'll just click that icon\nthat out and we'll just click that icon again and now we're going to look at the\nagain and now we're going to look at the\nagain and now we're going to look at the element inspector ok are the elements\nelement inspector ok are the elements\nelement inspector ok are the elements tab now that all of this right\ntab now that all of this right\ntab now that all of this right here is the source code this is the HTML\nhere is the source code this is the HTML\nhere is the source code this is the HTML and then down here we have the CSS for\nand then down here we have the CSS for\nand then down here we have the CSS for whatever is selected here notice that\nwhatever is selected here notice that\nwhatever is selected here notice that when I hover over an element it kind of\nwhen I hover over an element it kind of\nwhen I hover over an element it kind of highlights in the browser and you'll see\nhighlights in the browser and you'll see\nhighlights in the browser and you'll see that it has some sometimes it'll have a\nthat it has some sometimes it'll have a\nthat it has some sometimes it'll have a green bar around it sometimes it'll have\ngreen bar around it sometimes it'll have\ngreen bar around it sometimes it'll have an orange bar around it what this is is\nan orange bar around it what this is is\nan orange bar around it what this is is padding and margin so this nav bar right\npadding and margin so this nav bar right\npadding and margin so this nav bar right here if I just click and select it\nhere if I just click and select it\nhere if I just click and select it you'll see that it has it has green\nyou'll see that it has it has green\nyou'll see that it has it has green border around it this is the padding if\nborder around it this is the padding if\nborder around it this is the padding if I go over the let's go and showcase and\nI go over the let's go and showcase and\nI go over the let's go and showcase and let's hover over container you'll see\nlet's hover over container you'll see\nlet's hover over container you'll see that there's actually orange on the side\nthat there's actually orange on the side\nthat there's actually orange on the side as well that's the margin a container\nas well that's the margin a container\nas well that's the margin a container has margin auto meaning that it puts the\nhas margin auto meaning that it puts the\nhas margin auto meaning that it puts the same the same amount of margin on both\nsame the same amount of margin on both\nsame the same amount of margin on both sides and that's what you're seeing it\nsides and that's what you're seeing it\nsides and that's what you're seeing it also has a little bit of padding so it\nalso has a little bit of padding so it\nalso has a little bit of padding so it has the orange and green okay now let's\nhas the orange and green okay now let's\nhas the orange and green okay now let's say we want to select an item in the\nsay we want to select an item in the\nsay we want to select an item in the browser and then have it highlight over\nbrowser and then have it highlight over\nbrowser and then have it highlight over here so basically the opposite what we\nhere so basically the opposite what we\nhere so basically the opposite what we can do is click on this this little icon\ncan do is click on this this little icon\ncan do is click on this this little icon here this arrow in the box and then we\nhere this arrow in the box and then we\nhere this arrow in the box and then we can go and we can select what we want so\ncan go and we can select what we want so\ncan go and we can select what we want so if we want to select this h1 right here\nif we want to select this h1 right here\nif we want to select this h1 right here we can go ahead and click it and it'll\nwe can go ahead and click it and it'll\nwe can go ahead and click it and it'll bring it to us over here in the elements\nbring it to us over here in the elements\nbring it to us over here in the elements tab alright and while this is selected\ntab alright and while this is selected\ntab alright and while this is selected down here or it'll show us any CSS that\ndown here or it'll show us any CSS that\ndown here or it'll show us any CSS that pertains to that element so notice that\npertains to that element so notice that\npertains to that element so notice that this h1 has a class of display too as a\nthis h1 has a class of display too as a\nthis h1 has a class of display too as a class of mt5 and PT 5 which are all\nclass of mt5 and PT 5 which are all\nclass of mt5 and PT 5 which are all bootstrap classes by the way a lot of\nbootstrap classes by the way a lot of\nbootstrap classes by the way a lot of the stuff we're gonna see our bootstrap\nthe stuff we're gonna see our bootstrap\nthe stuff we're gonna see our bootstrap classes so if we go down here it'll\nclasses so if we go down here it'll\nclasses so if we go down here it'll actually give us the styles for PT 5 mt\nactually give us the styles for PT 5 mt\nactually give us the styles for PT 5 mt 5 display - h1 itself anything that\n5 display - h1 itself anything that\n5 display - h1 itself anything that pertains to this selector right here ok\npertains to this selector right here ok\npertains to this selector right here ok not only that but it shows us the file\nnot only that but it shows us the file\nnot only that but it shows us the file that it comes from and then the line\nthat it comes from and then the line\nthat it comes from and then the line number where the style is and if I click\nnumber where the style is and if I click\nnumber where the style is and if I click on this it'll open that up it'll show us\non this it'll open that up it'll show us\non this it'll open that up it'll show us bootstrap CSS with that style and then\nbootstrap CSS with that style and then\nbootstrap CSS with that style and then we can just close that up and go back to\nwe can just close that up and go back to\nwe can just close that up and go back to elements and we have a checkbox next to\nelements and we have a checkbox next to\nelements and we have a checkbox next to these Styles here so this padding top if\nthese Styles here so this padding top if\nthese Styles here so this padding top if I uncheck that it's gonna go ahead and\nI uncheck that it's gonna go ahead and\nI uncheck that it's gonna go ahead and remove that class from that or it's\nremove that class from that or it's\nremove that class from that or it's gonna toggle it that style from that\ngonna toggle it that style from that\ngonna toggle it that style from that element\nelement\nelement okay oh no not only from that element\nokay oh no not only from that element\nokay oh no not only from that element but anything that has the PT v class\nbut anything that has the PT v class\nbut anything

we want we can select this let's click inspect and\ncan select this let's click inspect and\ncan select this let's click inspect and click the button and then we'll go over\nclick the button and then we'll go over\nclick the button and then we'll go over here and we'll right-click and let's\nhere and we'll right-click and let's\nhere and we'll right-click and let's let's check off hover and then it'll\nlet's check off hover and then it'll\nlet's check off hover and then it'll display that as the hover State okay and\ndisplay that as the hover State okay and\ndisplay that as the hover State okay and you can see it adds a little dot here to\nyou can see it adds a little dot here to\nyou can see it adds a little dot here to tell you that it's in the hover State\ntell you that it's in the hover State\ntell you that it's in the hover State and it's not just hover we can also do\nand it's not just hover we can also do\nand it's not just hover we can also do active and focused and what else visited\nactive and focused and what else visited\nactive and focused and what else visited so you can change the states like that\nso you can change the states like that\nso you can change the states like that alright and then as far as this menu see\nalright and then as far as this menu see\nalright and then as far as this menu see we covered pretty much everything\nwe covered pretty much everything\nwe covered pretty much everything and all if we want to expand everything\nand all if we want to expand everything\nand all if we want to expand everything that's in the tree here and we can\nthat's in the tree here and we can\nthat's in the tree here and we can collapse all all right\ncollapse all all right\ncollapse all all right so now let's move on to messing with\nso now let's move on to messing with\nso now let's move on to messing with styles so I'm going to just pull this up\nstyles so I'm going to just pull this up\nstyles so I'm going to just pull this up so we can see the CSS now let's go to\nso we can see the CSS now let's go to\nso we can see the CSS now let's go to the navbar so this right here and as I\nthe navbar so this right here and as I\nthe navbar so this right here and as I showed you we can we can change things\nshowed you we can we can change things\nshowed you we can we can change things like in the class here bootstrap 4 has a\nlike in the class here bootstrap 4 has a\nlike in the class here bootstrap 4 has a class of navbar light what that does is\nclass of navbar light what that does is\nclass of navbar light what that does is it makes the text dark I know that\nit makes the text dark I know that\nit makes the text dark I know that sounds a little weird but it's basically\nsounds a little weird but it's basically\nsounds a little weird but it's basically saying the navbar has a light background\nsaying the navbar has a light background\nsaying the navbar has a light background so the text should be dark so what I'm\nso the text should be dark so what I'm\nso the text should be dark so what I'm gonna do is change this to navbar dark\ngonna do is change this to navbar dark\ngonna do is change this to navbar dark enter and now you'll see that the text\nenter and now you'll see that the text\nenter and now you'll see that the text is now gone it's not gone but it's white\nis now gone it's not gone but it's white\nis now gone it's not gone but it's white because it thinks the navbar has a dark\nbecause it thinks the navbar has a dark\nbecause it thinks the navbar has a dark background so that's one way we can\nbackground so that's one way we can\nbackground so that's one way we can change and add classes another way is we\nchange and add classes another way is we\nchange and add classes another way is we can go down here make sure you have the\ncan go down here make sure you have the\ncan go down here make sure you have the element selected and we can go to this\nelement selected and we can go to this\nelement selected and we can go to this dot CLS and we can add a new class here\ndot CLS and we can add a new class here\ndot CLS and we can add a new class here we can also as I showed you before we\nwe can also as I showed you before we\nwe can also as I showed you before we can toggle so for example we can toggle\ncan toggle so for example we can toggle\ncan toggle so for example we can toggle that navbar dark class but let's go\nthat navbar dark class but let's go\nthat navbar dark class but let's go ahead and add a different background\nahead and add a different background\nahead and add a different background color to this so bootstrap has a class\ncolor to this so bootstrap has a class\ncolor to this so bootstrap has a class called BG info which will give it a blue\ncalled BG info which will give it a blue\ncalled BG info which will give it a blue background so go ahead and type and\nbackground so go ahead and type and\nbackground so go ahead and type and notice as I start typing it'll pull up\nnotice as I start typing it'll pull up\nnotice as I start typing it'll pull up all the classes that are in the\nall the classes that are in the\nall the classes that are in the bootstrap CSS file so any CSS file you\nbootstrap CSS file so any CSS file you\nbootstrap CSS file so any CSS file you have connected it'll automatically kind\nhave connected it'll automatically kind\nhave connected it'll automatically kind of search the classes so let's use BG -\nof search the classes so let's use BG -\nof search the classes so let's use BG - info it enter and it'll add that as a\ninfo it enter and it'll add that as a\ninfo it enter and it'll add that as a class ok so notice that the background\nclass ok so notice that the background\nclass ok so notice that the background of the navbar is now blue now another\nof the navbar is now blue now another\nof the navbar is now blue now another thing if we go down to the CSS here we\nthing if we go down to the CSS here we\nthing if we go down to the CSS here we can change things like let's BG info\ncan change things like let's BG info\ncan change things like let's BG info right here so that we have this color it\nright here so that we have this color it\nright here so that we have this color it shows us the color and if we click on it\nshows us the color and if we click on it\nshows us the color and if we click on it we have a nice little color picker and\nwe have a nice little color picker and\nwe have a nice little color picker and we can change the color that way as well\nwe can change the color that way as well\nwe can change the color that way as well as well so if we wanted to change it to\nas well so if we wanted to change it to\nas well so if we wanted to change it to like I don't know - like a reddish color\nlike I don't know - like a reddish color\nlike I don't know - like a reddish color like that we could go ahead and do that\nlike that we could go ahead and do that\nlike that we could go ahead and do that if we wanted to change up here the\nif we wanted to change up here the\nif we wanted to change up here the navbar class has a box shadow\nnavbar class has a box shadow\nnavbar class has a box shadow we could go ahead and change that color\nwe could go ahead and change that color\nwe could go ahead and change that color so if we wanted to make that like a red\nso if we wanted to make that like a red\nso if we wanted to make that like a red and we also have an eyedropper tool\nand we also have an eyedropper tool\nand we also have an eyedropper tool which if we click that we can just pick\nwhich if we click that we can just pick\nwhich if we click that we can just pick colors in here okay we'll choose that\ncolors in here okay we'll choose that\ncolors in here okay we'll choose that black color I guess and then to change\nblack color I guess and then to change\nblack color I guess and then to change numeric values we can actually let's see\nnumeric values we can actually let's see\nnumeric values we can actually let's see go like that and I can just go ahead and\ngo like that and I can just go ahead and\ngo like that and I can just go ahead and click the up arrow up or down arrow and\nclick the up arrow up or down arrow and\nclick the up arrow up or down arrow and that'll change that value okay it'll\nthat'll change that value okay it'll\nthat'll change that value okay it'll increment or deep or deep decrement it\nincrement or deep or deep decrement it\nincrement or deep or deep decrement it alright so we can do stuff like that\nalright so we can do stuff like that\nalright so we can do stuff like that which is really cool we could do it with\nwhich is really cool we could do it with\nwhich is really cool we could do it with the opacity as well see for the colors I\nthe opacity as well see for the colors I\nthe opacity as well see for the colors I never tried that but does that do\nnever tried that but does that do\nnever tried that but does that do anything no I didn't know if it would\nanything no I didn't know if it would\nanything no I didn't know if it would increment the hexadecimal in some way\nincrement the hexadecimal in some way\nincrement the hexadecimal in some way but I guess not all right so let's see\nbut I guess not all right so let's see\nbut I guess not all right so let's see what else we can also add new styles\nwhat else we can also add new styles\nwhat else we can also add new styles okay with this this plus button right\nokay with this this plus button right\nokay with

body has an idea of home so\nbody the body has an idea of home so it'll create a style for exactly what\nit'll create a style for exactly what\nit'll create a style for exactly what this is okay so if I click this new\nthis is okay so if I click this new\nthis is okay so if I click this new style rule it'll create a style for body\nstyle rule it'll create a style for body\nstyle rule it'll create a style for body home and we could say like background\nhome and we could say like background\nhome and we could say like background let's say background black and that'll\nlet's say background black and that'll\nlet's say background black and that'll automatically change to black alright I\nautomatically change to black alright I\nautomatically change to black alright I know this looks horrendous but I'm just\nknow this looks horrendous but I'm just\nknow this looks horrendous but I'm just trying to give you some examples of how\ntrying to give you some examples of how\ntrying to give you some examples of how this stuff works all right now let's\nthis stuff works all right now let's\nthis stuff works all right now let's choose the showcase let's see so\nchoose the showcase let's see so\nchoose the showcase let's see so showcase right here section showcase and\nshowcase right here section showcase and\nshowcase right here section showcase and then I'm gonna click on computed and\nthen I'm gonna click on computed and\nthen I'm gonna click on computed and this shows us the box model so it gives\nthis shows us the box model so it gives\nthis shows us the box model so it gives us the width and the height of the\nus the width and the height of the\nus the width and the height of the element gives us the padding the border\nelement gives us the padding the

if we\nhas all right in addition to that if we\nhas all right in addition to that if we go down here it gives us all the\ngo down here it gives us all the\ngo down here it gives us all the specific styles for this element okay so\nspecific styles for this element okay so\nspecific styles for this element okay so for instance background image if I go\nfor instance background image if I go\nfor

our head tag and then we have an h1 in\nour head tag and then we have an h1 in\nour head tag and then we have an h1 in the body so over here on the console\nthe body so over here on the console\nthe body so over here on the console make sure you have the console tab\nmake sure you have the console tab\nmake sure you have the console tab highlighted you can actually run\nhighlighted you can

that\nalerts one and enter you'll see that\nalerts one and enter you'll see that it'll execute that JavaScript JavaScript\nit'll execute that JavaScript JavaScript\nit'll execute that JavaScript JavaScript now when it gives us undefined back that\nnow when it gives us undefined back that\nnow when it gives us undefined back that just means that there's no return value\njust means that there's

as well\nyou throughout the course as well throughout this section one is going to\nthroughout this section one is going to\nthroughout this section one is going to be money sign underscore what that'll do\nbe money sign underscore what that'll do\nbe money sign underscore what that'll do if I click enter it'll give us the last\nif I click enter it'll give us the last\nif I click enter it'll give us the last returned value from the last expression\nreturned value from the last expression\nreturned value from the last expression all right now this button here will\nall right now this button here will\nall right now this button here will clear the console and now if I do the\nclear the console and now if I do the\nclear the console and now if I do the money sign underscore it's gonna give us\nmoney sign underscore it's gonna give us\nmoney sign underscore it's gonna give us undefined because it cleared everything\nundefined because it cleared everything\nundefined because it cleared everything out\nout\nout okay another symbol we have is money\nokay another symbol we have is money\nokay another symbol we have is money sign 0 1 2 and so on and what that does\nsign 0 1 2 and so on and what that does\nsign 0 1 2 and so on and what that does is it'll show us the last element\nis it'll show us the last element\nis it'll show us the last element selected with the inspector all right so\nselected with the inspector all right so\nselected with the inspector all right so right now if I save money sign 0 gives\nright now if I save money sign 0 gives\nright now if I save money sign 0 gives us undefined let's go ahead and click\nus undefined let's go ahead and click\nus undefined let's go ahead and click inspect and let's inspect this h1 right\ninspect and let's

it and then we'll go back\njust click on it and then we'll go back\njust click on it and then we'll go back to the console and let's say money sign\nto the console and let's say money sign\nto the console and let's say money sign 0 and you'll see that it'll give us the\n0 and you'll see that it'll give us the\n0 and you'll see that it'll give us the h1 all right if we select something else\nh1 all right if we select something else\nh1 all right if we select something else like the HTML you can see right here\nlike the HTML you can see right here\nlike the HTML you can see right here it's telling us we're just selecting the\nit's telling us we're just selecting the\nit's telling us we're just selecting the HTML element we'll go back to console\nHTML element we'll go back to

get\nright now if we do money sign 1 we get\nright now if we do money sign 1 we get the dev tools because that was the one\nthe dev tools because that was the one\nthe dev tools because that was the one we selected before that if we do when he\nwe selected before that if we do when he\nwe selected before that if we do when he signed to will get undefined because we\nsigned to will get undefined because we\nsigned to will get undefined because we did not select anything before that the\ndid not select anything before that the\ndid not select anything before that the h1 was the first thing that we selected\nh1 was the first thing that we selected\nh1 was the first thing that we selected all right now you can also use the money\nall right now you can also use the money\nall right now you can also use the money sign as an alias for document dot query\nsign as an alias for document dot query\nsign as an alias for document dot query selector so it works just like jQuery\nselector so it works just like jQuery\nselector so it works just like jQuery although it's not jQuery so what I'm\nalthough it's not jQuery so what I'm\nalthough it's not jQuery so what I'm gonna do is just cancel this out or\ngonna do is just cancel this out or\ngonna do is just cancel this out or clear this and let's say document dot\nclear this and let's say document dot\nclear this and let's say document dot not get we want document dot query\nnot get we want document dot query\nnot get we want document dot query selector whoops didn't mean to do that\nselector whoops didn't mean to do that\nselector whoops didn't mean to do that query selector and we want to grab the\nquery selector and we want to grab the\nquery selector and we want to grab the h1 and let's say dot style dot color\nh1 and let's say dot style dot color\nh1 and let's say dot style dot color equals red and then enter and that'll\nequals red and then enter and that'll\nequals red and then enter and that'll actually change it to red now document\nactually change it to red now document\nactually change it to red now document dot query selector is just vanilla\ndot query selector is just vanilla\ndot query selector is just vanilla JavaScript now we can use the money sign\nJavaScript now we can use the money sign\nJavaScript now we can use the money sign as an alias for a query selector so we\nas an alias for a query selector so we\nas an alias for a query selector so we can essentially use jQuery it's not\ncan essentially use jQuery it's not\ncan essentially use jQuery it's not jQuery but it's the same format so we\njQuery but it's the same format so we\njQuery but it's the same format so we can say h1 we can say dot style dot\ncan say h1 we can say dot style dot\ncan say h1 we can say dot style dot color equals blue and that'll change it\ncolor equals blue and that'll change it\ncolor equals blue and that'll change it to blue okay now if I reload this it's\nto blue okay now if I reload this it's\nto blue okay now if I reload this it's gonna of course go back to normal\ngonna of course go back to normal\ngonna of course go back to normal another thing I want to show you is that\nanother thing I want to show you is that\nanother thing I want to show you is that you can open the console from any tab if\nyou can open the console from any tab if\nyou can open the console from any tab if we're in elements and you want the\nwe're in elements and you want the\nwe're in elements and you want the console open you can do a control what\nconsole open you can do a control what\nconsole open you can do a control what is a control shift J no I'm sorry\nis a control shift J no I'm sorry\nis a control shift J no I'm sorry control shift J we'll just open the\ncontrol shift J we'll just open the\ncontrol shift J we'll just open the console up from from nothing to open up\nconsole up from from nothing to open up\nconsole up from from nothing to open up the console drawer then you want to do\nthe console drawer then you want to do\nthe console drawer then you want to do what the hell is it it's so just escape\nwhat the hell is it it's so just escape\nwhat the hell is it it's so just escape if I click escape you'll see that this\nif I click escape you'll see that this\nif I click escape you'll see that this opens we get this what's new I'm gonna\nopens we get this what's new I'm gonna\nopens we get this what's new I'm gonna close that out and then we have the\nclose that out and then we have the\nclose that out and then we have the console down here okay in addition to\nconsole down here okay in addition to\nconsole down here okay in addition to the elements tab but I'm just gonna go\nthe elements tab but I'm just gonna go\nthe elements tab but I'm just gonna go right back to the console alright and\nright back to the console alright and\nright back to the console alright and we'll get this rid of that all right so\nwe'll get this rid of that all right so\nwe'll get this rid of that all right so now let's move over to the file and\nnow let's move over to the file and\nnow let's move over to the file and let's see some things we can do over\nlet's see some things we can do over\nlet's see some things we can do over here so what I'm gonna do is add some\nhere so what I'm gonna do is add some\nhere so what I'm gonna do is add some script tags and if you guys have watched\nscript tags and if you guys have watched\nscript tags and if you guys have watched any of my videos at all I do a lot of\nany of my videos at all I do a lot of\nany of my videos at all I do a lot of JavaScript and you'll see me lots of\nJavaScript and you'll see me lots of\nJavaScript and you'll see me lots of times use console.log that's how we can\ntimes use console.log that's how we can\ntimes use console.log that's how we can do testing that's how we just if we want\ndo testing that's how we just if we want\ndo testing that's how we just if we want any output from our application we use\nany output from our application we use\nany output from our application we use console.log now in my case this is gonna\nconsole.log now in my case this is gonna\nconsole.log now in my case this is gonna be cuz I'm using a plug-in here called\nbe cuz I'm using a plug-in here called\nbe cuz I'm using a plug-in here called live server for visual studio code so if\nlive server for visual studio code so if\nlive server for visual studio code so if you're not using that you will have ten\nyou're not using that you will have ten\nyou're not using that you will have ten you're following along you will have to\nyou're following along you will have to\nyou're following along you will have to reload so that's just logging something\nreload so that's just logging something\nreload so that's just logging something to the console all right now the console\nto the console all right now the console\nto the console all right now the console also gives us errors okay any errors so\nalso gives us errors okay any errors so\nalso gives us errors okay any errors so if we for instance a console dot log and\nif we for instance a console dot log and\nif we for instance a console dot log and we try to pass in a variable called my\nwe try to pass in a variable called my\nwe try to pass in a variable called my var that is not declared and we go ahead\nvar that is not declared and we go ahead\nvar that is not declared and we go ahead and run it we're gonna get this uncaught\nand run it we're gonna get this uncaught\nand run it we're gonna get this uncaught reference error my var is not defined\nreference error my var is not defined\nreference error my var is not defined okay in addition to that it's going to\nokay in addition to that it's going to\nokay in addition to that it's going to give us the file name it's going to give\ngive us the file name it's going to give\ngive us the file name it's going to give us the line number that through the\nus the line number that through the\nus the line number that through the errors so if I go ahead and click that\nerrors so if I go ahead and click that\nerrors so if I go ahead and click that it'll open up you know that part of\nit'll open up you know that part of\nit'll open up you know that part of file and it'll show us what caused that\nfile and it'll show us what caused that\nfile and it'll show us what caused that error alright so let's go back to\nerror alright so let's go back to\nerror alright so let's go back to console and I'm just gonna comment this\nconsole and I'm just gonna comment this\nconsole and I'm just gonna comment this out now we can also throw our own errors\nout now we can also throw our own errors\nout now we can also throw our own errors in our scripts so if we say console dot\nin our scripts so if we say console dot\nin our scripts so if we say console dot error and we can say this is an error\nerror and we can say this is an error\nerror and we can say this is an error and save and you'll see it'll run and it\nand save and you'll see it'll run and it\nand save and you'll see it'll run and it looks just like an error it'll also show\nlooks just like an error it'll also show\nlooks just like an error it'll also show us the line that caused it all right\nus the line that caused it all right\nus the line that caused it all right in addition to errors we can do warnings\nin addition to errors we can do warnings\nin addition to errors we can do warnings so console dot warned will say this is a\nso console dot warned will say this is a\nso console dot warned will say this is a warning and save and it basically does\nwarning and save and it basically does\nwarning and save and it basically does the same thing except it's yellow has a\nthe same thing except it's yellow has a\nthe same thing except it's yellow has a little exclamation mark instead of an X\nlittle exclamation mark instead of an X\nlittle exclamation mark instead of an X all right so let's take a look at some\nall right so let's take a look at some\nall right so let's take a look at some other console commands we have the\nother console commands we have the\nother console commands we have the console dot dir command and that's\nconsole dot dir command and that's\nconsole dot dir command and that's basically gonna show us a Java Script\nbasically gonna show us a Java Script\nbasically gonna show us a Java Script representation of any Dom element so\nrepresentation of any Dom element so\nrepresentation of any Dom element so let's put in the actual document here\nlet's put in the actual document here\nlet's put in the actual document here and save and then we'll get this this\nand save and then we'll get this this\nand save and then we'll get this this hash document but if we click on this\nhash document but if we click on this\nhash document but if we click on this arrow it'll show us everything about the\narrow it'll show us everything about the\narrow it'll show us everything about the document okay and we can access any of\ndocument okay and we can access any of\ndocument okay and we can access any of this for instance if we wanted the URL\nthis for instance if we wanted the URL\nthis for instance if we wanted the URL we could say console.log and we could\nwe could say console.log and we could\nwe could say console.log and we could say document dot URL let's actually\nsay document dot URL let's actually\nsay document dot URL let's actually comment this out and save and reload we\ncomment this out and save and reload we\ncomment this out and save and reload we don't have to reload but it'll show us\ndon't have to reload but it'll show us\ndon't have to reload but it'll show us the URL so we can get any any value from\nthe URL so we can get any any value from\nthe URL so we can get any any value from that from that document object and if\nthat from that document object and if\nthat from that document object and if you're interested in more if you're\nyou're interested in more if you're\nyou're interested in more if you're interested in more of this kind of stuff\ninterested in more of this kind of stuff\ninterested in more of this kind of stuff looking at the document looking at the\nlooking at the document looking at the\nlooking at the document looking at the Dom check out my Dom crash course it's a\nDom check out my Dom crash course it's a\nDom check out my Dom crash course it's a 4 4 video course on YouTube absolutely\n4 4 video course on YouTube absolutely\n4 4 video course on YouTube absolutely free and you might want to check that\nfree and you might want to check that\nfree and you might want to check that out\nout\nout alright so another thing we can do is we\nalright so another thing we can do is we\nalright so another thing we can do is we can create tables in the console of with\ncan create tables in the console of with\ncan create tables in the console of with arrays so for instance let's say console\narrays so for instance let's say console\narrays so for instance let's say console table and we're gonna put in some\ntable and we're gonna put in some\ntable and we're gonna put in some brackets and let's add an object we'll\nbrackets and let's add an object we'll\nbrackets and let's add an object we'll put a name of John email\nlet's say test test comm and we'll put\nlet's say test test comm and we'll put an age of 33 all right so let's save\nan age of 33 all right so let's save\nan age of 33 all right so let's save that and you can see it actually creates\nthat and you can see it actually creates\nthat and you can see it actually creates a table okay so we can add more objects\na table okay so we can add more objects\na table okay so we can add more objects to this array and it would add it to the\nto this array and it would add it to the\nto this array and it would add it to the table all right another thing I wanted\ntable all right another thing I wanted\ntable all right another thing I wanted to show you is that we can filter some\nto show you is that we can filter some\nto show you is that we can filter some of the stuff out if we want so you'll\nof the stuff out if we want so you'll\nof the stuff out if we want so you'll see we have info warnings and errors\nsee we have info warnings and errors\nsee we have info warnings and errors checked off now the table is considered\nchecked off now the table is considered\nchecked off now the table is considered info so if I go ahead and I click that\ninfo so if I go ahead and I click that\ninfo so if I go ahead and I click that it'll hide it if we want to not show\nit'll hide it if we want to not show\nit'll hide it if we want to not show warnings it'll hide the warning if and\nwarnings it'll hide the warning if and\nwarnings it'll hide the warning if and you'll see now it says errors only if I\nyou'll see now it says errors only if I\nyou'll see now it says errors only if I uncheck errors it won't show that at all\nuncheck errors it won't show that at all\nuncheck errors it won't show that at all it says hide all so we can filter the\nit says hide all so we can filter the\nit says hide all so we can filter the type of logs that are gonna show down\ntype of logs that are gonna show down\ntype of logs that are gonna show down here and the types of errors and\nhere and the types of errors and\nhere and the types of errors and warnings and stuff all right so another\nwarnings and stuff all right so another\nwarnings and stuff all right so another command we have is console dot clear and\ncommand we have is console dot clear and\ncommand we have is console dot clear and I'm sure you can guess what that does it\nI'm sure you can guess what that does it\nI'm sure you can guess what that does it just clears the console for us all right\njust clears the console for us all right\njust clears the console for us all right so let's go ahead and comment this stuff\nso let's go ahead and comment this stuff\nso let's go ahead and comment this stuff out by the way to do that and I do\nout by the way to do that and I do\nout by the way to do that and I do control forward slash and then I want to\ncontrol forward slash and then I want to\ncontrol forward slash and then I want to show you that we can actually log stuff\nshow you that we can actually log stuff\nshow you that we can actually log stuff in groups so if we stay console dot\nin groups so if we stay console dot\nin groups so if we stay console dot group and we give this a name let's just\ngroup and we give this a name let's just\ngroup and we give this a name let's just call this say hello and then down at the\ncall this say hello and then down at the\ncall this say hello and then down at the bottom here we want to say console dot\nbottom here we want to say console dot\nbottom here we want to say console dot group end and here we'll say say hello\ngroup end and here we'll say say hello\ngroup end and here we'll say say hello same thing it's kind of an identifier\nsame thing it's kind of an identifier\nsame thing it's kind of an identifier and then here let's just do console log\nand then here let's just do console log\nand then here let's just do console log I will say hello John copy that paste in\nI will say hello John copy that paste in\nI will say hello John copy that paste in two more will say hello Sally and hello\ntwo more will say hello Sally and hello\ntwo more will say hello Sally and hello I don't know Chris let's save it and run\nI don't know Chris let's save it and run\nI don't know Chris let's save it and run it and you'll see that now all of these\nit and you'll see that now all of these\nit and you'll see that now all of these logs are put into a group this say hello\nlogs are put into a group this say hello\nlogs are put into a group this say hello group which we can actually collapse and\ngroup which we can actually collapse and\ngroup which we can actually collapse and uncollapse alright so we can do that\nuncollapse alright so we can do that\nuncollapse alright so we can do that another thing we can do is we can do a\nanother thing we can do is we can do a\nanother thing we can do is we can do a console time so let's go ahead and say\nconsole time so let's go ahead and say\nconsole time so let's go ahead and say console dot\nconsole dot\nconsole dot I'm give this identifier we'll just\nI'm give this identifier we'll just\nI'm give this identifier we'll just we'll call it for loop and then down\nwe'll call it for loop and then down\nwe'll call it for loop and then down here we'll say console dot time end and\nhere we'll say console dot time end and\nhere we'll say console dot time end and also pass in for loop and this can be\nalso pass in for loop and this can be\nalso pass in for loop and this can be anything the for loop that's just what\nanything the for loop that's just what\nanything the for loop that's just what I'm calling it because that's what I'm\nI'm calling it because that's what I'm\nI'm calling it because that's what I'm gonna do and then I'm just gonna do a\ngonna do and then I'm just gonna do a\ngonna do and then I'm just gonna do a simple for loop here so we'll save our I\nsimple for loop here so we'll save our I\nsimple for loop here so we'll save our I equals 0 as long as I is less than let's\nequals 0 as long as I is less than let's\nequals 0 as long as I is less than let's say 2000 and then we'll do I plus plus\nsay 2000 and then we'll do I plus plus\nsay 2000 and then we'll do I plus plus and then let's just go ahead and console\nand then let's just go ahead and console\nand then let's just go ahead and console dot log I and let's save and now it'll\ndot log I and let's save and now it'll\ndot log I and let's save and now it'll actually run the loop it'll count\nactually run the loop it'll count\nactually run the loop it'll count through 0 to 2000 or 1999 and then it'll\nthrough 0 to 2000 or 1999 and then it'll\nthrough 0 to 2000 or 1999 and then it'll tell us the the identifier and then how\ntell us the the identifier and then how\ntell us the the identifier and then how long it took to do that so it took it a\nlong it took to do that so it took it a\nlong it took to do that so it took it a hundred and eight point this\nhundred and eight point this\nhundred and eight point this milliseconds alright so that is console\nmilliseconds alright so that is console\nmilliseconds alright so that is console dot time we can also run assertions\ndot time we can also run assertions\ndot time we can also run assertions which are basically kind of like tests\nwhich are basically kind of like tests\nwhich are basically kind of like tests so let's create a function here we'll\nso let's create a function here we'll\nso let's create a function here we'll call it greater than and it's gonna take\ncall it greater than and it's gonna take\ncall it greater than and it's gonna take in two values let's say x and y and\nin two values let's say x and y and\nin two values let's say x and y and we're gonna say in here console dot\nwe're gonna say in here console dot\nwe're gonna say in here console dot assert so console assert and then the\nassert so console assert and then the\nassert so console assert and then the condition which is going to be is X\ncondition which is going to be is X\ncondition which is going to be is X greater than Y and then it'll take a\ngreater than Y and then it'll take a\ngreater than Y and then it'll take a second parameter of an object and we're\nsecond parameter of an object and we're\nsecond parameter of an object and we're gonna put a message in here actually\ngonna put a message in here actually\ngonna put a message in here actually this needs to be Jason so we're gonna\nthis needs to be Jason so we're gonna\nthis needs to be Jason so we're gonna wrap this in double quotes and say\nwrap this in double quotes and say\nwrap this in double quotes and say message and we'll say C X is not greater\nmessage and we'll say C X is not greater\nmessage and we'll say C X is not greater than Y alright and then we can pass in\nthan Y alright and then we can pass in\nthan Y alright and then we can pass in the third parameter here and we're gonna\nthe third parameter here and we're gonna\nthe third parameter here and we're gonna say that X is whatever is in the X\nsay that X is whatever is in the X\nsay that X is whatever is in the X variable whatever's passed in and we'll\nvariable whatever's passed in and we'll\nvariable whatever's passed in and we'll put a comma and we'll say Y is\nput a comma and we'll say Y is\nput a comma and we'll say Y is whatever's in the Y and that will\nwhatever's in the Y and that will\nwhatever's in the Y and that will display in the actual message alright so\ndisplay in the actual message alright so\ndisplay in the actual message alright so then we just want to\nthen we just want to\nthen we just want to this will say greater than and let's\nthis will say greater than and let's\nthis will say greater than and let's let's make sure that the first one is\nlet's make sure that the first one is\nlet's make sure that the first one is not greater than the second one so we'll\nnot greater than the second one so we'll\nnot greater than the second one so we'll do four or five oops and that'll make it\ndo four or five oops and that'll make it\ndo four or five oops and that'll make it fail and we'll save and you'll say we\nfail and we'll save and you'll say we\nfail and we'll save and you'll say we get assertion failed message X is not\nget assertion failed message X is not\nget assertion failed message X is not greater than Y and then it shows us the\ngreater than Y and then it shows us the\ngreater than Y and then it shows us the actual values of x and y so we can run\nactual values of x and y so we can run\nactual values of x and y so we can run little assertions and tests with our\nlittle assertions and tests with our\nlittle assertions and tests with our console all right and if I were to put\nconsole all right and if I were to put\nconsole all right and if I were to put something that was greater than like put\nsomething that was greater than like put\nsomething that was greater than like put six then nothing's gonna happen okay\nsix then nothing's gonna happen okay\nsix then nothing's gonna happen okay it's not gonna say passed or anything\nit's not gonna say passed or anything\nit's not gonna say passed or anything like that it's just nothing will happen\nlike that it's just nothing will happen\nlike that it's just nothing will happen all right so I think that that's good\nall right so I think that that's good\nall right so I think that that's good enough I don't want to go too deep into\nenough I don't want to go too deep into\nenough I don't want to go too deep into this console stuff here now you do have\nthis console stuff here now you do have\nthis console stuff here now you do have some settings here you can choose to\nsome settings here you can choose to\nsome settings here you can choose to show timestamps with your logs you can\nshow timestamps with your logs you can\nshow timestamps with your logs you can choose to log any any Ajax requests\nchoose to log any any Ajax

WebSocket and then if I click the\nour WebSocket and then if I click the button all of a sudden we see users this\nbutton all of a sudden we see users this\nbutton all of a sudden we see users this is the the Ajax request if we look at\nis the the Ajax request if we look at\nis the the Ajax request if we look at type it says xhr and if we filter by xhr\ntype it says xhr and if we filter by

at the network time and now we get\nlook at the network time and now we get one point oh eight seconds all right and\none point oh eight seconds all right and\none point oh eight seconds all right and you can see up here that the graph is\nyou can see up here that the graph is\nyou can see up here that the graph is much different it's now up you know in\nmuch different it's now up you know in\nmuch different it's now up you know in between 1000 and 1200 if I bring this\nbetween 1000 and 1200 if I bring this\nbetween 1000 and 1200 if I bring this back down to 2000 and save now we're\nback down to 2000 and save now we're\nback down to 2000 and save now we're down to you know just above 150\ndown to you know just above 150\ndown to you know just above 150 milliseconds okay and the more code you\nmilliseconds okay and the more code you\nmilliseconds okay and the more code you have the more files you have the longer\nhave the more files you have the longer\nhave the more files you have the longer it's gonna add to your load time so\nit's gonna add to your load time so\nit's gonna add to your load time so let's take a look at the bootstrap theme\nlet's take a look at the bootstrap

open up close\nso if we go ahead and we open up close\nso if we go ahead and we open up close that up and we reload the the network\nthat up and we reload the the network\nthat up and we reload the the network you'll see that this took not bad it\nyou'll see that this took not bad it\nyou'll see that this took not bad it took 189 milliseconds to load on content\ntook 189 milliseconds to load on content\ntook 189 milliseconds to load on content loaded took 51 milliseconds so a lot of\nloaded took 51 milliseconds so a lot of\nloaded took 51 milliseconds so a lot of this stuff was added from like images so\nthis stuff was added from like images so\nthis stuff was added from like images so when you have large images that that\nwhen you have large images that that\nwhen you have large

want\nbut I think that's it that's all I want to do for the network tab now we're\nto do for the network tab now we're\nto do for the network tab now we're going to move on to the application tab\ngoing to move on to the application tab\ngoing to move on to the application tab alright so the application tab is what's\nalright so the application tab is what's\nalright so the application tab is what's gonna show us we can we can look at\ngonna show us we can we can look at\ngonna show us we can we can look at what's in our browser storage and\nwhat's in our browser storage and\nwhat's in our browser storage and there's multiple ways to store data\nthere's multiple ways to store data\nthere's multiple ways to store data inside of a browser okay so we have\ninside of a browser okay so we have\ninside of a browser okay so we have local storage\nlocal storage\nlocal storage now I've cleared everything out you can\nnow I've cleared everything out you can\nnow I've cleared everything out you can actually completely clear everything\nactually completely clear everything\nactually completely clear everything from this tab here you can clear your\nfrom this tab here you can clear your\nfrom this tab here you can clear your site data but we can look at local\nsite data but we can look at local\nsite data but we can look at local storage session storage index TV and web\nstorage session storage index TV and web\nstorage session storage index TV and web SQL are basically like client-side in\nSQL are basically like client-side in\nSQL are basically like client-side in browser databases\nbrowser databases\nbrowser databases and then we have our cookies we also\nand then we have our cookies we also\nand then we have our cookies we also have cash storage application cash so\nhave cash storage application cash so\nhave cash storage application cash so what I'm gonna do is we're gonna go over\nwhat I'm gonna do is we're gonna go over\nwhat I'm gonna do is we're gonna go over to our file here into our script tags\nto our file here into our script tags\nto our file here into our script tags and gonna add a local storage value okay\nand gonna add a local storage value okay\nand gonna add a local storage value okay through JavaScript and html5 so to do\nthrough JavaScript and html5 so to do\nthrough JavaScript and html5 so to do that we can say local storage and to set\nthat we can say local storage and to set\nthat we can say local storage and to set an item we can say set item and let's go\nan item we can say set item and let's go\nan item we can say set item and let's go ahead and set let's say name and we're\nahead and set let's say name and we're\nahead and set let's say name and we're gonna set that to John and save and now\ngonna set that to John and save and now\ngonna set that to John and save and now if we reload our application and we look\nif we reload our application and we look\nif we reload our application and we look under local storage and we click on our\nunder local storage and we click on our\nunder local storage and we click on our local host you'll see that now we have a\nlocal host you'll see that now we have a\nlocal host you'll see that now we have a key of name and a value of John alright\nkey of name and a value of John alright\nkey of name and a value of John alright and we can get this from our JavaScript\nand we can get this from our JavaScript\nand we can get this from our JavaScript really easily too by just saying local\nreally easily too by just saying local\nreally easily too by just saying local storage dot get item and we want to get\nstorage dot get item and we want to get\nstorage dot get item and we want to get name so what we'll do is we'll just\nname so what we'll do is we'll just\nname so what we'll do is we'll just console.log that and save and if we open\nconsole.log that and save and if we open\nconsole.log that and save and if we open up our console over here down at the\nup our console over here down at the\nup our console over here down at the bottom you'll see we get John alright\nbottom you'll see we get John alright\nbottom you'll see we get John alright now the difference between local storage\nnow the difference between local storage\nnow the difference between local storage and session storage is that local\nand session storage is that local\nand session storage is that local storage will stay on in your browser\nstorage will stay on in your browser\nstorage will stay on in your browser it'll stay on your machine until it's\nit'll stay on your machine until it's\nit'll stay on your machine until it's cleared okay and I can clear it from the\ncleared okay and I can clear it from the\ncleared okay and I can clear it from the JavaScript or you can clear it from here\nJavaScript or you can clear it from here\nJavaScript or you can clear it from here so to clear it from JavaScript we can\nso to clear it from JavaScript we can\nso to clear it from JavaScript we can say whoops we could say local storage\nsay whoops we could say local storage\nsay whoops we could say local storage dot and then we can say clear and we'll\ndot and then we can say clear and we'll\ndot and then we can say clear and we'll pass in here name alright so now if I\npass in here name alright so now if I\npass in here name alright so now if I save that reload you'll see that it\nsave that reload you'll see that it\nsave that reload you'll see that it disappeared it was set but then it was\ndisappeared it was set but then it was\ndisappeared it was set but then it was cleared so we can do it that way if I go\ncleared so we can do it that way if I go\ncleared so we can do it that way if I go ahead and I comment this out and run it\nahead and I comment this out and run it\nahead and I comment this out and run it then it gets set again but we can go\nthen it gets set again but we can go\nthen it gets set again but we can go over here and we can refresh if we want\nover here and we can refresh if we want\nover here and we can refresh if we want and we can also get rid of it all right\nand we can also get rid of it all right\nand we can also get rid of it all right so local storage will stay until that\nso local storage will stay until that\nso local storage will stay until that happens now session Storage has the same\nhappens now session Storage has the same\nhappens now session Storage has the same API the same syntax really except that\nAPI the same syntax really except that\nAPI the same syntax really except that it goes away when your browsers closed\nit goes away when your browsers closed\nit goes away when your browsers closed or when your session ends so what I'll\nor when your session ends so what I'll\nor when your session ends so what I'll do here is I'll say session\ndo here is I'll say session\ndo here is I'll say session storage and it has the same method so\nstorage and it has the same method so\nstorage and it has the same method so set item and let's set I don't know\nset item and let's set I don't know\nset item and let's set I don't know we'll set car and we'll set that to\nwe'll set car and we'll set that to\nwe'll set car and we'll set that to let's say BMW and we'll save and John\nlet's say BMW and we'll save and John\nlet's say BMW and we'll save and John got added again because we still have\ngot added again because we still have\ngot added again because we still have this line here but if we look at session\nthis line here but if we look at session\nthis line here but if we look at session corage session storage we now have this\ncorage session storage we now have this\ncorage session storage we now have this car BMW alright and you can clear it out\ncar BMW alright and you can clear it out\ncar BMW alright and you can clear it out and you can you know fetch the session\nand you can you know fetch the session\nand you can you know fetch the session storage the same way it's basically the\nstorage the same way it's basically the\nstorage the same way it's basically the exact same API it's just that it'll go\nexact same API it's just that it'll go\nexact same API it's just that it'll go away when the browser is closed and when\naway when the browser is closed and when\naway when the browser is closed and when the session ends alright now we can also\nthe session ends alright now we can also\nthe session ends alright now we can also track cookies so if we go down here well\ntrack cookies so if we go down here well\ntrack cookies so if we go down here well let's go ahead and create a cookie to do\nlet's go ahead and create a cookie to do\nlet's go ahead and create a cookie to do that we can say document dot cookie and\nthat we can say document dot cookie and\nthat we can say document dot cookie and we'll set that equal to let's say\nwe'll set that equal to let's say\nwe'll set that equal to let's say username username equals John Doe and\nusername username equals John Doe and\nusername username equals John Doe and save and now you can see that a cookies\nsave and now you can see that a cookies\nsave and now you can see that a cookies been added if I just make this a little\nbeen added if I just make this a little\nbeen added if I just make this a little bigger so cookies been added for this\nbigger so cookies been added for this\nbigger so cookies been added for this domain that's the value of it this is\ndomain that's the value of it this is\ndomain that's the value of it this is the name it doesn't have a max it\nthe name it doesn't have a max it\nthe name it doesn't have a max it doesn't expire so it expires when the\ndoesn't expire so it expires when the\ndoesn't expire so it expires when the session ends you can expand ago through\nsession ends you can expand ago through\nsession ends you can expand ago through that I don't want this to be a tutorial\nthat I don't want this to be a tutorial\nthat I don't want this to be a tutorial on cookies I'm just trying to show you\non cookies I'm just trying to show you\non cookies I'm just trying to show you that you can track and you can see your\nthat you can track and you

you can go ahead\nalright and of course you can go ahead\nalright and of course you can go ahead and you can clear these out what you can\nand you can clear these out what you can\nand you can clear these out what you can go one by one like that or you can just\ngo one by one like that or you can just\ngo one by one like that or you can just go to clear storage and select what you\ngo to clear

everything and you'll see that\nclear everything and you'll see that\nclear everything and you'll see that everything is gone alright so that's how\neverything is gone alright so that's how\neverything is gone alright so that's how you can manage your your browser storage\nyou can manage your your browser storage\nyou can manage your your browser storage I'm not gonna go over like indexeddb and\nI'm not gonna go over like indexeddb and\nI'm not gonna go over like indexeddb and web SQL those are different technologies\nweb SQL those are different technologies\nweb SQL those are different technologies that I don't want to get into but just\nthat I don't want to get into but just\nthat I don't want to get into but just know that you can see that stuff from\nknow that you can see that stuff from\nknow that you can see that stuff from here as well alright now I want to take\nhere as well alright now I want to take\nhere as well alright now I want to take a look at the audits tab so this will\na look at the audits tab so this will\na look at the audits tab so this will allow us to perform an audit that will\nallow us to perform an audit that will\nallow us to perform an audit that will basically give us some\nbasically give us some\nbasically give us some readings on our website about the\nreadings on our website about the\nreadings on our website about the performance it'll give us some\nperformance it'll give us some\nperformance it'll give us some suggestions to make it perform better\nsuggestions to make it perform better\nsuggestions to make it perform better things like that\nthings like that\nthings like that now you also need to take into account\nnow you also need to take into account\nnow you also need to take into account the server that you're on so what I've\nthe server that you're on so what I've\nthe server that you're on so what I've done is I've uploaded this mizuki\ndone is I've uploaded this mizuki\ndone is I've uploaded this mizuki template to a domain called code skelet\ntemplate to a domain called code skelet\ntemplate to a domain called code skelet comm which is being hosted at I think\ncomm which is being hosted at I think\ncomm which is being hosted at I think it's Hostgator I thinks it's a it's a\nit's Hostgator I thinks it's a it's a\nit's Hostgator I thinks it's a it's a shared hosting account so that may have\nshared hosting account so that may have\nshared hosting account so that may have an effect on it but let's go ahead and\nan effect on it but let's go ahead and\nan effect on it but let's go ahead and just perform an audit so we're gonna\njust perform an audit so we're gonna\njust perform an audit so we're gonna open up two chrome tools and go to\nopen up two chrome tools and go to\nopen up two chrome tools and go to audits and click perform audit and I'm\naudits and click perform audit and I'm\naudits and click perform audit and I'm gonna choose all of these except for the\ngonna choose all of these except for the\ngonna choose all of these except for the progressive web app and click run on it\nprogressive web app and click run on it\nprogressive web app and click run on it all right and this may take a few\nall right and this may take a few\nall right and this may take a few minutes so I'm gonna go ahead and pause\nminutes so I'm gonna go ahead and pause\nminutes so I'm gonna go ahead and pause the video until this is done alright so\nthe video until this is done alright so\nthe video until this is done alright so we get the results back for this this\nwe get the results back for this this\nwe get the results back for this this website uploaded at code skillet com so\nwebsite uploaded at code skillet com so\nwebsite uploaded at code skillet com so we got 88 per performance performance\nwe got 88 per performance performance\nwe got 88 per performance performance which isn't bad accessibility was 86\nwhich isn't bad accessibility was 86\nwhich isn't bad accessibility was 86 best practices 77 and I can tell you\nbest practices 77 and I can tell you\nbest practices 77 and I can tell you that a lot of this performance and best\nthat a lot of this performance and best\nthat a lot of this performance and best practices is going to come from the\npractices is going to come from the\npractices is going to come from the images because the images were not\nimages because the images were not\nimages because the images were not optimized or compressed or anything like\noptimized or compressed or anything like\noptimized or compressed or anything like that\nthat\nthat so let's go down here this will tell us\nso let's go down here this will tell us\nso let's go down here this will tell us about PageSpeed the first meaningful\nabout PageSpeed the first meaningful\nabout PageSpeed the first meaningful paint was 2.2 seconds or 2000 to 40\npaint was 2.2 seconds or 2000 to 40\npaint was 2.2 seconds or 2000 to 40 milliseconds and what this means is\nmilliseconds and what this means is\nmilliseconds and what this means is first meaningful paint measures when the\nfirst meaningful paint measures when the\nfirst meaningful paint measures when the primary content of a page is visible\nprimary content of a page is visible\nprimary content of a page is visible alright the first interactive was 4.1\nalright the first interactive was 4.1\nalright the first interactive was 4.1 seconds this is the first point at which\nseconds this is the first point at which\nseconds this is the first point at which necessary scripts of the page have\nnecessary scripts of the page have\nnecessary scripts of the page have loaded and the CPU is idle enough to\nloaded and the CPU is idle enough to\nloaded and the CPU is idle enough to handle most user input so this is like\nhandle most user input so this is like\nhandle most user input so this is like when the site is completely ready this\nwhen the site is completely ready this\nwhen the site is completely ready this is when it's basically loaded enough for\nis when it's basically loaded enough for\nis when it's basically loaded enough for the the you know the user to view the\nthe the you know the user to view the\nthe the you know the user to view the whole page which isn't too bad now\nwhole page which isn't too bad now\nwhole page which isn't too bad now opportunities you'll see serve images as\nopportunities you'll see serve images as\nopportunities you'll see serve images as web P so basically this is telling us to\nweb P so basically this is telling us to\nweb P so basically this is telling us to compress our images with lossy or\ncompress our images with lossy or\ncompress our images with lossy or lossless prop properly sized images you\nlossless prop properly sized images you\nlossless prop properly sized images you have optimized images so you can see\nhave optimized images so you can see\nhave optimized images so you can see that this all has to do with

starting off with the elements tag what this\noff with the elements tag what this\noff with the elements tag what this shows this shows you actually the\nshows this shows you actually the\nshows this shows you actually the complete Dom structure of your website\ncomplete Dom structure of your website\ncomplete Dom structure of your website so your website you have coded an HTML\nso your website

this\nahead and just view page source of this\nahead and just view page source of this particular page you're gonna see this is\nparticular page you're gonna see this is\nparticular page you're gonna see this is actually the HTML which the server sends\nactually the HTML which the server sends\nactually the HTML which the server sends right then the browser downloads all\nright then the browser

Dom structure and this is what you see\nDom structure and this is what you see\nDom structure and this is what you see as the final Dom structure right now at\nas the final Dom structure right now at\nas the final Dom structure right now at the moment right so you see you can just\nthe moment right so you see you can just\nthe moment right so you see you can just open these little tags right

the Dom tree\nthings you want to get into the Dom tree\nthings you want to get into the Dom tree and it will straightaway take you to\nand it will straightaway take you to\nand it will straightaway take you to that to that particular item in your\nthat to that particular item in your\nthat to that particular item in your nested tree right so pretty useful if\nnested tree right so pretty useful

click\nhood Mohan just click on this and click\nhood Mohan just click on this and click here and you are on this h1 containing\nhere and you are on this h1 containing\nhere and you are on this h1 containing hello behold Mohan right alternatively\nhello behold Mohan right alternatively\nhello behold Mohan right alternatively what you could do is just right click on\nwhat you could do is just right click on\nwhat you could do is just right click on that particular element and click on\nthat particular element and click on\nthat particular element and click on inspect it still takes you to that\ninspect it still takes you to that\ninspect it still takes you to that particular element right so if you want\nparticular element right so if you want\nparticular element right so if you want to go to the settings right click on it\nto go to the settings right click on it\nto go to the settings right click on it click on inspect and you are directly to\nclick on inspect and you are directly to\nclick on inspect and you are directly to directly take into settings right all\ndirectly take into settings right all\ndirectly take into settings right all right so that's the part of elements so\nright so that's the part of elements so\nright so that's the part of elements so you're gonna see all this HTML data\nyou're gonna see all this HTML data\nyou're gonna see all this HTML data structure in front of you then\nstructure in front of you then\nstructure in front of you then next comes is this right hand side you\nnext comes is this right hand side you\nnext comes is this right hand side you see whatever you select this right and\nsee whatever you select this right and\nsee whatever you select this right and right hand side keeps on changing right\nright hand side keeps on changing right\nright hand side keeps on changing right so what you see basically on the right\nso what you see basically on the right\nso what you see basically on the right is the Styles applied to that particular\nis the Styles applied to that particular\nis the Styles applied to that particular element so see you have a div ID of\nelement so see you have a div ID of\nelement so see you have a div ID of route here and on the right you see this\nroute here and on the right you see this\nroute here and on the right you see this hash route and CSS associated with it\nhash route and CSS associated with it\nhash route and CSS associated with it now you see these checkboxes you can\nnow you see these checkboxes you can\nnow you see these checkboxes you can actually toggle the properties right\nactually toggle the properties right\nactually toggle the properties right here you can change the property values\nhere you can change the property values\nhere you can change the property values to see real time changes right you can\nto see real time changes right you can\nto see real time changes right you can do pretty much all the stuff you can\ndo pretty much all the stuff you can\ndo pretty much all the stuff you can change any property like whatever you\nchange any property like whatever you\nchange any property like whatever you like you can add properties like\nlike you can add properties like\nlike you can add properties like display:none to hide them\ndisplay:none to hide them\ndisplay:none to hide them you can check uncheck properties just\nyou can check uncheck properties just\nyou can check uncheck properties just like I was talking about you can see the\nlike I was talking about you can see the\nlike I was talking about you can see the first this shows you in the order of\nfirst this shows you in the order of\nfirst this shows you in the order of your styles right so you see this hash\nyour styles right so you see this hash\nyour styles right so you see this hash route this style is defined in this\nroute this style is defined in this\nroute this style is defined in this bundle underscore home dot CSS file if\nbundle underscore home dot CSS file if\nbundle underscore home dot CSS file if you click on this it's going to take you\nyou click on this it's going to take you\nyou click on this it's going to take you to this sources tab which we're gonna\nto this sources tab which we're gonna\nto this sources tab which we're gonna come to later on right but what we see\ncome to later on right but what we see\ncome to later on right but what we see is down as we go we have other selectors\nis down as we go we have other selectors\nis down as we go we have other selectors which are applied so you see a star\nwhich are applied so you see a star\nwhich are applied so you see a star selector is applied to every tag so that\nselector is applied to every tag so that\nselector is applied to every tag so that is what it is then we have something\nis what it is then we have something\nis what it is then we have something known as user agent style sheets which\nknown as user agent style sheets which\nknown as user agent style sheets which are the style sheets the browser\nare the style sheets the browser\nare the style sheets the browser actually provides itself right so by\nactually provides itself right so by\nactually provides itself right so by default if you don't do anything to div\ndefault if you don't do anything to div\ndefault if you don't do anything to div browser says hey this should be a div\nbrowser says hey this should be a div\nbrowser says hey this should be a div should be a block right block element\nshould be a block right block element\nshould be a block right block element then it shows some styles which in which\nthen it shows some styles which in which\nthen it shows some styles which in which it inherits from its parents right\nit inherits from its parents right\nit inherits from

family and font it from its\nhere is font family and font it from its parent and then you know lower down the\nparent and then you know lower down the\nparent and then you know lower down the line it shows you everything and finally\nline it shows you everything and finally\nline it shows you everything and finally shows you this bounding box which would\nshows you this bounding box which would\nshows you this bounding box which would be a little bit more clear if we have\nbe a little bit more clear if we have\nbe a little bit more clear if we have some sort of inner element somewhere\nsome sort of inner element somewhere\nsome sort of inner element somewhere right here right so if we see this\nright here right so if we see this\nright here right so if we see this dashboard element if we go ahead and see\ndashboard element if we go ahead and see\ndashboard element if we go ahead and see this bounding box you're gonna see that\nthis bounding box you're gonna see that\nthis bounding box you're gonna see that we get this as the dimension of this\nwe get this as the dimension of this\nwe get this as the dimension of this thing right you could also see the\nthing right you could also see the\nthing right you could also see the dimension of this thing right here in\ndimension of this thing right here in\ndimension of this thing right here in the in that 1920 cross something which\nthe in that 1920 cross something which\nthe in that 1920 cross something which total wit but you see right here this is\ntotal wit but you see right here this is\ntotal wit but you see right here this is the actual content to it this is the\nthe actual content to it this is the\nthe actual content to it this is the padding applied you can see if I can\npadding applied you can see if I can\npadding applied you can see if I can just go ahead and you know get this back\njust go ahead and you know get this back\njust go ahead and you know get this back on fixed let me just reload this page\non fixed let me just reload this page\non fixed let me just reload this page once\nonce\nonce so that we have a white background that\nso that we have a white background that\nso that we have a white background that is much easier to see right so if we go\nis much easier to see right so if we go\nis much easier to see right so if we go ahead and on this bag on this dashboard\nahead and on this bag on this dashboard\nahead and on this bag on this dashboard we see that this content is in blue area\nwe see that this content is in blue area\nwe see that this content is in blue area the padding consists of the screen area\nthe padding consists of the screen area\nthe padding consists of the screen area now this is the border it does not have\nnow this is the border it does not have\nnow this is the border it does not have any border so you see it shows you - is\nany border so you see it shows you - is\nany border so you see it shows you - is here that the bot is not present and\nhere that the bot is not present and\nhere that the bot is not present and margin is also not present right so this\nmargin is also not present right so this\nmargin is also not present right so this is your bounding box for this particular\nis your bounding box for this particular\nis your bounding box for this particular element which you can see you probably\nelement which you can see you probably\nelement which you can see you probably won't need to use this a lot but you\nwon't need to use this a lot but you\nwon't need to use this a lot but you should know that just in case right\nshould know that just in case right\nshould know that just in case right apart from this you also have like\napart from this you also have like\napart from this you also have like computed tab where it shows you all the\ncomputed tab where it shows you all the\ncomputed tab where it shows you all the computed properties it has done for this\ncomputed properties it has done for this\ncomputed properties it has done for this particular element again you could check\nparticular element again you could check\nparticular element again you could check these properties out but you won't need\nthese properties out but you won't need\nthese properties out but you won't need to check them very often right we also\nto check them very often right we also\nto check them very often right we also have event listeners for this particular\nhave event listeners for this particular\nhave event listeners for this particular element you can go ahead and check them\nelement you can go ahead and check them\nelement you can go ahead and check them out but again you won't need to do that\nout but again you won't need to do that\nout but again you won't need to do that a lot right here so for the elements tab\na lot right here so for the elements tab\na lot right here so for the elements tab what we have importantly is just the\nwhat we have importantly is just the\nwhat we have importantly is just the HTML structure right here and the CSS\nHTML structure right here and the CSS\nHTML structure right here and the CSS properties which are present right here\nproperties which are present right here\nproperties which are present right here moving on to the console tab you're\nmoving on to the console tab you're\nmoving on to the console tab you're gonna see that you just get a pretty\ngonna see that you just get a pretty\ngonna see that you just get a pretty simple console right here which you can\nsimple console right here which you can\nsimple console right here which you can clear right so you can see these\nclear right so you can see these\nclear right so you can see these settings all these settings I'm just\nsettings all these settings I'm just\nsettings all these settings I'm just gonna remove this resolve lock so that\ngonna remove this resolve lock so that\ngonna remove this resolve lock so that we can clear this console all right so\nwe can clear this console all right so\nwe can clear this console all right so whatever you execute here would be\nwhatever you execute here would be\nwhatever you execute here would be treated as your JavaScript which runs on\ntreated as your JavaScript which runs on\ntreated as your JavaScript which runs on this particular page so for example if\nthis particular page so for example if\nthis particular page

right\naway from the page you can do that right\naway from the page you can do that right you could change the context of this\nyou could change the context of this\nyou could change the context of this particular console so what happens is by\nparticular console so what happens is by\nparticular console so what happens is by default your console is running for this\ndefault your console is

let's say if I had a\nbut for example let's say if I had a\nbut for example let's say if I had a nice frame somewhere here so how do I\nnice frame somewhere here so how do I\nnice frame somewhere here so how do I jump into that so I could just click\njump into that so I could just click\njump into that so I could just click here just go to that particular iframe\nhere just go to that particular

this\nlet's just go to let's say this\nlet's just go to let's say this JavaScript basics and this one so what\nJavaScript basics and this one so what\nJavaScript basics and this one so what you're gonna see is we have an iframe\nyou're gonna see is we have an iframe\nyou're gonna see is we have an iframe right here so now if I click here I'm\nright here so now if I click here I'm\nright here so now if I click here I'm gonna see something like this which is\ngonna see something like this which is\ngonna see something like this which is this about blank and you can see that\nthis about blank and you can see that\nthis about blank and you can see that that iframe gets highlighted\nthat iframe gets highlighted\nthat iframe gets highlighted so when I click on this you can see that\nso when I click on this you can see that\nso when I click on this you can see that now I am particularly inside this\nnow I am particularly inside this\nnow I am particularly inside this console right and I can just verify that\nconsole right and I can just verify that\nconsole right and I can just verify that for you by typing check query I guess or\nfor you by typing check query I guess or\nfor you by

our sources\ncoming to next tab that is our sources\ncoming to next tab that is our sources tab what this tab does is that it pretty\ntab what this tab does is that it pretty\ntab what this tab does is that it pretty much consists of all the assets your\nmuch consists of all the assets your\nmuch consists of all the assets your browser fetches right pretty much every\nbrowser fetches right pretty

fetches\nhave the assets as the browser fetches\nhave the assets as the browser fetches them for example the CSS file the CSS\nthem for example the CSS file the CSS\nthem for example the CSS file the CSS file you can see all these tabs opening\nfile you can see all these tabs opening\nfile you can see all these tabs opening and what you could do to like make them\nand what you could do to like make them\nand what you could do to like make them at least readable is click on this\nat least readable is click on this\nat least readable is click on this format icon right so once you do that\nformat icon right so once you do that\nformat icon right so once you do that you see that you get a formatted version\nyou see that you get a formatted version\nyou see that you get a formatted version of that particular thing and now you can\nof that particular thing and now you can\nof that particular thing and now you can look around and see how this file looks\nlook around and see how this file looks\nlook around and see how this file looks like really useful in case of JavaScript\nlike really useful in case of JavaScript\nlike really useful in case of JavaScript JavaScript files right you see that this\nJavaScript files right you see that this\nJavaScript files right you see that this is a builded web back JSON file\nis a builded web back JSON file\nis a builded web back JSON file so that's why it does not make really\nso that's why it does not make really\nso that's why it does not make really make any sense but when you're debugging\nmake any sense but when you're debugging\nmake any sense but when you're debugging it when you're on localhost when you're\nit when you're on localhost when you're\nit when you're on localhost when you're developing the application it kind of\ndeveloping the application it kind of\ndeveloping the application it kind of makes sense a lot of sense right so yeah\nmakes sense a lot of sense right so yeah\nmakes sense a lot of sense right so yeah that's that now on the right you're\nthat's that now on the right you're\nthat's that now on the right you're gonna see this column called threads\ngonna see this column called threads\ngonna see this column called threads technically this is not threads it's\ntechnically this is not threads it's\ntechnically this is not threads it's just web workers with your main thread\njust web workers with your main thread\njust web workers with your main thread so you in JavaScript we do not have\nso you in JavaScript we do not have\nso you in JavaScript we do not have threading but kind of like a threading\nthreading but kind of like a threading\nthreading but kind of like a threading based environment using web workers\nbased environment using web workers\nbased environment using web workers right which you can think of as the\nright which you can think of as the\nright which you can think of as the JavaScript running in the background so\nJavaScript running in the background so\nJavaScript running in the background so this text editor Minako is using two web\nthis text editor Minako is using two web\nthis text editor Minako is using two web workers you can see right now at the\nworkers you can see right now at the\nworkers you can see right now at the moment so you can switch between those\nmoment so you can switch between those\nmoment so you can switch between those threads but usually you will be just\nthreads but usually you will be just\nthreads but usually you will be just working with the main thread right we\nworking with the main thread right we\nworking with the main thread right we have some watch column here you can add\nhave some watch column here you can add\nhave some watch column here you can add some variables here to watch to see when\nsome variables here to watch to see when\nsome variables here to watch to see when the value changes we have a call stack\nthe value changes we have a call stack\nthe value changes we have a call stack so if I just go ahead and pause the\nso if I just go ahead and pause the\nso if I just go ahead and pause the JavaScript execution somewhere you're\nJavaScript execution somewhere you're\nJavaScript execution somewhere you're gonna see that when I clicked on this\ngonna see that when I clicked on this\ngonna see that when I clicked on this pause button my grammar li extension in\npause button my grammar li extension in\npause button my grammar li extension in the browser was kind of like executing\nthe browser was kind of like executing\nthe browser was kind of like executing some sort of JavaScript statement and at\nsome sort of JavaScript statement and at\nsome sort of JavaScript statement and at that particular moment I just posted\nthat particular moment I just posted\nthat particular moment I just posted right so you see that debugger is paused\nright so you see that debugger is paused\nright so you see that debugger is paused and now in the call stack section we see\nand now in the call stack section we see\nand now in the call stack section we see how this particular where this\nhow this particular where this\nhow this particular where this particular call arrived from\nparticular call arrived from\nparticular call arrived from the moment where JavaScript code\nthe moment where JavaScript code\nthe moment where JavaScript code execution is happening right now so this\nexecution is happening right now so this\nexecution is happening right now so this is useful for example if you have placed\nis useful for example if you have placed\nis useful for example if you have placed a debugger breakpoint in your JavaScript\na debugger breakpoint in your JavaScript\na debugger breakpoint in your JavaScript code and you want to check how that\ncode and you want to check how that\ncode and you want to check how that particular you know how you reach to\nparticular you know how you reach to\nparticular you know how you reach to that particular point right so you can\nthat particular point right so you can\nthat particular point right so you can see right here in our case we add the\nsee right here in our case we add the\nsee right here in our case we add the Steidle flushed method which was called\nSteidle flushed method which was called\nSteidle flushed method which was called by this T dot request async whatever\nby this T dot request async whatever\nby this T dot request async whatever this is right which is further call by\nthis is right which is further call by\nthis is right which is further call by all these methods which are not\nall these methods which are not\nall these methods which are not interesting for us because we have not\ninteresting for us because we have not\ninteresting for us because we have not developed this right this is used for\ndeveloped this right this is used for\ndeveloped this right this is used for like if this is blue then it means that\nlike if this is blue then it means that\nlike if this is blue then it means that you're all breakpoints are deactivated\nyou're all breakpoints are deactivated\nyou're all breakpoints are deactivated right and since we do not really have\nright and since we do not really have\nright and since we do not really have list any debuggers right here so this\nlist any debuggers right here so this\nlist any debuggers right here so this doesn't really matter for us this means\ndoesn't really matter for us this means\ndoesn't really matter for us this means that you should pause your JavaScript\nthat you should pause your JavaScript\nthat you should pause your JavaScript execution whenever there's an exception\nexecution whenever there's an exception\nexecution whenever there's an exception occurring right so pretty useful again\noccurring right so pretty useful again\noccurring right so pretty useful again when you're developing applications and\nwhen you're developing applications and\nwhen you're developing applications and [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] that's that for the call stack pad the\nthat's that for the call stack pad the\nthat's that for the call stack pad the breakpoints part again consists of the\nbreakpoints part again consists of the\nbreakpoints part again consists of the parts of the code where you have\nparts of the code where you have\nparts of the code where you have specifically written this debugger\nspecifically written this debugger\nspecifically written this debugger keyword right so for example if you have\nkeyword right so for example if you have\nkeyword right so for example if you have a like function something important and\na like function something important and\na like function something important and you know something is not right here so\nyou know something is not right here so\nyou know something is not right here so what you do is you just after some some\nwhat you do is you just after some some\nwhat you do is you just after some some time at at some point you write a\ntime at at some point you write a\ntime at at some point you write a debugger here and then write rest of the\ndebugger here and then write rest of the\ndebugger here and then write rest of the code so if your console window is opened\ncode so if your console window is opened\ncode so if your console window is opened and you run this particular code what\nand you run this particular code what\nand you run this particular code what would happen is inside breakpoints that\nwould happen is inside breakpoints that\nwould happen is inside breakpoints that debugger would be listed and your code\ndebugger would be listed and your code\ndebugger would be listed and your code execution would be paused just like I\nexecution would be paused just like I\nexecution would be paused just like I showed you when we click on this pause\nshowed you when we click on this pause\nshowed you when we click on this pause button right so that's the point of\nbutton right so that's the point of\nbutton right so that's the point of breakpoints you can see all those break\nbreakpoints you can see all those break\nbreakpoints you can see all those break points there again this is because this\npoints there again this is because this\npoints there again this is because this is a production built of code time you\nis a production built of code time you\nis a production built of code time you don't see any breakpoints but and the\ndon't see any breakpoints but and the\ndon't see any breakpoints but and the development bill there are tons of those\ndevelopment bill

developer\nmost useful features of this developer\nmost useful features of this developer tools and show you how you can use it to\ntools and show you how you can use it to\ntools and show you how you can use it to debug issues on your website and make\ndebug issues on your website and make\ndebug issues on your website and make things easier for yourself I will show\nthings easier for yourself I will show\nthings easier for yourself I will show you each section and each features of\nyou each section and each features of\nyou each section and each features of the sections and we'll show you some\nthe sections and we'll show you some\nthe sections and we'll show you some real examples\nreal examples\nreal examples so I have opened the random website\nso I have opened the random website\nso I have opened the random website which happens to be my personal website\nwhich happens to be my personal website\nwhich happens to be my personal website by accident and now I'm going to open\nby accident and now I'm going to open\nby accident and now I'm going to open the developer tools and the simplest way\nthe developer tools and the simplest way\nthe developer tools and the simplest way to do this is by right clicking on the\nto do this is by right clicking on the\nto do this is by right clicking on the page and select inspect or you can just\npage and select inspect or you can just\npage and select inspect or you can just press F12 on your um system or open it\npress F12 on your um system or open it\npress F12 on your um system or open it by this three dots here and on more\nby this three dots here and on more\nby this three dots here and on more tools it would be your developer tools\ntools it would be your developer tools\ntools it would be your developer tools here okay so now uh you can see that I\nhere okay so now uh you can see that I\nhere okay so now uh you can see that I have different tabs here elements\nhave different tabs here elements\nhave different tabs here elements console sources Network performance and\nconsole sources Network performance and\nconsole sources Network performance and there's also more tabs which are which\nthere's also more tabs which are which\nthere's also more tabs which are which have more advanced uses but the first\nhave more advanced uses but the first\nhave more advanced uses but the first stab that we're going to deal with and\nstab that we're going to deal with and\nstab that we're going to deal with and the one that might be the simplest one\nthe one that might be the simplest one\nthe one that might be the simplest one is the elements tab in this tab we have\nis the elements tab in this tab we have\nis the elements tab in this tab we have the complete D of the page rendered and\nthe complete D of the page rendered and\nthe complete D of the page rendered and we can also see these tiles and interact\nwe can also see these tiles and interact\nwe can also see these tiles and interact with some of the JavaScript in the page\nwith some of the JavaScript in the page\nwith some of the JavaScript in the page as as you can see all the server side\nas as you can see all the server side\nas as you can see all the server side codes like PHP and Python and whatever\ncodes like PHP and Python and whatever\ncodes like PHP and Python and whatever it is is rendered to this final HTML\nit is is rendered to this final HTML\nit is is rendered to this final HTML things\nthings\nthings here and each of them has certain\nhere and each of them has certain\nhere and each of them has certain attributes like classes HFS\nattributes like classes HFS\nattributes like classes HFS IDs and they also have some styles that\nIDs and they also have some styles that\nIDs and they also have some styles that you can see on the right hand side here\nyou can see on the right hand side here\nyou can see on the right hand side here to select an element and see more of it\nto select an element and see more of it\nto select an element and see more of it you can either hover over it in\nyou can either hover over it in\nyou can either hover over it in the left hand side here or you can\nthe left hand side here or you can\nthe left hand side here or you can select this locator\nselect this locator\nselect this locator here and just pick your element by\nhere and just pick your element by\nhere and just pick your element by hovering over it for example I want to\nhovering over it for example I want to\nhovering over it for example I want to choose this section\nchoose this section\nchoose this section here and if I click on it I will see the\nhere and if I click on it I will see the\nhere and if I click on it I will see the dumb here I open this tag and I can see\ndumb here I open this tag and I can see\ndumb here I open this tag and I can see that it has a paragraph here and a div\nthat it has a paragraph here and a div\nthat it has a paragraph here and a div element with a button here inside it\nelement with a button here inside it\nelement with a button here inside it okay now if I click on this um anchor\nokay now if I click on this um anchor\nokay now if I click on this um anchor here I can see the styles for this\nhere I can see the styles for this\nhere I can see the styles for this button and one important thing to know\nbutton and one important thing to know\nbutton and one important thing to know is that the priority of this styles for\nis that the priority of this styles for\nis that the priority of this styles for this button\nthis button\nthis button here are in the same order as the styles\nhere are in the same order as the styles\nhere are in the same order as the styles that I see here so this is the priority\nthat I see here so this is the priority\nthat I see here so this is the priority of the Styles and you can see that some\nof the Styles and you can see that some\nof the Styles and you can see that some of them like this cursor text line have\nof them like this cursor text line have\nof them like this cursor text line have have been crossed out and that is\nhave been crossed out and that is\nhave been crossed out and that is because there is\nbecause there is\nbecause there is some other higher priority cursor rule\nsome other higher priority cursor rule\nsome other higher priority cursor rule here on top of it that overwrites this\nhere on top of it that overwrites this\nhere on top of it that overwrites this one so whenever you see a stle rule that\none so whenever you see a stle rule that\none so whenever you see a stle rule that is crossed out it means that another\nis crossed out it means that another\nis crossed out it means that another higher level has overridden\nit another time you see some rules that\nit another time you see some rules that are\nare\nare faded and this means that these rules\nfaded and this means that these rules\nfaded and this means that these rules simply don't apply to this element you\nsimply don't apply to this element you\nsimply don't apply to this element you might write them but for this certain\nmight write them but for this certain\nmight write them but for this certain element they don't apply and because\nelement they don't apply and because\nelement they don't apply and because this Flex scow is for the elements that\nthis Flex scow is for the elements that\nthis Flex scow is for the elements that have a display of flex but this anchor\nhave a display of flex but this anchor\nhave a display of flex but this anchor doesn't simply have it another time you\ndoesn't simply have it another time you\ndoesn't simply have it another time you might see a yellow triangle on the left\nmight see a yellow triangle on the left\nmight see a yellow triangle on the left side of um your rule and that means that\nside of um your rule and that means that\nside of um your rule and that means that that value is not valid so for example\nthat value is not valid so for example\nthat value is not valid so for example in this text transform if I write a\nin this text transform if I write a\nin this text transform if I write a number it would be invalid because this\nnumber it would be invalid because this\nnumber it would be invalid because this has to be a certain word like\nhas to be a certain word like\nhas to be a certain word like capitalizer lowercase but if I write a\ncapitalizer lowercase but if I write a\ncapitalizer lowercase but if I write a number it would simply tell me that it's\nnumber it would simply tell me that it's\nnumber it would simply tell me that it's invalid property\ninvalid property\ninvalid property value these are the best ways to debug\nvalue these are the best ways to debug\nvalue these are the best ways to debug your CSS issues on your website and it\nyour CSS issues on your website and it\nyour CSS issues on your website and it will help you to find the exact point\nwill help you to find the exact point\nwill help you to find the exact point that your code is broken\nthat your code is broken\nthat your code is broken because when you have an overridden rule\nbecause when you have an overridden rule\nbecause when you have an overridden rule or some invalid properties you will know\nit another part of this style is that\nit another part of this style is that the are styles that this um button\nthe are styles that this um button\nthe are styles that this um button inherits from it parent element for\ninherits from it parent element for\ninherits from it parent element for example this button inherits the\nexample this button inherits the\nexample this button inherits the Overflow W from this element because in\nOverflow W from this element because in\nOverflow W from this element because in the D Tree it has a higher\nlevel sometimes there are some user\nlevel sometimes there are some user agent to stylish it and this means that\nagent to stylish it and this means that\nagent to stylish it and this means that these Styles has been applied by your\nthese Styles has been applied by your\nthese Styles has been applied by your browser which in our case is Chrome so\nbrowser which in our case is Chrome so\nbrowser which in our case is Chrome so for each uh div element you have a\nfor each uh div element you have a\nfor each uh div element you have a display of block and a unic b of isolate\ndisplay of block and a unic b of isolate\ndisplay of block and a unic b of isolate I don't know what it is that but these\nI don't know what it is that but these\nI don't know what it is that but these styles are applied by your browser and\nstyles are applied by your browser and\nstyles are applied by your browser and you cannot change them you can overwrite\nyou cannot change them you can overwrite\nyou cannot change them you can overwrite them but you cannot change them and\nthem but you cannot change them and\nthem but you cannot change them and these are the default styles that Chrome\nthese are the default styles that Chrome\nthese are the default styles that Chrome has if you're using a another browser\nhas if you're using a another browser\nhas if you're using a another browser they might apply another Styles like I\nthey might apply another Styles like I\nthey might apply another Styles like I know that Safari applies some uh a lot\nknow that Safari applies some uh a lot\nknow that Safari applies some uh a lot of user agent\nof user agent\nof user agent stylesheet if you want to see that where\nstylesheet if you want to see that where\nstylesheet if you want to see that where this style has been written in your\nthis style has been written in your\nthis style has been written in your files and your theme or\nfiles and your theme or\nfiles and your theme or plugins you can click on this link which\nplugins you can click on this link which\nplugins you can click on this link which will show you the exact location or the\nwill show you the exact location or the\nwill show you the exact location or the source of the Styles which in our case\nsource of the Styles which in our case\nsource of the Styles which in our case is in the main uh PHP file it's it's an\nis in the main uh PHP file it's it's an\nis in the main uh PHP file it's it's an inline CSS so this is not really helpful\ninline CSS so this is not really helpful\ninline CSS so this is not really helpful most of the time you have this style in\nmost of the time you have this style in\nmost of the time you have this style in a separate CSS file which in this case\na separate CSS file which in this case\na separate CSS file which in this case it is an inline CSS in the main file and\nit is an inline CSS in the main file and\nit is an inline CSS in the main file and it is also on the sources tab we will\nit is also on the sources tab we will\nit is also on the sources tab we will get to that uh tab with more details\nget to that uh tab with more details\nget to that uh tab with more details later there are one more useful things\nlater there are one more useful things\nlater there are one more useful things in this style tab here that I want to\nin this style tab here that I want to\nin this style tab here that I want to show you and that is the state of the\nshow you and that is the state of the\nshow you and that is the state of the element or sometimes you can call it in\nelement or sometimes you can call it in\nelement or sometimes you can call it in CS PSE sudo classes they are not really\nCS PSE sudo classes they are not really\nCS PSE sudo classes they are not really classes but pseudo classes so for\nclasses but pseudo classes so for\nclasses but pseudo classes so for example this button um when I hover over\nexample this button um when I hover over\nexample this button um when I hover over it you can see that the background color\nit you can see that the background color\nit you can see that the background color changes but in the normal CSS tab uh the\nchanges but in the normal CSS tab uh the\nchanges but in the normal CSS tab uh the normal Styles tab here I cannot see the\nnormal Styles tab here I cannot see the\nnormal Styles tab here I cannot see the styles for this button when it's hovered\nstyles for this button when it's hovered\nstyles for this button when it's hovered so what I need to do is to\nso what I need to do is to\nso what I need to do is to change the state of this button let me\nchange the state of this button let me\nchange the state of this button let me select it here in the D and change the\nselect it here in the D and change the\nselect it here in the D and change the state of it to\nstate of it to\nstate of it to hover and now you can see that I have\nhover and now you can see that I have\nhover and now you can see that I have this background color here so let's make\nthis background color here so let's make\nthis background color here so let's make some changes to this button and actually\nsome changes to this button and actually\nsome changes to this button and actually see it in action this is a variable and\nsee it in action this is a variable and\nsee it in action this is a variable and if you click on it you will see a whole\nif you click on it you will see a whole\nif you click on it you will see a whole section of the variables that we use on\nsection of the variables that we use on\nsection of the variables that we use on this\npage and you can change it just here I\npage and you can change it just here I will change it to Red which is a very\nwill change it to Red which is a very\nwill change it to Red which is a very noticeable\nnoticeable\nnoticeable color and and I Chang the state of it to\ncolor and and I Chang the state of it to\ncolor and and I Chang the state of it to hover and now I have the background\nhover and now I have the background\nhover and now I have the background color when it's hovered as you can see\ncolor when it's hovered as you can see\ncolor when it's hovered as you can see in the real name\nin the real name\nin the real name here okay I change this background color\nhere okay I change this background color\nhere okay I change this background color to another noticeable color like\nto another noticeable color like\nto another noticeable color like green and now uh when I change this is\ngreen and now uh when I change this is\ngreen and now uh when I change this is state to\nstate to\nstate to normal I can see the changes that I have\nnormal I can see the changes that I have\nnormal I can see the changes that I have applied then if I refresh the page the\napplied then if I refresh the page the\napplied then if I refresh the page the good thing about this developer tools is\ngood thing about this developer tools is\ngood thing about this developer tools is that all the changes don't take effect\nthat all the changes don't take effect\nthat all the changes don't take effect on the real website and they are all\non the real website and they are all\non the real website and they are all temporary and you can't make any real\ntemporary and you can't make any real\ntemporary and you can't make any real change to the\nchange to the\nchange to the website\nwebsite\nwebsite now there is the computed tab here and\nnow there is the computed tab here and\nnow there is the computed tab here and if you click on\nif you click on\nif you click on it you see this box here which is really\nit you see this box here which is really\nit you see this box here which is really helpful it shows you the actual width\nhelpful it shows you the actual width\nhelpful it shows you the actual width and\nand\nand height of this box it'll show you the\nheight of this box it'll show you the\nheight of this box it'll show you the padding it'll show you the border and it\npadding it'll show you the border and it\npadding it'll show you the border and it will show you the\nwill show you the\nwill show you the margin and under the real page they\nmargin and under the real page they\nmargin and under the real page they would be in the same order like the\nwould be in the same order like the\nwould be in the same order like the first padding and then border and then\nfirst padding and then border and then\nfirst padding and then border and then margin this gives us a really good\nmargin this gives us a really good\nmargin this gives us a really good visualization of these properties and\nvisualization of these properties and\nvisualization of these properties and one other cool thing about it is that\none other cool thing about it is that\none other cool thing about it is that you can just double click on it and\nyou can just double click on it and\nyou can just double click on it and change it\nchange it\nchange it here and although it doesn't take\nhere and although it doesn't take\nhere and although it doesn't take permanent effect on the website you can\npermanent effect on the website you can\npermanent effect on the website you can see the effect effect and just do trial\nsee the effect effect and just do trial\nsee the effect effect and just do trial and error and if I want to change the\nand error and if I want to change the\nand error and if I want to change the Border as well I can change it to\nBorder as well I can change it to\nBorder as well I can change it to 10\n10\n10 and just the left margin I can also\nand just the left margin I can also\nand just the left margin I can also change it to 100 and you will see it\nchange it to 100 and you will see it\nchange it to 100 and you will see it here now one uh more difference between\nhere now one uh more difference between\nhere now one uh more difference between this computed Tab and sty tab is that\nthis computed Tab and sty tab is that\nthis computed Tab and sty tab is that here we have the whole list of the CSS\nhere we have the whole list of the CSS\nhere we have the whole list of the CSS uh rules that are applying to this\nuh rules that are applying to this\nuh rules that are applying to this element in this case this anchor element\nelement in this case this anchor element\nelement in this case this anchor element here and some of them are crossed out\nhere and some of them are crossed out\nhere and some of them are crossed out some of them are not taking effect some\nsome of them are not taking effect some\nsome of them are not taking effect some of them are\nof them are\nof them are invalid and this is not a really clean\ninvalid and this is not a really clean\ninvalid and this is not a really clean list of the things that is happening to\nlist of the things that is happening to\nlist of the things that is happening to this element so if I want to see a clean\nthis element so if I want to see a clean\nthis element so if I want to see a clean list of all the CSS properties for this\nlist of all the CSS properties for this\nlist of all the CSS properties for this element I would go to the computed tab\nelement I would go to the computed tab\nelement I would go to the computed tab to see the final output of all the CSS\nto see the final output of all the CSS\nto see the final output of all the CSS rules here\nrules here\nrules here in the background color I can see that\nin the background color I can see that\nin the background color I can see that the final background color that has been\nthe final background color that has been\nthe final background color that has been um taken effect for this element is this\num taken effect for this element is this\num taken effect for this element is this color and these are the Border bottom uh\ncolor and these are the Border bottom uh\ncolor and these are the Border bottom uh with radius and color and all the other\nwith radius and color and all the other\nwith radius and color and all the other ones so these are basically all the\nones so these are basically all the\nones so these are basically all the rules that we have defined for this\nrules that we have defined for this\nrules that we have defined for this element and on the button here you can\nelement and on the button here you can\nelement and on the button here you can also see the font for this element so\nalso see the font for this element so\nalso see the font for this element so this uh the difference between this and\nthis uh the difference between this and\nthis uh the difference between this and the other one is that this is a way more\nthe other one is that this is a way more\nthe other one is that this is a way more clean list and this is the final output\nclean list and this is the final output\nclean list and this is the final output of the CSS\nof the CSS\nof the CSS rules in the layout tab here you will\nrules in the layout tab here you will\nrules in the layout tab here you will see two main sections one is called grid\nsee two main sections one is called grid\nsee two main sections one is called grid and the other one is called Flex Flex\nand the other one is called Flex Flex\nand the other one is called Flex Flex box and what they actually do is to\nbox and what they actually do is to\nbox and what they actually do is to demonstrate the outlines and the\ndemonstrate the outlines and the\ndemonstrate the outlines and the structures of your page if they are\nstructures of your page if they are\nstructures of your page if they are using grid or if they are using flexbox\nusing grid or if they are using flexbox\nusing grid or if they are using flexbox so in this case our page is is not using\nso in this case our page is is not using\nso in this case our page is is not using grid and it's using flexbox and if I\ngrid and it's using flexbox and if I\ngrid and it's using flexbox and if I check either of these\ncheck either of these\ncheck either of these elements it'll show it better on my page\nelements it'll show it better on my page\nelements it'll show it better on my page and it will show the outlines the border\nand it will show the outlines the border\nand it will show the outlines the border and the whole structure of the page if\nand the whole structure of the page if\nand the whole structure of the page if you don't know what grid and flexbox are\nyou don't know what grid and flexbox are\nyou don't know what grid and flexbox are they are the two main methods right now\nthey are the two main methods right now\nthey are the two main methods right now in the CSS to design the layout of your\nin the CSS to design the layout of your\nin the CSS to design the layout of your page now these are just for debug\npage now these are just for debug\npage now these are just for debug purposes and to just see the actual\npurposes and to just see the actual\npurposes and to just see the actual layout of your page and in the flex boox\nlayout of your page and in the flex boox\nlayout of your page and in the flex boox overlay section here as I hover over\noverlay section here as I hover over\noverlay section here as I hover over these\nthese\nthese elements I can see them on the page and\nelements I can see them on the page and\nelements I can see them on the page and if I check them I can see that how much\nif I check them I can see that how much\nif I check them I can see that how much space has this Flex box is\nspace has this Flex box is\nspace has this Flex box is taken I can see the actual borders of\ntaken I can see the actual borders of\ntaken I can see the actual borders of this and I can see that here there is a\nthis and I can see that here there is a\nthis and I can see that here there is a gap and if I select another element\nlike this one I can also see that where\nlike this one I can also see that where is this element on the\npage and also you can see that as I\npage and also you can see that as I select these there is this little batch\nselect these there is this little batch\nselect these there is this little batch here and that is because here we have\nhere and that is because here we have\nhere and that is because here we have this patch settings and you can enable\nthis patch settings and you can enable\nthis patch settings and you can enable it and if this element has any of these\nit and if this element has any of these\nit and if this element has any of these badges it if it has a grid box layout if\nbadges it if it has a grid box layout if\nbadges it if it has a grid box layout if it has a flex layout or it's a media or\nit has a flex layout or it's a media or\nit has a flex layout or it's a media or something else it'll show it on the Dom\nsomething else it'll show it on the Dom\nsomething else it'll show it on the Dom this is a really cool feature too so\nthis is a really cool feature too so\nthis is a really cool feature too so this section is for seeing the actual\nthis section is for seeing the actual\nthis section is for seeing the actual Flex box or the grid layout of your\nFlex box or the grid layout of your\nFlex box or the grid layout of your elements in the\nelements in the\nelements in the page another tab here is the event\npage another tab here is the event\npage another tab here is the event listeners\nlisteners\nlisteners Tab and the list that you you see here\nTab and the list that you you see here\nTab and the list that you you see here are the actual events that have a\nare the actual events that have a\nare the actual events that have a callback functions in your\ncallback functions in your\ncallback functions in your JavaScript you can see some of these are\nJavaScript you can see some of these are\nJavaScript you can see some of these are self-explanatory like the Click one\nself-explanatory like the Click one\nself-explanatory like the Click one Keepers load and this one is for the\nKeepers load and this one is for the\nKeepers load and this one is for the page is completely loaded this is for\npage is completely loaded this is for\npage is completely loaded this is for the contact form 7\nthe contact form 7\nthe contact form 7 plugin and all of these\nplugin and all of these\nplugin and all of these events have something going on for\nevents have something going on for\nevents have something going on for example when I click on the document\nexample when I click on the document\nexample when I click on the document there's a call back function that if I\nthere's a call back function that if I\nthere's a call back function that if I click on it it'll show me that what it\nclick on it it'll show me that what it\nclick on it it'll show me that what it will do which is in this case nothing\nwill do which is in this case nothing\nwill do which is in this case nothing this function does nothing okay and here\nthis function does nothing okay and here\nthis function does nothing okay and here on the elements tab again if I scroll\non the elements tab again if I scroll\non the elements tab again if I scroll the P page and scroll the\nthe P page and scroll the\nthe P page and scroll the window I can see that it will clear the\nwindow I can see that it will clear the\nwindow I can see that it will clear the timeat and do some unnecessary thing\ntimeat and do some unnecessary thing\ntimeat and do some unnecessary thing okay so if you have uh this different\nokay so if you have uh this different\nokay so if you have uh this different event listeners on your website you\nevent listeners on your website you\nevent listeners on your website you would actually be able to see the call\nwould actually be able to see the call\nwould actually be able to see the call back functions and then work with\nback functions and then work with\nback functions and then work with it now let me refresh the page to show\nit now let me refresh the page to show\nit now let me refresh the page to show you the Dom break\nyou the Dom break\nyou the Dom break points okay now we have three other\npoints okay now we have three other\npoints okay now we have three other parts here which is D breakpoints\nparts here which is D breakpoints\nparts here which is D breakpoints properties and accessibility but we will\nproperties and accessibility but we will\nproperties and accessibility but we will get to these later as we go to the\nget to these later as we go to the\nget to these later as we go to the console and sources and also performance\nconsole and sources and also performance\nconsole and sources and also performance tab which these are more useful when we\ntab which these are more useful when we\ntab which these are more useful when we get to those parts\nin the left hand side on the\nin the left hand side on the elements when I right click on an Dom\nelements when I right click on an Dom\nelements when I right click on an Dom node I have different options and the\nnode I have different options and the\nnode I have different options and the first one we of course is ask AI we have\nfirst one we of course is ask AI we have\nfirst one we of course is ask AI we have ai here too as we have everywhere these\nai here too as we have everywhere these\nai here too as we have everywhere these days so apparently I have to turn it on\ndays so apparently I have to turn it on\ndays so apparently I have to turn it on let me just quickly enable AI for\nlet me just quickly enable AI for\nlet me just quickly enable AI for this and hopefully y it works now\nthis and hopefully y it works now\nthis and hopefully y it works now so I think I can just ask some questions\nso I think I can just ask some questions\nso I think I can just ask some questions uh or I can just make him do stuff for\nme okay so I just asked this AI to give\nme okay so I just asked this AI to give me the style of this element in Grid\nme the style of this element in Grid\nme the style of this element in Grid which I think then uh default one is in\nwhich I think then uh default one is in\nwhich I think then uh default one is in Flex box I'm not sure I I think I\nFlex box I'm not sure I I think I\nFlex box I'm not sure I I think I targeted the wrong element but anyway it\ntargeted the wrong element but anyway it\ntargeted the wrong element but anyway it will give me um the element with the\nwill give me um the element with the\nwill give me um the element with the gridbox CSS which is actually really\ngridbox CSS which is actually really\ngridbox CSS which is actually really cool and I can use it on my website so I\ncool and I can use it on my website so I\ncool and I can use it on my website so I think if you want to debug some CSS\nthink if you want to debug some CSS\nthink if you want to debug some CSS issues or you want to change the style\nissues or you want to change the style\nissues or you want to change the style or do anything else you can ask this Ai\nor do anything else you can ask this Ai\nor do anything else you can ask this Ai and it will help\nand it will help\nand it will help you and this add attribute edit\nyou and this add attribute edit\nyou and this add attribute edit attribute and edit as HTML and all the\nattribute and edit as HTML and all the\nattribute and edit as HTML and all the other things you can just double click\nother things you can just double click\nother things you can just double click on any of these and edit it the tag name\non any of these and edit it the tag name\non any of these and edit it the tag name attributes um the attributes value you\nattributes um the attributes value you\nattributes um the attributes value you can edit it you can duplicate the\ncan edit it you can duplicate the\ncan edit it you can duplicate the element or delete\nelement or delete\nelement or delete it and uh one useful part is this copy\nit and uh one useful part is this copy\nit and uh one useful part is this copy part which lets you copy the element\npart which lets you copy the element\npart which lets you copy the element outter HTML or the selector if you want\noutter HTML or the selector if you want\noutter HTML or the selector if you want to add some style to this element in\nto add some style to this element in\nto add some style to this element in your CSS file one thing you can do is to\nyour CSS file one thing you can do is to\nyour CSS file one thing you can do is to grab this uh grab the selector from this\ngrab this uh grab the selector from this\ngrab this uh grab the selector from this part\npart\npart which is WP blog group class or simply\nwhich is WP blog group class or simply\nwhich is WP blog group class or simply copy the selector here which will be\ncopy the selector here which will be\ncopy the selector here which will be this okay\nthis okay\nthis okay and you can copy the\nand you can copy the\nand you can copy the selector which will be this as you can\nselector which will be this as you can\nselector which will be this as you can see I can paste it here and it's main\nsee I can paste it here and it's main\nsee I can paste it here and it's main tag with some\ntag with some\ntag with some ID and the JS path would help you in\nID and the JS path would help you in\nID and the JS path would help you in your draw script codes so in the console\nyour draw script codes so in the console\nyour draw script codes so in the console tab if I uh write it um let me\njust\njust okay doesn't allow me to paste any code\nokay doesn't allow me to paste any code\nokay doesn't allow me to paste any code and it tells me that I'm not\nand it tells me that I'm not\nand it tells me that I'm not understanding what I'm doing so I need\nunderstanding what I'm doing so I need\nunderstanding what I'm doing so I need to turn this off there was a chance that\nto turn this off there was a chance that\nto turn this off there was a chance that you also might have this enabled too so\nyou also might have this enabled too so\nyou also might have this enabled too so let's turn this off\nlet's turn this off\nlet's turn this off so be careful of what you're typing in\nso be careful of what you're typing in\nso be careful of what you're typing in your console because this might actually\nyour console because this might actually\nyour console because this might actually interact with your website and not that\ninteract with your website and not that\ninteract with your website and not that it can change anything on the server but\nit can change anything on the server but\nit can change anything on the server but it can reveal some information from your\nit can reveal some information from your\nit can reveal some information from your website that you don't want to so if I\nwebsite that you don't want to so if I\nwebsite that you don't want to so if I type allow pasting and just hit\nenter okay that worked because I had an\nenter okay that worked because I had an extra space here and now if I paste this\nextra space here and now if I paste this\nextra space here and now if I paste this code I have the the JavaScript path to\ncode I have the the JavaScript path to\ncode I have the the JavaScript path to this element and I can Target this\nthis element and I can Target this\nthis element and I can Target this element in my JavaScript files with this\nelement in my JavaScript files with this\nelement in my JavaScript files with this code and the other options in this um\ncode and the other options in this um\ncode and the other options in this um copy are copy Styles and copy X paath so\ncopy are copy Styles and copy X paath so\ncopy are copy Styles and copy X paath so if I copy all of the styles for this\nif I copy all of the styles for this\nif I copy all of the styles for this element and then paste it here it would\nelement and then paste it here it would\nelement and then paste it here it would be an unnecessary thing but just to uh\nbe an unnecessary thing but just to uh\nbe an unnecessary thing but just to uh show you that it can be done so I've\nshow you that it can be done so I've\nshow you that it can be done so I've just pasted a bunch of style here that I\njust pasted a bunch of style here that I\njust pasted a bunch of style here that I just duplicated when they are already\njust duplicated when they are already\njust duplicated when they are already applied to this element and as you can\napplied to this element and as you can\napplied to this element and as you can see all of them here are overridden and\nsee all of them here are overridden and\nsee all of them here are overridden and crossed out because I have a higher\ncrossed out because I have a higher\ncrossed out because I have a higher priority\nhere another interesting part of this is\nhere another interesting part of this is that I can set break points here and\nthat I can set break points here and\nthat I can set break points here and that is uh for this part which is Dum\nthat is uh for this part which is Dum\nthat is uh for this part which is Dum break\nbreak\nbreak points you can actually Define

we use the\nI created in Javascript file we use the log function when we want to just uh\nlog function when we want to just uh\nlog function when we want to just uh print simple\nprint simple\nprint simple information we also can use console\nwarning and we can also use the console\nwarning and we can also use the console error\nhowever these are the things that uh we\nhowever these are the things that uh we don't deliberately write but they just\ndon't deliberately write but they just\ndon't deliberately write but they just get produced by the codes that we have\nget produced by the

okay now I need to to filter all the\nokay now I need to to filter all the\nokay now I need to to filter all the things that I have and make sure that\nthings that I have and make sure that\nthings that I have and make sure that all of them are\nall of them are\nall of them are showing I have this warning and this\nshowing I have this warning and this\nshowing I have this warning and this error and if I click on this link here\nerror and if I click on this link here\nerror and if I click on this link here it will show me that where exactly is\nit will show me that where exactly is\nit will

Let me actually give\nChrome extension. Let me actually give\nChrome extension. Let me actually give you a really quick example. So, I have a\nyou a really quick example. So, I have a\nyou a really quick example. So, I have a basic extension here. It has a\nbasic extension here. It has a\nbasic extension here. It has a background.js file that opens\nbackground.js file that opens\nbackground.js file that opens index.html.\nindex.html.\nindex.html. And then index.html has a script tag\nAnd then index.html has a script tag\nAnd then index.html has a script tag which is loading this index.jsx file.\nwhich is loading this index.jsx file.\nwhich is loading this index.jsx file. And this is a really simple react app\nAnd this is a really simple react app\nAnd this is a really simple react app which is just rendering hello world to\nwhich is just rendering hello world to\nwhich is just rendering hello world to the page. And then I have ES build since\nthe page. And then I have ES build since\nthe page. And then I have ES build since I'm using JSX for templating and that\nI'm using JSX for templating and that\nI'm using JSX for templating and that needs a compile step. And then I can go\nneeds a compile step. And then I can go\nneeds a compile step. And then I can go ahead and I can run this. I can load\nahead and I can run this. I can load\nahead and I can run this. I can load this in the browser. And you can see\nthis in the browser. And you can see\nthis in the browser. And you can see that the page opens and we see the hello\nthat the page opens and we see the hello\nthat the page opens and we see the hello world. So this works great. Now, there\nworld. So this works great. Now, there\nworld. So this works great. Now, there are lots of different contexts where an\nare lots of different contexts where an\nare lots of different contexts where an extension might want to show UI and\nextension might want to show UI and\nextension might want to show UI and there are some different considerations\nthere are some different considerations\nthere are some different considerations for the framework that you might pick in\nfor the framework that you might pick in\nfor the framework that you might pick in each case. So, let's talk through each\neach case. So, let's talk through each\neach case. So, let's talk through each of those. I have the Google dictionary\nof those. I have the Google dictionary\nof those. I have the Google dictionary extension installed in my browser. So,\nextension installed in my browser. So,\nextension installed in my browser. So, we can use that as quite a nice example.\nwe can use that as quite a nice example.\nwe can use that as quite a nice example. This is actually one that I helped to\nThis is actually one that I helped to\nThis is actually one that I helped to migrate to manifest v3 and I know how it\nmigrate to manifest v3 and I know how it\nmigrate to manifest v3 and I know how it works quite well.\nworks quite well.\nworks quite well. If I click the action icon, we can see\nIf I click the action icon, we can see\nIf I click the action icon, we can see the popup. And if I inspect the pop-up,\nthe popup. And if I inspect the pop-up,\nthe popup. And if I inspect the pop-up, you can see that this is just HTML and\nyou can see that this is just HTML and\nyou can see that this is just HTML and JavaScript. It's fully isolated, so\nJavaScript. It's fully isolated, so\nJavaScript. It's fully isolated, so whatever you run isn't going to bloat\nwhatever you run isn't going to bloat\nwhatever you run isn't going to bloat the page. And you might want a pretty\nthe page. And you might want a pretty\nthe page. And you might want a pretty complex application here. So using a\ncomplex application here. So using a\ncomplex application here. So using a framework which is very capable makes a\nframework which is very capable makes a\nframework which is very capable makes a lot of sense. Now, you still want to be\nlot of sense. Now, you still want to be\nlot of sense. Now, you still want to be mindful of performance, but I would say\nmindful of performance, but I would say\nmindful of performance, but I would say you don't need to worry as much here. My\nyou don't need to worry as much here. My\nyou don't need to worry as much here. My experience is that React can take longer\nexperience is that React can take longer\nexperience is that React can take longer to bootstrap than other options, for\nto bootstrap than other options, for\nto bootstrap than other options, for example, but I think it would be a\nexample, but I think it would be a\nexample, but I think it would be a reasonable choice here. If I go to a\nreasonable choice here. If I go to a\nreasonable choice here. If I go to a page and highlight a word, you can see\npage and highlight a word, you can see\npage and highlight a word, you can see this pop-up. This pop-up we want to show\nthis pop-up. This pop-up we want to show\nthis pop-up. This pop-up we want to show really quickly, and we might be showing\nreally quickly, and we might be showing\nreally quickly, and we might be showing multiple of these pop-ups over time, so\nmultiple of these pop-ups over time, so\nmultiple of these pop-ups over time, so a heavy framework probably isn't the\na heavy framework probably isn't the\na heavy framework probably isn't the right choice. Something like spelt would\nright choice. Something like spelt would\nright choice. Something like spelt would be great here, or even just vanilla\nbe great here, or even just vanilla\nbe great here, or even just vanilla JavaScript. In the case of the Google\nJavaScript. In the case of the Google\nJavaScript. In the case of the Google dictionary extension, we're using the\ndictionary extension, we're using the\ndictionary extension, we're using the mustache templating engine. So, actually\nmustache templating engine. So, actually\nmustache templating engine. So, actually not a framework at all, but it makes it\nnot a framework at all, but it makes it\nnot a framework at all, but it makes it a little easier to structure our code\na little easier to structure our code\na little easier to structure our code and ultimately just gives us HTML that\nand ultimately just gives us HTML that\nand ultimately just gives us HTML that we can add to the page. By the way,\nwe can add to the page. By the way,\nwe can add to the page. By the way, injecting content into the page means\ninjecting content into the page means\ninjecting content into the page means that the page has access to it. If\nthat the page has access to it.

If that's a concern, consider iframes at\nthat's a concern, consider iframes at\nthat's a concern, consider iframes at the very least, or honestly, just try to\nthe very least, or honestly, just try to\nthe very least, or honestly, just try to avoid it entirely. That's a whole rabbit\navoid it entirely. That's a whole rabbit\navoid it entirely. That's a whole rabbit hole in itself. It could be a whole\nhole in itself. It could be a whole\nhole in itself. It could be a whole video, but if you're interested in\nvideo, but if you're interested in\nvideo, but if you're interested in hearing more about that, feel free to\nhearing more about that, feel free to\nhearing more about that, feel free to let me know in the comments. Let's also\nlet me know in the comments. Let's also\nlet me know in the comments. Let's also go to the extension and open up the\ngo to the extension and open up the\ngo to the extension and open up the options page. And this is again a fully\noptions page. And this is again a fully\noptions page. And this is again a fully isolated page. So I can add script tags\nisolated page. So I can add script tags\nisolated page. So I can add script tags and use whatever framework I prefer. I'd\nand use whatever framework I prefer. I'd\nand use whatever framework I prefer. I'd say this is more similar to the pop-up\nsay this is more similar to the pop-up\nsay this is more similar to the pop-up case where whatever works for you is\ncase where whatever works for you is\ncase where whatever works for you is probably okay. Now, there are some\nprobably okay. Now, there are some\nprobably okay. Now, there are some frameworks that you probably shouldn't\nframeworks that you probably shouldn't\nframeworks that you probably shouldn't pick. Not because there's anything wrong\npick.

stack trace of the code execution\nOutput stack trace of the code execution now the other feature that we're going\nnow the other feature that we're going\nnow the other feature that we're going to talk about is the sources feature I'm\nto talk about is the sources feature I'm\nto talk about is the sources feature I'm only going to talk about a few of them\nonly going to talk about a few of them\nonly going to talk about a few of them that are really really important so the\nthat are really really important so the\nthat are really really important so the sources panel allows developers to debug\nsources panel allows developers to debug\nsources panel allows developers to debug and profile JavaScript code set\nand profile JavaScript code set\nand profile JavaScript code set breakpoints and inspect the call stack\nbreakpoints and inspect the call stack\nbreakpoints and inspect the call stack the sources panel also provides a\nthe sources panel also provides a\nthe sources panel also provides a comprehensive set of debugging tools\ncomprehensive set of debugging tools\ncomprehensive set of debugging tools such as conditional breakpoints watch\nsuch as conditional breakpoints watch\nsuch as conditional breakpoints watch expressions and code stepping so if you\nexpressions and code stepping so if you\nexpressions and code stepping so if you you are familiar with the debugger this\nyou are familiar with the debugger this\nyou are familiar with the debugger this section over here called sources this is\nsection over here called sources this is\nsection over here called sources this is where you implement your debugger you\nwhere you implement your debugger you\nwhere you implement your debugger you can actually step into your JavaScript\ncan actually step into your JavaScript\ncan actually step into your JavaScript code so for example if we wanted to we\ncode so for example if we wanted to we\ncode so for example if we wanted to we can Implement a breakpoint somewhere\ncan Implement a breakpoint somewhere\ncan Implement a breakpoint somewhere here and this will allow the code to\nhere and this will allow the code to\nhere and this will allow the code to execute up until this point over here so\nexecute up until this point over here so\nexecute up until this point over here so that we can really get into our code and\nthat we can really

let's\nmost of it in this one video now let's\nmost of it in this one video now let's go in let's go into the network panel\ngo in let's go into the network panel\ngo in let's go into the network panel it's one of the most important parts of\nit's one of the most important parts of\nit's one of the most important parts of our our our features inside of chrome\nour our our features inside of chrome\nour our our features inside of chrome Dev tools now this panel allows this\nDev tools now this panel allows this\nDev tools now this panel allows this panel allows developers to Monitor and\npanel allows developers to Monitor and\npanel allows developers to Monitor and analyze network activity including HTTP\nanalyze network activity including HTTP\nanalyze network activity including HTTP requests and responses and measure the\nrequests and responses and measure the\nrequests and responses and measure the performance of a web page the network\nperformance of a web page the

resources as well\nthe size and timing of resources as well\nthe size and timing of resources as well as identifying and diagnosing\nas identifying and diagnosing\nas identifying and diagnosing performance issues so let's take for\nperformance issues so let's take for\nperformance issues so let's take for example look at this image over here\nexample look at this image over here\nexample look at this image over here this is the time it took for us to\nthis is the time it took for us to\nthis is the time it took for us to actually load this image into our\nactually load this image into our\nactually load this image into our website that's 22\nwebsite that's 22\nwebsite that's 22 milliseconds so sometimes there's some\nmilliseconds so sometimes there's some\nmilliseconds so sometimes there's some images that take quite a while to\nimages that take quite a while to\nimages that take quite a while to actually load or render as an image can\nactually load or render as an image can\nactually load or render as an image can take about 10 seconds so if you have an\ntake about 10 seconds so if you have an\ntake about 10 seconds so if you have an image that is taking about 10 seconds in\nimage that is taking about 10 seconds in\nimage that is taking about 10 seconds in order to to load then you actually know\norder to to load then you actually know\norder to to load then you actually know that you might have a problem\nthat you might have a problem\nthat you might have a problem so this is whereby you inspect the\nso this is whereby you inspect the\nso this is whereby you inspect the network activity if you have HTTP\nnetwork activity if you have HTTP\nnetwork activity if you have HTTP request you can come over you can click\nrequest you can come over you can click\nrequest you can come over you can click to fetch xhr I mean actually navigate to\nto fetch xhr I mean actually navigate to\nto fetch xhr I mean actually navigate to a website that is going to allow us to\na website that is going to allow us to\na website that is going to allow us to look at each of these individual issues\nlook at each of these individual issues\nlook at each of these individual issues and analyze the network activity for\nand analyze the network activity for\nand analyze the network activity for each of them\neach of them\neach of them so I've resorted to the Google Website\nso I've resorted to the Google Website\nso I've resorted to the Google Website in order to see a little bit more about\nin order to see a little bit more about\nin order to see a little bit more about the networking panel so you can see\nthe networking panel so you can see\nthe networking panel so you can see these are all the elements these are all\nthese are all the elements these are all\nthese are all the elements these are all the elements that are included in our\nthe elements that are included in our\nthe elements that are included in our networking panel so what it essentially\nnetworking panel so what it essentially\nnetworking panel so what it essentially does it measures the amount of time it\ndoes it measures the amount of time it\ndoes it measures the amount of time it takes for all those elements to load it\ntakes for all those elements to load it\ntakes for all those elements to load it also gives you the size of those\nalso gives you the size of

status\nthose elements and the the http status\nthose elements and the the http status of those individual elements so we can\nof those individual elements so we can\nof those individual elements so we can also see the amount of the like we yeah\nalso see the amount of the like we yeah\nalso see the amount of the like we yeah we can go into each of those elements\nwe can go into each of those elements\nwe can go into each of those elements and actually see more information about\nand actually see more information about\nand actually see more information about them and see the time it took for all of\nthem and see the time it took for all of\nthem and see the time it took for all of them to be loaded you can see I think\nthem to be loaded you can see I think\nthem to be loaded you can see I think the most that an element took to to load\nthe most that an element took to to load\nthe most that an element took to to load was this manifest that took over 683\nwas this manifest that took over 683\nwas this manifest that took over 683 milliseconds so if you have a website\nmilliseconds so if you have a website\nmilliseconds so if you have a website like this which takes about\nlike this which takes about\nlike this which takes about 59.45 seconds to load its resources then\n59.45 seconds to load its resources then\n59.45 seconds to load its resources then you have a I think a very fairly good\nyou have a I think a very fairly good\nyou have a I think a very fairly good website and if you have if the Dom\nwebsite and if you have if the Dom\nwebsite and if you have if the Dom content is loaded within three seconds\ncontent is loaded within three seconds\ncontent is loaded within three seconds then you have a fully a good functioning\nthen you have a fully a good functioning\nthen you have a fully a good functioning website in terms of performance once I\nwebsite in terms of performance once I\nwebsite in terms of performance once I get on the networking panel you can like\nget on the networking panel you can like\nget on the networking panel you can like separate each of those elements so that\nseparate each of those elements so that\nseparate each of those elements so that you can just look at them individually\nyou can just look at them individually\nyou can just look at them individually so you can see this is our HTTP all our\nso you can see

You can see right here Chrome is being controlled by\nhere Chrome is being controlled by\nhere Chrome is being controlled by automated test software. So, it's not\nautomated test software. So, it's not\nautomated test software. So, it's not like a typical browser window. Um, this\nlike a typical browser window. Um, this\nlike a typical browser window. Um, this is this is basically basically kind of\nis this is basically basically kind of\nis this is basically basically kind of what I wanted almost. Uh, because I\nwhat I wanted almost. Uh, because I\nwhat I wanted almost. Uh, because I didn't grab the the actual background\ndidn't grab the the actual background\ndidn't grab the the actual background color. One of the things you might be\ncolor. One of the things you might be\ncolor. One of the things you might be intrigued to do like in the past is hit\nintrigued to do like in the past is hit\nintrigued to do like in the past is hit control shift I. You can open up the\ncontrol shift I. You can open up the\ncontrol shift I. You can open up the elements area and we have all these CSS\nelements area and we have all these CSS\nelements area and we have all these CSS properties that we can then adjust. Now,\nproperties that we can then adjust. Now,\nproperties that we can then adjust. Now, for instance, let's say we want to\nfor instance, let's say we want to\nfor instance, let's say we want to change the background color to a\nchange the background color to a\nchange the background color to a specific color, right? Um, I could say\nspecific color, right? Um, I could say\nspecific color, right? Um, I could say background\nbackground\nbackground and then paste this in. Okay. Now, when\nand then paste this in. Okay. Now, when\nand then paste this in. Okay. Now, when you make that change, which we just did\nyou make that change, which we just did\nyou make that change, which we just did right here, and we hit refresh,\nright here, and we hit refresh,\nright here, and we hit refresh, it doesn't persist. It doesn't get saved\nit doesn't persist. It doesn't get saved\nit doesn't persist. It doesn't get saved to your codebase. People who've been in\nto your codebase. People who've been in\nto your codebase. People who've been in the know understand this for millennia,\nthe know understand this for millennia,\nthe know understand this for millennia, right? Well, if I make that change\nright? Well, if I make that change\nright? Well, if I make that change again, I just say background and paste\nagain, I just say background and paste\nagain, I just say background and paste the same thing. And then I go back to\nthe same thing. And then I go back to\nthe same thing. And then I go back to the M uh to cursor and I say\nI just made a CSS change\nI just made a CSS change via the dev inspector in Chrome.\nvia the dev inspector in Chrome.\nvia the dev inspector in Chrome. Integrate those changes to our code.\nIntegrate those changes to our code.\nIntegrate those changes to our code. So what it will do is it's going to use\nSo what it will do is it's going to use\nSo what it will do is it's going to use the MCP server for dev tools and it's\nthe MCP server for dev tools and it's\nthe MCP server for dev tools and it's going to analyze all the properties and\ngoing to analyze all the properties and\ngoing to analyze all the properties and compare you know the differences between\ncompare you know the differences between\ncompare you know the differences between the codebase that exists in index.html\nthe codebase that exists in index.html\nthe codebase that exists in index.html and what exists in the Chrome dev tools\nand what exists in the Chrome dev tools\nand what exists in the Chrome dev tools uh in the dev inspector that I\nuh in the dev inspector that I\nuh in the dev inspector that I integrated. And so now you can see the\nintegrated. And so now you can see the\nintegrated. And so now you can see the change is actually persisted. If I\nchange is actually persisted. If I\nchange is actually persisted. If I refresh, guess what? It it it works. The\nrefresh, guess what? It it it works. The\nrefresh, guess what? It it it works. The the background changes. Now I know that\nthe background changes. Now I know that\nthe background changes. Now I know that doesn't sound like a big deal. It's just\ndoesn't sound like a big deal. It's just\ndoesn't sound like a big deal. It's just one CSS property. We could have done\none CSS property. We could have done\none CSS property. We could have done that in the the CSS ourselves, but if\nthat in the the CSS ourselves, but if\nthat in the the CSS ourselves, but if you have a bunch of properties and you\nyou have a bunch of properties and you\nyou have a bunch of properties and you want to change a bunch of things here in\nwant to change a bunch of things here in\nwant to change a bunch of things here in the dev inspector without having to try\nthe dev inspector without having to try\nthe dev inspector without having to try to find, especially have a large project\nto find, especially have a large project\nto find, especially have a large project with you have a bunch of component\nwith you have a bunch of component\nwith you have a bunch of component files, CSS is scattered everywhere.

So now\nit will persist those changes. So now\nit will persist those changes. So now you can truly design in the browser and\nyou can truly design in the browser and\nyou can truly design in the browser and not lose those uh code changes. It\nnot lose those uh code changes.

All right. So, watch what ends up\nAll right. So, watch what ends up\nAll right. So, watch what ends up happening.\nSo, it says called click.\nSo, it says called click. It's going to\nIt's going to\nIt's going to call take snapshot. It clicked on it.\ncall take snapshot. It clicked on it.\ncall take snapshot. It clicked on it.

So it calls all these different tools to\nSo it calls all these different tools to\nSo it calls all these different tools to ensure that it works. And that is\nensure that it works.

And that is freaking cool because then in the\nfreaking cool because then in the\nfreaking cool because then in the context of a real project, you can tell\ncontext of a real project, you can tell\ncontext of a real project, you can tell it to interact with your UI elements and\nit to interact with your UI elements and\nit to interact with your UI elements and do certain things and like input like\ndo certain things and like input like\ndo certain things and like input like put text into text fields and all that\nput text into text fields and all that\nput text into text fields and all that and hit send.

we'll have\nof some simple sums so we'll have\nof some simple sums so we'll have function\nfunction\nfunction do sums and then we will console.log\ndo sums and then we will console.log\ndo sums and then we will console.log to plus two i'll copy that three more\nto plus two i'll copy that three more\nto plus two i'll copy that three more times\ntimes\ntimes and we'll have two minus two\nand we'll

This area over here on the left, uh, well,\narea over here on the left, uh, well,\narea over here on the left, uh, well, yeah, we got these render blocking\nyeah, we got these render blocking\nyeah, we got these render blocking requests. And you can see, well, we're\nrequests. And you can see, well, we're\nrequests. And you can see, well, we're blocked in render. So, let's just mark\nblocked in render. So, let's just mark\nblocked in render. So, let's just mark that down. Under\nthat down. Under\nthat down. Under blocked by\nblocked by\nblocked by network. Another thing, we can see this\nnetwork.

And here it is evaluating. And that\nAnd here it is evaluating. And that\nAnd here it is evaluating. And that relationship between network and main\nrelationship between network and main\nrelationship between network and main thread is really key. So let's make that\nthread is really key.

Um, it takes a while to\ninteraction. Um, it takes a while to show the user the visual effect of their\nshow the user the visual effect of their\nshow the user the visual effect of their click. Most of the time is in processing\nclick. Most of the time is in processing\nclick. Most of the time is in processing and within that we're tracking the click\nand within that we're tracking the click\nand within that we're tracking the click for analytics. If you ask me, they don't\nfor analytics. If you ask me, they don't\nfor analytics. If you ask me, they don't need to know about the click before the\nneed to know about the click before the\nneed to know about the click before the user does. So, how can we fix it?\nuser does. So, how can we fix it?\nuser does. So, how can we fix it? So these insights, you can actually ask\nSo these insights, you can actually ask\nSo these insights, you can actually ask the AI for more specific advice on how\nthe AI for more specific advice on how\nthe AI for more specific advice on how to tackle them personalized to your\nto tackle them personalized to your\nto tackle them personalized to your trace. Yeah, suggest fixes. That's\ntrace. Yeah, suggest fixes. That's\ntrace. Yeah, suggest fixes. That's perfect. Okay, this will use metadata\nperfect. Okay, this will use metadata\nperfect. Okay, this will use metadata from the insight and tool use to collect\nfrom the insight and tool use to collect\nfrom the insight and tool use to collect additional data from the trace. All\nadditional data from the trace. All\nadditional data from the trace. All right, so the processing duration is the\nright, so the processing duration is the\nright, so the processing duration is the most significant contributor. Uh we\nmost significant contributor. Uh we\nmost significant contributor. Uh we recommend bringing up long tasks. Uh\nrecommend bringing up long tasks. Uh\nrecommend bringing up long tasks. Uh perhaps using set timeout and this will\nperhaps using set timeout and this will\nperhaps using set timeout and this will allow the browser to yield to the main\nallow the browser to yield to the main\nallow the browser to yield to the main thread. Okay, you know what? This\nthread. Okay, you know what? This\nthread. Okay, you know what? This actually gels exactly with what I was\nactually gels exactly with what I was\nactually gels exactly with what I was thinking would work. Um well, let's try\nthinking would work. Um well, let's try\nthinking would work. Um well, let's try out that fix right now. We'll click into\nout that fix right now. We'll click into\nout that fix right now. We'll click into the track event function and we'll just\nthe track event function and we'll just\nthe track event function and we'll just add this in and this will allow us to\nadd this in and this will allow us to\nadd this in and this will allow us to yield to the main\nyield to the main\nyield to the main thread. All right. Okay. Let's take a\nthread. All right. Okay. Let's take a\nthread. All right. Okay. Let's take a look and see what kind of effect this\nlook and see what kind of effect this\nlook and see what kind of effect this has.\nAnd all right, new trace. The INP that\nAnd all right, new trace. The INP that we just had was 190\nwe just had was 190\nwe just had was 190 milliseconds. So, moment of\nmilliseconds. So, moment of\nmilliseconds. So, moment of truth. Oh, yeah. The new INP is 99\ntruth. Oh, yeah. The new INP is 99\ntruth. Oh, yeah. The new INP is 99 milliseconds. Uh, definitely faster. And\nmilliseconds. Uh, definitely faster. And\nmilliseconds. Uh, definitely faster. And the processing duration is a lot quicker\nthe processing duration is a lot quicker\nthe processing duration is a lot quicker because we deferred that non-critical\nbecause we deferred that non-critical\nbecause we deferred that non-critical work. And boom goes the dynamite. It's\nwork. And boom goes the dynamite. It's\nwork. And boom goes the dynamite. It's not just about finding the problem, it's\nnot just about finding the problem, it's\nnot just about finding the problem, it's about fixing it\nabout fixing it\nabout fixing it effectively. So, there you have it. From\neffectively. So, there you have it. From\neffectively. So, there you have it. From understanding real world data to getting\nunderstanding real world data to getting\nunderstanding real world data to getting actionable insights and verifying your\nactionable insights and verifying your\nactionable insights and verifying your improvements, it's all designed to make\nimprovements, it's all designed to make\nimprovements, it's all designed to make your job easier and your websites\nyour job easier and your websites\nyour job easier and your websites faster. I'd really love to hear what you\nfaster. I'd really love to hear what you\nfaster. I'd really love to hear what you think about these features. Let me know\nthink about these features.
