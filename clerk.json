To add clerkMiddleware() to your app, follow these steps:\n\nCreate a src/start.ts file with the following code:\n\nsrc/start.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\nimport { createStart } from '@tanstack/react-start'\n\nexport const startInstance = createStart(() => {\n  return {\n    requestMiddleware: [clerkMiddleware()],\n  }\n})\n\nBy default, clerkMiddleware() will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the \nclerkMiddleware() reference\n to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.\n\nAdd <ClerkProvider> to your app\n\nThe \n<ClerkProvider>\n component provides session and user context to Clerk's hooks and components. It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with <ClerkProvider> to make authentication globally accessible. See the \nreference docs\n for other configuration options.\n\nAdd the <ClerkProvider> component to your app's root route, as shown in the following example:\n\nsrc/routes/__root.tsx\n+ import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\n\n32 lines collapsed\n  function RootDocument({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n    return (\n      <html lang=\"en\">\n        <head>\n          <HeadContent />\n        </head>\n        <body>\n+         <ClerkProvider>\n            <Header />\n            {children}\n+         </ClerkProvider>\n          <TanStackRouterDevtools />\n          <Scripts />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\nProtect your pages\nClient-side\n\nTo protect your pages on the client-side, you can use Clerk's \nprebuilt control components\n that control the visibility of content based on the user's authentication state.\n\nThe following example uses the following components:\n\n<SignedIn>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed in.\n<SignedOut>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed out.\n<UserButton />\n: Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.\n<SignInButton />\n: An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or environment variables are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the Account Portal sign-in page.\n<SignUpButton />\n: An unstyled component that links to the sign-up page. In this example, since no props or environment variables are set for the sign-up URL, this component links to the Account Portal sign-up page.\nsrc/routes/index.tsx\nimport {\n  SignedIn,\n  UserButton,\n  SignedOut,\n  SignInButton,\n  SignUpButton,\n} from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: Home,\n})\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Index Route</h1>\n      <header>\n        {/* Show the sign-in and sign-up buttons when the user is signed out */}\n        <SignedOut>\n          <SignInButton />\n          <SignUpButton />\n        </SignedOut>\n        {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}\n        <SignedIn>\n          <UserButton />\n        </SignedIn>\n      </header>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nServer-side\n\nTo protect your routes, create a server function⁠ that checks the user's authentication state via the \nauth()\n method. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to a sign-in page. If authenticated, the user's userId is passed to the route, allowing access to the <Home /> component, which welcomes the user and displays their userId. The beforeLoad()⁠ method ensures authentication is checked before loading the page, and the loader()⁠ method returns the user data for use in the component.\n\nTip\n\nEnsure that your app has the TanStack Start server handler⁠ configured in order for your server routes to work.\n\nsrc/routes/index.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute, redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nconst authStateFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {\n  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await auth()\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    // This will error because you're redirecting to a path that doesn't exist yet\n    // You can create a sign-in route to handle this\n    // See https://clerk.com/docs/tanstack-react-start/guides/development/custom-sign-in-or-up-page\n    throw redirect({\n      to: '/sign-in',\n    })\n  }\n\n  return { userId }\n})\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: Home,\n  beforeLoad: async () => await authStateFn(),\n  loader: async ({ context }) => {\n    return { userId: context.userId }\n  },\n})\n\nfunction Home() {\n  const state = Route.useLoaderData()\n\n  return <h1>Welcome! Your ID is {state.userId}!</h1>\n}\nRun your project\n\nRun your project with the following command:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm run dev\nCreate your first user\nVisit your app's homepage at http://localhost:3000⁠.\nSelect \"Sign up\" on the page and authenticate to create your first user.\nNext steps\n\nLearn more about Clerk components, how to customize them, and how to use Clerk's client-side helpers using the following guides.\n\nPrebuilt components\n\nLearn how to quickly add authentication to your app using Clerk's suite of components.\n\nCustomization & localization\n\nLearn how to customize and localize Clerk components.\n\nCreate a custom sign-in-or-up page\n\nLearn how to create a custom sign-in-or-up page with Clerk components.\n\nProtect content and read user data\n\nLearn how to use Clerk's hooks and helpers to protect content and read user data in your TanStack React Start app.\n\nClient-side helpers (hooks)\n\nLearn more about Clerk's client-side helpers and how to use them.\n\nClerk TanStack React Start SDK Reference\n\nLearn about the Clerk TanStack React Start SDK and how to integrate it into your app.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This page walks through integration options, prebuilt components, configuration steps, and the key objects you'll use as you build your application.\n\nWays to implement Clerk\n\nClerk provides three ways to integrate authentication into your application, depending on the level of control and customization you need:\n\nAccount Portal (default): Uses Clerk's prebuilt components on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers. Every Clerk application has this enabled by default, providing a complete user management interface out of the box.\nPrebuilt components\n: All-in-one UI components that can be integrated into your application. They are fully customizable to match your application's branding and design. This is the recommended approach for most use cases.\nCustom flows⁠ using the Clerk API: Build your own UI using the Clerk API. This option provides maximum flexibility and control over the user experience but requires more development effort.\n\nClerk offers a comprehensive suite of prebuilt components designed to seamlessly integrate authentication and multi-tenancy into your application. Components, like <SignIn />, <UserButton />, and <OrganizationSwitcher />, are all-in-one solutions that handle the full lifecycle of the user experience, from sign-up/sign-in to user profile and Organization management.\n\nThe Account Portal uses these components on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers. These pages cannot be customized beyond the options provided in the Clerk Dashboard⁠.\n\nFor more control and customization, you can migrate away from the Account Portal and embed the prebuilt components directly into your own application pages. While they are \nfully customizable\n to match your application's branding and design using CSS or special props, the HTML structure and the logic/ordering of the authentication flow remain fixed.\n\nIf the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you need complete control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. However, this is more advanced and it's recommended to use the prebuilt components whenever possible.\n\nTip\n\nMost applications usually progress from the Account Portal to prebuilt components as they grow, with custom flows used for advanced cases.\n\nConfiguring your application\n\nConfiguring your application is done through the Clerk Dashboard⁠. The Clerk Dashboard is where you, as the application owner, can manage your application's settings, users, and organizations.\n\nFor example, you can:\n\nEnable phone number authentication or multi-factor authentication.\nAdd social providers like Google.\nDelete users or create Organizations.\nInvite other users to your workspace to help configure and manage your application.\n\nTo get started, see the configuration docs, which include dedicated guides for specific configuration options.\n\nBuilding your application\nSession token\n\nWhen a user is authenticated in your application, Clerk generates a short-lived session token that you can use to authenticate requests to your backend. This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains information about the user and their session.\n\nRead more about Clerk session tokens and how they work in the guide on how Clerk works.\n\nKey Clerk objects\n\nThe Clerk JavaScript SDK, or ClerkJS, is where Clerk all started. It is the core SDK that powers all other JavaScript SDKs, including React and Next.js. As you build, you'll likely interact with the following objects.\n\nClerk\n\nThe Clerk class is the main entry point for the Clerk JavaScript SDK. All other objects are accessible from the Clerk object. As you're building your application, you'll likely interact with these objects, either directly or through helpers provided by the other SDKs, like React hooks or Vue composables.\n\nClient\n\nA client represents the current device or software accessing an application such as your web browser, native application, or Chrome Extension. It is represented by the Client object.\n\nSession\n\nA session is a secure representation of the authentication state of the current user. Each client can hold multiple sessions on the same device. It is represented by the Session object.\n\nUser\n\nThe User object represents the current user of the session. It holds all the basic user information such as the user's name, email addresses, and phone numbers, and including their public, private, and unsafe metadata.\n\nOrganization\n\nOrganizations are a flexible and scalable way to manage users and their access to resources within your Clerk application. With Organizations, you can assign specific Roles and Permissions to users, making them useful for managing projects, coordinating teams, or facilitating partnerships.\n\nUsers can belong to many Organizations. One of them will be the Active Organization⁠ of the session. It is represented by the Organization object. To learn about Organizations, see the dedicated guide.\n\nSign in\n\nThe SignIn object holds the state of the current sign-in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-in process. It is used to manage the sign-in lifecycle, including the first⁠ and second⁠ factor verification, and the creation of a new session.\n\nSign up\n\nThe SignUp object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.\n\nDeep dive\n\nFor a deeper dive into how Clerk works, like how our authentication model works, see the dedicated guide.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

By using the email address as the common identifier, Clerk automatically attempts to link accounts whenever possible. Account linking is triggered when an OAuth provider returns an email address that matches an existing account, assuming a single owner for each email address.\n\nHow it works\n\nWhen a user attempts to sign in or sign up, Clerk first checks the provided email address. Clerk will attempt to link the OAuth account with any existing Clerk account that shares the same email address.\n\nIn the following sections, we'll look at the different scenarios that can occur during this process and explain how Clerk handles each one.\n\nEmail address is verified in both OAuth and Clerk\n\nWhen a user signs in to your app using an OAuth provider that returns a verified email address, Clerk links the OAuth account to the existing account and signs the user in. This even applies to password-protected accounts, as the OAuth sign-in process automatically bypasses password verification.\n\nEmail address is verified in Clerk but not in OAuth\n\nWhen a user signs in to your app using an OAuth provider that returns an unverified email address, Clerk will initiate a verification process. Once the email address is verified, the OAuth account is linked to the existing one, and the user is signed in.\n\nEmail address is unverified in Clerk\n\nBy default, users are required to verify their email addresses before they can sign up.\n\nIf you disabled the Verify at sign-up option in the Clerk Dashboard⁠, users will be able to sign up without verifying their email addresses.\n\nWhen a user signs up with an unverified email address and later attempts to sign in with an OAuth provider, Clerk implements security measures to prevent potential account takeovers. For example, if an account was created with an unverified email/password combination and the user later signs in with Google (where the email is verified), Clerk will prompt the user to change their password before linking the accounts. This process begins with email verification, regardless of the method used. After successful verification, Clerk may require additional steps, such as validating existing connections or passwords, to ensure the account's security. These measures are in place because Clerk cannot confirm the original ownership of the account, which could otherwise lead to unauthorized access.\n\nUsers with different email addresses\n\nIf a user has a different email from the one associated with the OAuth account, they can manually associate the two by following these steps:\n\nSign in to their Clerk application with the account that uses their main email address.\nIn the \n<UserProfile />\n, add the different email.\n\nAfter following these steps, the user's OAuth accounts associated with both their primary and added email addresses will be linked to their main account.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

For example, if you enable Google as a social provider, then when a user wants to sign in to your application, they can select Google and use their Google account to sign in.\n\nNote\n\nWhen using social connections, the sign-up and sign-in flows are equivalent. If a user doesn't have an account and tries to sign in, an account will be made for them, and vice versa.\n\nThe easiest way to add social connections to your Clerk app is by using \nprebuilt components\n. If prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API.\n\nBefore you start\nYou need to create a Clerk application in the Clerk Dashboard⁠. For more information, check out the setup guide.\nYou need to install the correct SDK for your application. For more information, see the quickstart guides.\nEnable a social connection\nDevelopment instances\n\nFor development instances, Clerk uses pre-configured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs to make the development flow as smooth as possible. This means that you can enable most social providers without additional configuration.\n\nTo enable a social connection:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect the Add connection button, and select For all users.\nSelect the provider you want to use.\nProduction instances\n\nFor production instances, you will need to configure the provider with custom OAuth credentials. See the social provider's dedicated guide for more information.\n\nConfigure additional OAuth scopes\n\nEach OAuth provider requires a specific set of scopes that are necessary for proper authentication with Clerk. These essential scopes are pre-configured and automatically included by Clerk. They typically include permissions for basic profile information and email access, which are fundamental for user authentication and account creation.\n\nIn addition to the core scopes, you can specify additional scopes supported by the provider. These scopes can be used to access additional user data from the provider.\n\nTo add additional OAuth scopes, when you are enabling a new social connection, enable Use custom credentials. The Scopes field will appear.\n\nRequest additional OAuth scopes after sign-up\n\nClerk allows you to request additional OAuth scopes even after a user has signed up.\n\nPass the \nadditionalOAuthScopes\n prop to the \n<UserProfile/>\n or \n<UserButton />\n component, with any additional OAuth scope you would like per provider. The user will be prompted to reconnect their account on their user profile page.\n\nUse the following tabs to see how to add additional OAuth scopes to the <UserProfile/> and <UserButton/> components.\n\n<UserProfile />\n<UserButton />\napp/page.tsx\n<UserProfile\n  additionalOAuthScopes={{\n    google: ['foo', 'bar'],\n    github: ['qux'],\n  }}\n/>\nGet an OAuth access token for a social provider\n\nYou can use a social provider's OAuth access token⁠ to access user data from that provider in addition to their data from Clerk.\n\nUse the getUserOauthAccessToken() method to get the user's OAuth access token. This method must be used in a server environment, and cannot be run on the client.\n\nNote\n\nClerk does not automatically keep OAuth access tokens fresh behind the scenes. When you request an access token using the relevant backend API endpoint⁠, Clerk will attempt to obtain a fresh access token as well as a new refresh token. However, this process occurs only when you initiate the request; Clerk does not proactively refresh tokens on your behalf.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to retrieve the OAuth access token for a user and use it to fetch user data from the Notion API. It assumes:\n\nYou have already enabled the Notion social connection in the Clerk Dashboard.\nThe user has already connected their Notion account to your application.\nThe user has the correct permissions to access the Notion API.\n\nIf your SDK isn't listed, you can use the comments in the example to help you adapt it to your SDK.\n\nNext.js\nAstro\nExpress\nJS Backend SDK\nReact Router\nTanStack React Start\napp/routes/api/notion.tsx\nimport { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nexport const ServerRoute = createFileRoute('/api/notion')({\n  server: {\n    handlers: {\n      GET: async () => {\n        // The `Auth` object gives you access to properties like `isAuthenticated` and `userId`\n        // Accessing the `Auth` object differs depending on the SDK you're using\n        // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object\n        const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await auth()\n\n        // Protect the route from unauthenticated users\n        if (!isAuthenticated) {\n          return new Response('User not authenticated', {\n            status: 404,\n          })\n        }\n\n        const provider = 'notion'\n\n        // Initialize the JS Backend SDK\n        // This varies depending on the SDK you're using\n        // https://clerk.com/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart\n        // Use the `getUserOauthAccessToken()` method to get the user's OAuth access token\n        const clerkResponse = await clerkClient().users.getUserOauthAccessToken(userId, provider)\n        const accessToken = clerkResponse.data[0].token || ''\n        if (!accessToken) {\n          return new Response('Access token not found', {\n            status: 401,\n          })\n        }\n\n        // Fetch the user data from the Notion API\n        // This endpoint fetches a list of users\n        // https://developers.notion.com/reference/get-users\n        const notionUrl = 'https://api.notion.com/v1/users'\n\n        const notionResponse = await fetch(notionUrl, {\n          headers: {\n            Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,\n            'Notion-Version': '2022-06-28',\n          },\n        })\n\n        // Handle the response from the Notion API\n        const notionData = await notionResponse.json()\n\n        return json(notionData)\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\nAdd a social connection after sign-up\n\nFor each social provider, you can disable the option to sign up and sign in to your application using the provider. This is especially useful for users that want to connect their OAuth account after authentication.\n\nFor example, say your application wants to read a user's GitHub repository data but doesn't want to allow the user to authenticate with their GitHub account. The user can sign up with their email and password, or whatever authentication method you choose, and then afterwards, connect their GitHub account to your application through their user profile. The easiest way to enable this for your users is by using the \n<UserProfile />\n component. If you prefer to build a custom user interface, see how to build a social connection flow using the Clerk API.\n\nTo configure the option for users to sign up and sign in with a social provider:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect the social provider you want to configure.\nEnable or disable Enable for sign-up and sign-in.\nSave the changes.\nConnecting to social providers while signed in\n\nWhen signed in, a user can connect to further social providers. There is no need to perform another sign-up.\n\nWhen using the Account Portal pages, users can see which providers they have already connected to and which ones they can still connect to on their user profile page.\n\nWhen using the \nprebuilt components\n, you can use the \n<UserProfile/>\n component to allow users to connect to further social providers.\n\nOAuth for native applications\n\nCurrently, the prebuilt components are not supported in native applications, but you can use the Clerk API to build a custom flow for authenticating with social connections.\n\nClerk ensures that security critical nonces are passed only to allowlisted URLs when the SSO flow is completed in native browsers or webviews. For maximum security in your production instances, you need to allowlist your custom redirect URLs via the Clerk Dashboard⁠ or the Clerk Backend API.\n\nTo allowlist a redirect URL via the Clerk Dashboard:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Native applications⁠ page.\nScroll down to the Allowlist for mobile SSO redirect section and add your redirect URLs.\n\nNote\n\nBy default, Clerk uses {bundleIdentifier}://callback as the redirect URL.\n\nOAuth for Apple native applications\n\nYou can use Sign in with Apple⁠ to offer a native authentication experience in your iOS, watchOS, macOS or tvOS apps.\n\nInstead of the typical OAuth flow that performs redirects in a browser context, you can utilize Apple's native authorization and provide the openID token and grant code to Clerk. Clerk ensures that the user will be verified in a secure and reliable way with the information that Apple has provided about the user.\n\nFor additional information on how to configure Apple as a social provider for your Clerk instance, see the dedicated guide.\n\nSupported social providers\n\nClerk provides a wide range of social providers to ease your user's sign-up and sign-in processes.

This guide will walk you through each option.\n\nYou can modify your authentication options after your application has been created by navigating to the Clerk Dashboard⁠ and selecting any of the options under User & authentication in the left sidenav.\n\nUser & authentication\n\nTo configure the options available to users for authentication, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nThe easiest way to allow your users to create and manage their authentication options is to use the prebuilt \n<UserProfile>\n component. If you're building a custom user interface using the Clerk API, refer to the custom flow guides.\n\nEmail\n\nUsers can authenticate with their email address using the following options:\n\nEmail verification code: Users receive an OTP⁠ to their email address to sign in.\nEmail verification link: Users receive an email with a link to sign in. As a security measure, email links expire after 10 minutes to prevent the use of compromised or stale links.\nRequire the same device and browser: Email links are required to be verified from the same device and browser on which the sign-up or sign-in was initiated. For example:\nA user tries to sign in from their desktop browser.\nThey open the email link on their mobile phone to verify their email address.\nThe user's sign-in on the desktop browser gets an error, because the link was verified on a different device and browser.\nPhone\n\nWarning\n\nThis feature requires a paid plan⁠ for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the pricing⁠ page for more information.\n\nUsers can authenticate with their phone number and verify it with an OTP⁠.\n\nSMS functionality is restricted to phone numbers from countries enabled on your SMS allowlist.\n\nSMS allowlist\n\nSMS functionality, including SMS OTPs⁠, is restricted to phone numbers from countries that are enabled on your SMS allowlist. This can be useful for avoiding extraneous SMS fees from countries from which your app is not expected to attract traffic. By default, only the US and Canada are enabled.\n\nEvery instance starts off with a default set of enabled SMS country tiers. To tailor it to your needs:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SMS⁠ page.\nSelect the Settings tab.\nEnable or disable countries as needed.\n\nIf a country is disabled, then phone numbers starting with the corresponding country calling code:\n\nCannot receive OTPs⁠ and a request to receive an OTP will be rejected with an error\nCannot receive notifications for password or passkey modifications\nCannot be used upon sign-up\nCannot be added to an existing user profile\nUsername\n\nIn this section, you can allow users to set their username. Usernames must be between 4 and 64 characters long and do not allow special characters (^$!.#+~), but this can be customized.\n\nImportant\n\nUsernames only support Latin-based characters. This restriction helps protect against Unicode spoofing and homograph attacks, where characters from non-Latin scripts can be used to impersonate users.\n\nPassword\n\nWhen Password is enabled, users provide a password to sign in.\n\nDisabling Password will only affect new users. Existing users will still be able to sign in with their existing password.\n\nPasskeys\n\nWarning\n\nThis feature requires a paid plan⁠ for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the pricing⁠ page for more information.\n\nA passkey is a type of sign-in credential that requires one user action, but uses two authentication factors:\n\nA pin number or biometric data\nA physical device\n\nUsers can only create passkeys after signing up, so you'll need to enable another authentication strategy for the sign-up process. After signing in, users can create a passkey.\n\nNote\n\nWhen setting up passkeys with Android or Expo, there are a few additional steps to follow:\n\nSet up passkeys for Android\n.\nSet up passkeys for Expo\n.\nPasskey limitations\nPasskeys are not currently available as an MFA option.\nNot all devices and browsers are compatible with passkeys. Passkeys are built on WebAuthn technology and you should check the Browser Compatibility docs⁠ for an up-to-date list.\nPasskey related APIs will not work with Expo.\nYour users can have a max of 10 passkeys per account.\nDomain restrictions for passkeys\n\nPasskeys are tied to the domain they are created on and cannot be used across different domains. However, passkeys do work on subdomains if they are registered on the root domain. For example:\n\nPasskeys created on your-domain.com cannot be used on your-domain-admin.com (different domains).\nPasskeys created on your-domain.com can be used on accounts.your-domain.com (subdomain of the same root domain).\nPasskeys created on staging1.your-domain.com cannot be used on staging2.your-domain.com (sibling subdomains) unless the passkey was scoped to your-domain.com (i.e. the shared root domain).\n\nIf you're using satellite domains, in both development and production, passkeys won't be portable between your primary domain and your satellite domains so you should avoid using them.\n\nIf you're not using satellite domains:\n\nIn development, you can either:\n\nThe recommended approach. Use Clerk's \ncomponents\n, Elements, or custom flows⁠, instead of the Account Portal. This ensures the passkey is created and used entirely on your development domain, so passkeys created on localhost will only work on localhost.\nCreate a passkey directly through the Account Portal instead of your local application to keep it tied to the Account Portal's domain. Passkeys created on your Account Portal (e.g., your-app.accounts.dev) will only work on that domain, which can cause issues if you switch between localhost and the Account Portal during development. If you choose this approach, ensure all testing happens on the same domain where the passkey was created.\n\nIn production, your Account Portal is usually hosted on a subdomain of your main domain (e.g. accounts.your-domain.com), enabling passkeys to work seamlessly across your app. However, as stated above, if you use satellite domains, passkeys will not work as intended.\n\nUser model\n\nIn this section, you can:\n\nAllow users to set their first and last name.\nAllow users to delete their accounts.\nSSO connections\n\nSSO connections are a way to allow users to authenticate with their existing accounts from other services. For example, if a user already has an account with Google, they can sign in with their Google account instead of creating a new account with your application.\n\nClerk offers two different types of SSO connections:\n\nFor all users, which are also known as OAuth connections, or social connections. Read more about OAuth connections.\nFor specific domains and Organizations, which are also known as Enterprise SSO connections. Read more about Enterprise SSO connections.\n\nTo enable SSO connections, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nWeb3 authentication\n\nClerk provides Web3 authentication with either Base, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or OKX Wallet. As part of validating the accuracy of the returned Web3 account address, Clerk handles the signing of a message and verifying the signature. Because sign-in with Web3 uses the same abstraction as our other authentication factors, like passwords or email links, other Clerk features like multi-factor authentication and profile enrichment work for Web3 users out-of-the-box.\n\nTo enable Web3 authentication, navigate to the Web3⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nMulti-factor authentication\n\nClerk supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), also known as two-factor authentication (2FA). If a user enables MFA for their account, they are required to complete a second verification step during sign-in. This enhances security by enforcing two different types of verification. Many websites offer this as an optional step, giving users control over their own security.\n\nMFA is not available on the new application screen, but it can be enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Multi-factor⁠ page.\nToggle on the MFA strategies you would like to enable.\n\nThe following MFA strategies are currently available:\n\nSMS verification code\nAuthenticator application (also known as TOTP - Time-based One-time Password)\nBackup codes\n\nEnabling MFA allows users of your app to turn it on for their own accounts through their User Profile page. Enabling MFA does not automatically turn on MFA for all users.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you're using Duo as an authenticator app, please note that Duo generates TOTP codes differently than other authenticator apps. Duo allows a code to be valid for 30 seconds from the moment it is first displayed, which may cause frequent invalid_code errors if the code is not entered promptly. More information can be found in Duo's Help Center⁠.\n\nIf you're building a custom user interface instead of using the Account Portal or \nprebuilt components\n, you can use elements or the Clerk API to build a custom sign-in flow that allows users to sign in with MFA.\n\nReset a user's MFA\n\nYou can reset a user's MFA by deleting their MFA enrollments. This will remove all of their MFA methods and they will have to enroll in MFA again.\n\nTo reset a user's MFA:\n\nAt the top of the Clerk Dashboard⁠, select Users.\nSelect the user from the list.\nSelect the Reset MFA enrollments button.\nRestrictions\n\nClerk provides a set of restriction options designed to provide you with enhanced control over who can gain access to your application. Restrictions can limit sign-ups or prevent accounts with specific identifiers, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and even entire domains, from accessing your application. Learn more about restrictions.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To configure Sign in with Apple on native applications (such as iOS or Expo apps), see the \ndedicated guide\n.\n\nConfigure for your development instance\n\nFor development instances, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs.\n\nTo configure your development instance, follow these steps:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect Add connection and select For all users.\nSelect Apple from the provider list.\nConfigure for your production instance\n\nFor production instances, you must provide custom credentials.\n\nYou must generate and provide your own Apple Services ID, Apple Private Key, Apple Team ID, and Apple Key ID using your Apple Developer account.\n\nTo make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your Clerk Dashboard⁠ and one for your Apple Developer dashboard⁠.\n\nEnable Apple as a social connection\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect Add connection and select For all users.\nSelect Apple from the provider list.\nEnsure that both Enable for sign-up and sign-in and Use custom credentials are toggled on.\nSave the Email Source for Apple Private Email Relay and Return URL values somewhere secure, as you'll need to provide them to Apple later. Keep this page open.\nGet your Apple Team ID\n\nTo get your Apple Team ID, create a new App ID in the Apple Developer portal by following these steps:\n\nOn a separate page, navigate to the Apple Developer dashboard⁠.\nUnder Certificates, IDs and Profiles, select Identifiers⁠.\nIn the top-right, select the dropdown and select App IDs.\nNext to Identifiers at the top of the page, select the plus icon (+) to register a new identifier. You'll be redirected to the Register a new identifier page.\nSelect App IDs, then select Continue.\nOn the next page, you'll be prompted to Select a type for your app. Choose App and select Continue. You will be redirected to the Register an App ID page.\nFill in a description for your App ID and a Bundle ID. Under Capabilities, ensure that Sign In with Apple is enabled. Then select Continue. You'll be redirected to the Confirm your App ID page.\nAt the top of the page, you'll see your App ID Prefix. Save this value somewhere secure. This is your Apple Team ID in Clerk.\nFinally, select Register. You'll be redirected to the Identifiers page.\nGet your Apple Services ID\n\nTo get your Apple Services ID, create a new Services ID in the Apple Developer portal.\n\nOn the Identifiers page, in the dropdown near the top-right of the page, select the Services IDs option from the list.\nNext to Identifiers at the top of the page, select the plus icon (+) to register a new identifier. You'll be redirected to the Register a new identifier page.\nSelect Services IDs, then select Continue. You'll be redirected to the Register a Services ID page.\nAdd a description for your Services ID, and set an Identifier. Save the Identifier value somewhere secure. This is your Apple Services ID in Clerk. Finally, select Continue.\nIn the confirmation view, select Register.\nAfter the registration is finished, select the newly-created Services ID. Ensure the Sign In with Apple box is enabled and select Configure.\nUnder Primary App ID, select the App ID you created in the previous step.\nUnder Domains and Subdomains, add your Clerk Frontend API URL⁠ without the protocol. For example, if your domain is https://myapp.com, then your Frontend API URL is https://clerk.myapp.com, and you would add clerk.myapp.com to Domains and Subdomains.\nUnder Return URLS, add the Return URL value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.\nSelect Next. You'll be redirected to the Confirm your web authentication configuration screen.\nSelect Done. You'll be redirected to the Edit your Services ID Configuration page.\nSelect Continue. You'll be redirected to the confirmation page.\nSelect Save. You'll be redirected to the Identifiers page.\nGet your Apple Private Key and Key ID\n\nTo get your Apple Private Key and Key ID, create a new Key in the Apple Developer portal.\n\nOn the Identifiers page, in the sidenav, select Keys.\nNext to Keys at the top of the page, select the plus icon (+) to register a new key. You'll be redirected to the Register a New Key page.\nAdd a Key Name and ensure the Sign In with Apple box is enabled and select Configure. You'll be redirected to the Configure Key page.\nUnder Primary App ID, select the App ID you created in the first step of this guide. Then select Save. You'll be redirected to the previous Register a New Key page.\nSelect Continue and you'll be presented with the final confirmation screen. Verify that Sign in with Apple is checked. Select Register. You'll be redirected to the Download Your Key page.\nSave the Key ID value somewhere secure. This is your Apple Key ID in Clerk.\nDownload the private key file. This is your Apple Private Key in Clerk. Ensure you back up the key in a secure location, as it cannot be downloaded again later.\nSelect Done. You'll be redirected to the Keys page.\nConfigure Email Source for Apple Private Relay\n\nNote\n\nIn some regions (such as China and India), Apple IDs may not include an email address at all, and instead are tied only to a phone number. If your instance requires all users to have an email, Sign in with Apple may fail for these users. Depending on your user base, you may want to navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard and disable the Sign-up with email setting.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about this, see the Apple documentation⁠.\n\nApple provides a privacy feature called Hide My Email⁠, allowing users to sign in to your app with Apple without disclosing their actual email addresses. Instead, your instance receives an app-specific email address that forwards any emails to the user real's address.\n\nTo be able to send emails properly to users with hidden addresses, you must configure an additional setting in the Apple Developer portal.\n\nIn the sidenav of the Apple Developer Portal, select Services⁠.\nUnder Sign in with Apple for Email Communication, select Configure. You'll be redirected to the Configure Sign in with Apple for Email Communication page.\nNext to Email Sources at the top of the page, select the plus icon (+) to add a new Email Source.\nIn the Register your email sources modal that opens, under Email Addresses, add the Email Source for Apple Private Email Relay value that you copied from the Apple SSO custom credentials⁠ in the Clerk Dashboard. It should look something like this: bounces+00000000@clkmail.myapp.com.\nSelect Next. The modal will redirect to the Confirm your email sources screen.\nSelect Register. The modal will redirect to the Email Source Registration Complete screen.\nSelect Done.\n\nAfter this step, the email address should appear in the list and display a green check icon, indicating it has been verified. If it's not marked as verified yet, DNS propagation may still be in progress. Wait for the propagation to complete before attempting to select Reverify SPF.\n\nFor more info about Apple's Private Relay service, refer to the following documentation:\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425#hideemail⁠\nhttps://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-private-email-relay-service⁠\nConnect your Apple app to your Clerk app\n\nBy now, you should have the following values saved from the Apple Developer portal:\n\nApple Team ID\nApple Services ID\nApple Key ID\nApple Private Key file\n\nConnect your Apple app to your Clerk app by adding these values to the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nNavigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the configuration page should still be open.\nAdd all the corresponding fields depending on your desired flow. For the Apple Private Key file, open it with a text editor and copy/paste the contents. You must include the -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END PRIVATE KEY----- lines.\nSelect Save.\nTest your connection\n\nThe simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's Account Portal, which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Account Portal⁠ page.\nNext to Sign-in, select the button to visit the sign-in page. The URL should resemble:\nFor development - https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in\nFor production - https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in\nSign in with your connection's credentials.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This guide walks you through the steps to set up a custom OAuth provider.\n\nConfiguration\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect Add connection and select For all users.\nSelect the Custom provider tab.\nFill in the following fields:\nName: The provider name (visible to users)\nKey: A unique identifier for the provider (cannot be changed after creation)\nDiscovery Endpoint: The OIDC discovery endpoint URL of your provider\nAlternatively, select Manual configuration to set up provider endpoints manually\nClient ID: Obtained from your provider\nClient Secret: Obtained from your provider\nSelect Add connection. You will be redirected to the connection's configuration page.\n\nThe provider is now configured but not yet enabled. On the connection's configuration page, find the Authorized redirect URLs to configure in your provider's settings.\n\nEnable the provider from the top of the details page when ready.\n\nAttribute mapping\n\nIf your provider returns claims in a non-standard format:\n\nGo to the provider's details page.\nUnder Attribute mapping, configure the mapping to match your provider's claim format.\nTips\nFor fields like Email address verified, set default values for missing claims.\nIf the provider returns a claim but you don't want to set it, leave the mapping field empty.\nIf you set a user info URL, it takes priority over the ID Token for claim retrieval.\nHandling edge cases\n\nSometimes attribute mapping isn't enough to get a provider working. For example, the call to the User info URL might require additional credentials or API calls. In these instances you should implement a proxy between Clerk and the provider to handle these transformations. The proxy will then be set as the User info URL.\n\nThe proxy receives the request from Clerk (which contains an Authorization header) and should return a JSON object which you can use for attribute mapping.\n\nExample: Hono with Cloudflare Workers\n\nInitialize a new Hono + Cloudflare Workers⁠ project\n\nImplement your proxy logic, e.g. making an additional API call. Here's a minimal example:\n\nsrc/index.ts\nimport { Hono } from 'hono'\n\nconst app = new Hono()\n\napp.get('/', async (c) => {\n  const authorization = c.req.header('authorization')\n\n  const userRes = await fetch('https://api.com/user', {\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      Authorization: authorization,\n      'api-key': 'some-api-key',\n    },\n  })\n\n  const user = await userRes.json()\n\n  return c.json({\n    uuid: user.uuid,\n    avatar_url: user.avatar,\n    name: user.name,\n    username: user.username,\n    slug: user.id.slug,\n  })\n})\n\nexport default app\n\nDeploy your proxy\n\nSet the URL of the deployed Cloudflare worker as the User info URL\n\nMap the returned claim format of the proxy to the respective attributes in the Attribute mapping section\n\nReferences\nOpenID Connect Specification⁠\nOAuth 2.0 Framework⁠\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The URL should resemble:\nFor development - https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in\nFor production - https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in\nSign in with your connection's credentials.\n\nWarning\n\nGoogle sign-in does not allow users to sign in via in-app browsers⁠.\n\nImportant note about switching to production\n\nGoogle OAuth apps have a publishing status that determines who can access the app. The publishing status setting can be found in the Google Cloud Platform console on the APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen page. You can only view the publishing status if the User type is set to External.\n\nBy default, Google OAuth apps are set to the \"Testing\" publishing status⁠, which is intended for internal testing before opening connections to your intended audience⁠. It's limited to 100 test users and depending on the requested OAuth scopes, they might need to be explicitly added to your trusted user list to be able to connect.\n\nTo switch a Google OAuth app to production, you must set the publishing status to \"In production\". This involves a verification process with regard to your app name, logo, and scopes requested before Google accepts the switch to production.\n\nEnsure that your Clerk production app always uses a corresponding Google OAuth app that is set to the \"In production\" publishing status, so your end users don't encounter any issues using Google as a social connection.\n\nBlock email subaddresses\n\nBy default, your app will block any Google account with an email address that contains the characters +, = or # from being able to sign up, sign in, or be added to existing accounts.\n\nFor a Google organization with the domain example.com, blocking email subaddresses prevents someone with access to user@example.com from signing up with user+alias@example.com. This is a known Google OAuth vulnerability⁠ that could allow unauthorized, as Google organization administrators cannot suspend or delete the email alias account. It's recommended to keep this setting enabled for enhanced security.\n\nTo configure this setting:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect the Google connection.\nEnable or disable Block email subaddresses.\n\nNote\n\nExisting Google accounts with email subaddresses will be blocked by this restriction and won't be able to sign in.\n\nGoogle One Tap\n\nGoogle One Tap⁠ enables users to sign up or sign in to your Clerk app with the press of a button. After adding Google to your Clerk app as a social connection, you can use the prebuilt <GoogleOneTap /> component to render the One Tap UI in your app. See \nthe <GoogleOneTap /> component reference\n to learn more.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Under Projects, you'll see an automatically generated app with a randomly generated string as its name.\n\nIf you want to create a new X/Twitter application, follow these steps:\n\nIn the X/Twitter Developer Portal, under Projects⁠, select Add App. You'll be redirected to the App name tab. If you have a Free account, you can only have one app at a time, so you'll need to delete the existing app before being able to create a new one.\nEnter your application name and select Next. You'll be redirected to the Keys & Tokens tab where your app's credentials are displayed. However, these credentials aren't needed to set up the X/Twitter social connection with Clerk, as the setup uses the OAuth 2.0 flow, which relies on different credentials.\nSelect App settings.

Will my users be deleted?\nDoes Clerk support IdP-initiated SSO?\nHow much does it cost?\nCopy as markdown\nOpen\n\nEnterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to sign in seamlessly using their Identity Provider (IdP) credentials (e.g.,Azure AD, Okta, or Google Workspace) and have their user data synchronized with Clerk. Clerk supports multiple protocols for implementing Enterprise SSO, including SAML and OIDC. Learn more about the process in the guides on authentication flows and account linking.\n\nSAML\n\nClerk supports Enterprise SSO via the SAML protocol, enabling you to create authentication strategies for an IdP. The following IdPs are supported: Microsoft Azure AD, Google Workspace, and Okta Workforce. However, you can also integrate with any other IdP that supports the SAML protocol.\n\nAllow subdomains\n\nAuthenticating via SAML SSO requires the user's email address domain to match the exact domain the SAML connection has been configured with. By default, subdomains are not supported. For example, a user with the email address john@sales.example.com wouldn't be able to use a SAML connection with the example.com domain to authenticate.\n\nTo configure subdomains for a SAML connection:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect the SAML connection you want to allow subdomains for.\nSelect the Advanced tab.\nEnable or disable the Allow subdomains option.\nSelect Save.\n\nNote\n\nTo enable the Allow subdomains option, your SAML connection domain must be an eTLD+1⁠.\n\nNative applications\n\nClerk ensures that security critical nonces are passed only to allowlisted URLs when the SSO flow is completed in native browsers or webviews. For maximum security in your production instances, you need to allowlist your custom redirect URLs via the Clerk Dashboard⁠ or the Clerk Backend API.\n\nTo allowlist a redirect URL via the Clerk Dashboard:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Native applications⁠ page.\nScroll down to the Allowlist for mobile SSO redirect section and add your redirect URLs.\n\nNote\n\nBy default, Clerk uses {bundleIdentifier}://callback as the redirect URL.\n\nOIDC\n\nClerk supports Enterprise SSO via the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, either through EASIE or by integrating with any OIDC-compatible provider.\n\nEASIE\n\nEASIE⁠ SSO is a way for applications to provide enterprise-grade SSO through a multi-tenant OpenID provider. It is designed to be an easier alternative to SAML SSO.\n\nThe following IdPs are supported: Google Workspace and Microsoft Entra ID. For development instances, Clerk uses preconfigured shared credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed. For production instances, you must provide custom credentials. Follow the steps outlined in the guides to complete the setup:\n\nGoogle\nMicrosoft\nAutomatic deprovisioning\n\nClerk prevents users linked to deprovisioned accounts in the OpenID provider from accessing the app.\n\nBefore creating a new session token for an EASIE user, Clerk verifies whether the user has been deprovisioned from their OpenID provider (e.g., suspended⁠ or deleted⁠ in Google Workspace, or deleted⁠ in Microsoft Entra). This verification process might involve a delay of up to 10 minutes. If deprovisioning is detected, Clerk revokes that user's existing sessions and responds to any requests for a new session token with a 401 Unauthorized error.\n\nIt is ultimately the app's responsibility to handle this unauthenticated state and display something appropriate to the user. For example, Next.js apps using \nauth.protect()\n will automatically redirect the user to the sign-in page.\n\nSAML vs. EASIE\n\nThe primary security difference between EASIE SSO and SAML SSO is that EASIE depends on a multi-tenant identity provider, while SAML depends on a single-tenant identity provider. Relying on a multi-tenant provider increases the risk that a user from one tenant will mistakenly be granted access to the resources of another tenant. While Clerk implements measures to address this risk⁠, apps that require single-tenant IdPs should opt for SAML.\n\nFor more information, see the EASIE docs⁠.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\nCan I use multiple identifiers or authentication methods with enterprise connections?\n\nYes, multiple identifiers (such as email, username, or other attributes) can be configured and used for SAML and OIDC connections. However, for EASIE connections, there can only be one identifier or authentication method.\n\nBy default, additional identifiers are disabled for new connections. To enable multiple identifiers for a SAML or OIDC connection:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect the enterprise connection you want to allow multiple identifiers for.\nSelect the Advanced tab.\nEnable the Allow additional identifiers option.\nSelect Save.\nWill Enterprise SSO work for my existing users?\n\nYes, Enterprise SSO will work for your existing users as well! If you enable SAML or EASIE, any existing users with an email address that matches the SAML or EASIE connection domain will have to authenticate on the IdP side and an Enterprise account will be linked to their existing account.\n\nWhat happens if I have multi-factor enabled at Clerk?\n\nOnce the user returns from the IdP, they will need to complete additional authentication factors. This is useful if you want to add extra factors beyond what your IdP supports or if your IdP doesn’t support them. This feature is optional and can be disabled if not needed.\n\nWhat happens if I delete the Enterprise Connection? Will my users be deleted?\n\nThe users will not be deleted, so your app will not break. However, they will need to use another sign-in option such as password or email codes to authenticate themselves moving forward.\n\nDoes Clerk support IdP-initiated SSO?\n\nYes, for SAML only. Clerk supports both Service Provider-initiated (SP-initiated) and Identity Provider-initiated (IdP-initiated) SSO flows. For more information, see the authentication flows guide.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nFor development instances, Enterprise connections are always free but limited to a maximum of 25.\n\nProduction instances require the Pro or Business plan. Please see pricing⁠ for more information.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The default is 6 months, and the maximum is 24 months. When your secret expires, your social connection will stop working until you generate a new secret. It's recommended to set a reminder before the expiration date to avoid disruption to your sign-in flow.\n\nSelect Add.\nSave the Value somewhere secure.\nEnable OpenID\nIn the left sidenav, open the Manage dropdown and select Authentication.\nIn the Front-channel logout URL field, paste the Redirect URI you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.\nUnder Implicit grant and hybrid flows, check both Access tokens and ID tokens.\nSelect Save to save the changes.\nSecure your app against the nOAuth vulnerability\n\nnOAuth⁠ is an exploit in Microsoft Entra ID OAuth apps that can lead to account takeovers via email address spoofing. Clerk mitigates this risk by enforcing stricter checks on verified email addresses.\n\nFor further security, Microsoft offers an optional xms_edov claim⁠, which provides additional context to determine whether the returned email is verified.\n\nImportant\n\nWhen adding the xms_edov claim in the Azure portal, you may see a warning saying it's invalid or not recognized. You can safely ignore this warning - xms_edov is fully supported and documented by Microsoft Entra ID for stronger email domain verification, but the Azure portal's token configuration UI may not recognize it yet.\n\nTo enable it, you must:\n\nIn the left sidenav, in the Manage dropdown, select Token configuration.\nSelect Add optional claim.\nFor the Token type, select ID. Then, in the table that opens, enable the email and xms_pdl claims.\nAt the bottom of the modal, select Add. A new modal will prompt you to turn on the Microsoft Graph email permission. Enable it, then select Add to complete the form.\nRepeat the previous steps but for Token type, select Access instead of ID. The Optional claims list should now show two claims for email and two for xms_pdl: one each for ID and Access.\nIn the left sidenav, in the Manage dropdown, select Manifest.\nIn the text editor, search for \"acceptMappedClaims\" and set its value from null to true.\nSearch for \"optionalClaims\", where you'll find the idToken and accessToken arrays. Each array has an object with the name xms_pdl. Change the name to xms_edov.\nAt the top of the page, select Save.\nIn the left sidenav, in the Manage dropdown, select Token configuration to confirm that the Optional claims list includes two claims for email and two for xms_edov: one each for ID and Access.\n\nWith these steps complete, Microsoft will send the xms_edov claim in the token, which Clerk will use to determine whether the email is verified, even when used with Microsoft Entra ID.\n\nSet the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard\nNavigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the configuration page should still be open. Paste the Client ID and Client Secret values that you saved into the respective fields.\nSelect Save.\n\nNote\n\nIf the page is no longer open, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under Use custom credentials, paste the values into their respective fields.\n\nTest your connection\n\nThe simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's Account Portal, which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Account Portal⁠ page.\nNext to Sign-in, select the button to visit the sign-in page. The URL should resemble:\nFor development - https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in\nFor production - https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in\nSign in with your connection's credentials.\nLimitations\nCurrently, Clerk supports only the common tenant type, which allows sign-ins both from organization members and public Microsoft users.\nThe option to selecting the desired tenant type (common, organizations, consumers or specific tenant ID) will be available in an upcoming version of Clerk.\nOnly credentials of type secret are supported (not the certificate type).\n\nTip\n\nIf you're using SAML with Microsoft, the different tenant types are supported, and you can disregard these limitations.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

If you decide to enable IdP-initiated flows, ensure that proper security measures, such as MFA and short validation periods, are in place to mitigate the associated risks.\n\nService Provider-initiated flow (recommended)\n\nIn an SP-initiated flow:\n\nThe user starts the authentication process from your application (Service Provider, or SP), by providing their email address.\nThe user is redirected to the SAML provider (Identity Provider, or IdP) where they must authenticate.\nAfter successful authentication, the user is redirected back to your app, gaining access to their account.\nIdentity Provider-initiated flow\n\nIn an IdP-initiated flow:\n\nThe user starts the authentication flow from the SAML provider (IdP) by selecting which app (SP) they want to access.\nThe user is redirected to the app of their choice, gaining access to their account.\n\nNote\n\nIdP-Initiated flow carries a security risk. It is recommended to use an SP-Initiated flow whenever possible.\n\nTo allow IdP-initiated flows for your SAML connection:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect Add connection and select For specific domains or organizations.\nSelect your Identity Provider. Complete the fields and select Add connection. You'll be redirected to the SAML connection's configuration page.\nSelect the Advanced tab.\nIn Advanced Settings, enable Allow IdP-Initiated flow. A modal will open. Select Enable to confirm.\nSelect Save.\nRisks of IdP-initiated flow\n\nWhile IdP-initiated flows might offer convenience, they are also susceptible to security risks, such as meddler-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks⁠. A bad actor might hijack the IdP response to gain access to a compromised account.\n\nWhen enabling an IdP-initiated flow, it's possible for Clerk to receive unsolicited authentication requests, which neither the SP nor IdP can verify were initiated by the specified user. Additionally, a bad actor could intercept the IdP response and replace it, performing a CSRF attack to sign in as the attacker.\n\nClerk's security measures\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with IdP-initiated flows, Clerk implements several security measures:\n\nUnsolicited InResponseTo attribute: Clerk ensures that unsolicited responses don't contain an InResponseTo attribute, in accordance with the SAML 2.0 profiles specification⁠. This prevents bad actors from stealing a response used in an SP-initiated flow and using it in an IdP-initiated flow.\nReplay detection: Clerk consumes and remembers each response to prevent re-use. This ensures that bad actors cannot steal and reuse a response to gain access to a user's account.\nMulti-factor authentication: Clerk supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SAML IdP-initiated flows. MFA requires users to provide two or more forms of verification, which significantly enhances security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nUse small validation periods: Each SAML response contains a timestamp indicating when it was issued and when it will expire. Since IdP-initiated flows are expected to be completed within seconds, validation periods must be as small as possible to prevent attacks. Common IdP providers such as Azure, Google, and Okta handle this by default. However, if you're using a custom IdP, you must ensure that the validation periods are set correctly.\nOIDC\n\nClerk supports Enterprise SSO via the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, either through EASIE or by integrating with any OIDC-compatible provider.\n\nEASIE\n\nEASIE connections support the authentication flows described at easie.dev⁠.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

It enables seamless sign-in using Enterprise SSO alongside other authentication methods like username/password. Clerk automatically attempts to link accounts that share the same email address, assuming a single owner for each email.\n\nHow it works\n\nWhen a user attempts to sign in or up, Clerk checks if the email address from the Identity Provider (IdP) matches an existing account and attempts to link them. Email addresses from IdPs are considered verified by default.\n\nThe following sections explain the different scenarios that can occur during this process and how Clerk handles each one.\n\nEmail is verified in Clerk\n\nWhen a user signs into your app using an IdP that returns a matching verified email address, Clerk automatically links the Enterprise SSO account to the existing account and completes the sign-in process. This includes accounts protected by passwords, as the Enterprise SSO sign-in flow automatically bypasses password verification.\n\nEmail is not verified and verification isn't required\n\nBy default, Clerk requires email verification at sign-up. For instances that have disabled this behavior, there's a possibility that an account may be created using an unverified email address.\n\nTo configure email verification at sign-up:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page.\nUnder Email, ensure Verify at sign-up is enabled.\n\nWhen a user signs into your app using an IdP, Clerk automatically links the Enterprise SSO account to the existing account by also verifying the existing email address and signing the user in. This includes accounts protected by passwords, as the Enterprise SSO sign-in flow automatically bypasses password verification.\n\nEmail is not verified\n\nWhen a user signs into your app using an IdP that returns a matching unverified email address, Clerk doesn't link the Enterprise SSO account to the existing account, but instead signs the user up and creates a completely new account.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

It requires that a SAML connection is configured in both the Clerk Dashboard and Microsoft Entra ID. This guide assumes that you have access to the Clerk app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard. The \"customer\" in this case is whoever has access to the Microsoft Entra ID settings.\n\nCreate a Microsoft Entra ID SAML connection in Clerk\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect Add connection and select For specific domains or organizations.\nUnder SAML, select Microsoft Entra ID (Formerly AD).\nEnter the Domain. This is the email domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application. Optionally, select an Organization.\nEnter the Name. This will be displayed on the sign-in form.\nSelect Add connection. You'll be redirected to the connection's configuration page. Note that the connection is disabled by default.\nIn the Service Provider Configuration section, save the Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL) and Identifier (Entity ID) values somewhere secure. You'll need to give these to the customer so they can configure their Microsoft Entra ID application.\nConfigure SAML application\n\nNow that the enterprise connection is configured in Clerk and the Reply URL and Identifier are known, the customer's Microsoft application needs to be configured. At a high level, the process is:\n\nCreate a new enterprise app in Microsoft Azure.\nAssign selected users or groups to that Microsoft application.\nAdd the Reply URL and Identifier from Clerk to the Microsoft application's SAML configuration.\nVerify that the attribute mappings are correct.\nObtain and share the application's metadata URL.\n\nYou are welcome to use the below email template with detailed instructions. They contain the following template strings that you should replace with your actual values:\n\n[YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME]\n[YOUR_CLERK_ENTITY_ID]\n[YOUR_CLERK_REPLY_URL]\n\nHere are the instructions for setting up SAML SSO with Microsoft Entra ID:\n\nStep 1: Create a new enterprise application in Microsoft\n\nNavigate to the Microsoft Azure portal⁠ and sign in.\nUnder the Azure Services section, find and select Enterprise applications. You may have to go to the All services⁠ page and then scroll down to the Identity section to find it.\nSelect New application. You'll be redirected to the Browse Microsoft Entra Gallery page.\nSelect Create your own application.\nIn the modal that opens:\nName of your application (likely [YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME]).\nSelect Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery).\nSelect Create.\n\nStep 2: Assign your users or groups in Microsoft\n\nNow that you have created the enterprise app, you need to assign users or groups before they can use it to log in. Below are instructions for assigning an individual user, but for more options and instructions for groups, see Microsoft's docs here⁠.\n\nIn the Getting Started section, select the Assign users and groups link.\nSelect Add user/group. You'll be redirected to the Add Assignment page.\nSelect the None Selected link.\nTo assign a user to the enterprise app, you can either use the search field to find a user or select the checkbox next to the user in the table.\nSelect Select at the bottom of the page. You'll be redirected to the Add Assignment page.\nSelect Assign at the bottom of the page.\n\nStep 3: Set Basic SAML Configuration\n\nIn the navigation sidenav, open the Manage dropdown and select Single sign-on.\nIn the Select a single sign-on method section, select SAML. You'll be redirected to the Set up Single Sign-On with SAML page.\nFind the Basic SAML Configuration section.\nSelect Edit. The Basic SAML Configuration panel will open.\nAdd the following Identifier (Entity ID) and Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL) values. These values will be saved automatically.\nIdentifier (Entity ID): [YOUR_CLERK_ENTITY_ID]\nReply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL): [YOUR_CLERK_REPLY_URL]\nSelect Save at the top of the panel. Close the panel.\n\nStep 4: Verify correct configuration of attributes and claims\n\nWe expect your SAML responses to have the following specific attributes:\n\nEmail address (required). This is the email address that your users will use to authenticate into your app:\n\nClaim name: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress\nValue: user.mail\n\nFirst name (optional):\n\nClaim name: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname\nValue: user.givenname\n\nLast name (optional):\n\nClaim name: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname\nValue: user.surname\n\nThese are the defaults, and probably won't need you to change them. However, many SAML configuration errors are due to incorrect attribute mappings, so it's worth double-checking. Here's how:\n\nStill on the Set up Single Sign-On with SAML page, find the Attributes & Claims section.\nSelect Edit.\nVerify that the above three attributes and values are present.\n\nStep 5: Share the application's metadata URL\n\nStill on the Set up Single Sign-On with SAML page, find the SAML Certificates section.\nCopy the App Federation Metadata Url, and reply to this email with it. This is the final piece of information we need to enable SAML.\nAdd App Federation Metadata URL in the Clerk Dashboard\n\nAfter following the instructions in the email, your customer should have sent you the Microsoft app's App Federation Metadata URL. Now, you're going to add it to the Clerk connection, completing the SAML connection configuration.\n\nNavigate to the SSO connections⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nSelect the SAML connection.\nIn the Identity Provider Configuration section, under App Federation Metadata Url, paste the App Federation Metadata URL.\nSelect Fetch & save. Keep the page open for the next step.\nEnable the connection in Clerk\n\nThe SAML connection is ready to enable! Once enabled, all users with email addresses ending in the domain will be redirected to Microsoft at sign-up and sign-in.\n\nWarning\n\nIf there are existing users with email domains that match the SAML connection, and there is an error in the SAML configuration in Clerk or Microsoft, those users will be unable to sign in when the connection is enabled. If this is a concern, we recommend coordinating with your counterpart to test the connection at an off-peak time.\n\nTo make the connection available for users to authenticate with:\n\nNavigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where you should still have the connection's configuration page open. If not, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page and select the connection.\nAt the top of the page, toggle on Enable connection and select Save.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

It requires that a SAML connection is configured in both the Clerk Dashboard and Okta. This guide assumes that you have access to the Clerk app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard. The \"customer\" in this case is whoever has access to the Okta Workforce's app settings.\n\nCreate an Okta SAML connection in Clerk\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect Add connection and select For specific domains or organizations.\nUnder SAML, select Okta Workforce.\nEnter the Domain. This is the email domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your app. Optionally, select an Organization.\nEnter the Name. This will be displayed on the sign-in form.\nSelect Add connection. You'll be redirected to the connection's configuration page. Note that the connection is disabled by default.\nIn the Service Provider Configuration section, save the Single sign-on URL and Audience URI (SP Entity ID) values somewhere secure. You'll need to give these to the customer so they can configure their Okta app.\nConfigure SAML app\n\nNow that the enterprise connection is configured in Clerk and the Single sign-on URL and Audience URI (SP Entity ID) are known, the customer's Okta app needs to be configured. At a high level, the process is:\n\nCreate a new enterprise app in Okta.\nAdd the Single sign-on URL and Audience URI (SP Entity ID) from Clerk to the Okta app's SAML configuration.\nVerify that the attribute mappings are correct.\nAssign selected users or groups to the app.\nObtain and share the app's Metadata URL.\n\nTo get you started, you can use the following email template with detailed instructions:\n\nHere are the instructions for setting up SAML SSO with Okta Workforce:\n\nStep 1: Create a new enterprise app in Okta\n\nNavigate to Okta⁠ and sign in.\nIn the Okta dashboard, select Admin in the top right corner.\nIn the navigation sidenav, select the Applications dropdown and select Applications.\nSelect Create App Integration.\nIn the Create a new app integration modal, select the SAML 2.0 option and select the Next button.\nOnce redirected to the Create SAML Integration page, complete the General Settings fields. An App name is required.\nSelect Next. You'll be redirected to the Configure SAML page.\nPaste the Single sign-on URL and the Audience URI (SP Entity ID) values that you saved from the Clerk Dashboard into their respective fields.\n\nStep 2: Verify correct configuration of attributes and claims\n\nWe expect your SAML responses to have the following specific attributes:\n\nEmail address (required). This is the email address that your users will use to authenticate into your app:\nClaim name: user.email\nFirst name (optional):\nClaim name: user.firstName\nLast name (optional):\nClaim name: user.lastName\n\nThese are the defaults, and probably won't need you to change them. However, many SAML configuration errors are due to incorrect attribute mappings, so it's worth double-checking. Here's how:\n\nIn the Okta dashboard, find the Attribute Statements (optional) section.\nFor the Name field, enter mail.\nFor the Value field, choose user.email from the dropdown.\nSelect the Add Another button to add another attribute.\nFor the Name field, enter firstName.\nFor the Value field, choose user.firstName from the dropdown.\nSelect the Add Another button to add another attribute.\nFor the Name field, enter lastName.\nFor the Value field, choose user.lastName from the dropdown.\nScroll to the bottom of the page and select the Next button to continue.\nYou will be redirected to the Feedback page. Fill out the feedback however you would like and select the Finish button to complete the setup.\n\nStep 3: Assign selected user or group in Okta\n\nYou need to assign users or groups to your enterprise app before they can use it to sign in.\n\nIn the Okta dashboard, select the Assignments tab.\nSelect the Assign dropdown. You can either select Assign to people or Assign to groups.\nIn the search field, enter the user or group of users that you want to assign to the enterprise app.\nSelect the Assign button next to the user or group that you want to assign.\nSelect the Done button to complete the assignment.\n\nStep 4: Share the app's metadata URL\n\nOnce you have completed the setup in Okta, you will be redirected to the application's instances page with the Sign On tab selected. Under Sign on methods, copy the Metadata URL.\n\nAdd the Metadata URL in the Clerk Dashboard\n\nAfter following the instructions in the email, your customer should have sent you the Okta app's Metadata URL. Now, you're going to add it to the Clerk connection, completing the SAML connection configuration.\n\nNavigate to the SSO connections⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nSelect the SAML connection.\nIn the Identity Provider Configuration section, under Metadata configuration, paste the Metadata URL that you received from the customer.\nSelect Fetch & save. Keep the page open for the next step.\nEnable the connection in Clerk\n\nThe SAML connection is ready to enable! Once enabled, all users with email addresses ending in the domain will be redirected to Okta at sign-up and sign-in.\n\nWarning\n\nIf there are existing users with email domains that match the SAML connection, and there is an error in the SAML configuration in Clerk or Okta, those users will be unable to sign in when the connection is enabled. If this is a concern, we recommend coordinating with your counterpart to test the connection at an off-peak time.\n\nTo make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:\n\nNavigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where you should still have the connection's configuration page open.

Common OIDC scopes include openid, email, and profile.\nSelect Save.\n\nNote\n\nMost IdPs provide a Discovery Endpoint to retrieve metadata about an OIDC provider. If your IdP doesn't offer this endpoint or if you need greater control over the setup process, in the connection's configuration page in the Clerk Dashboard, find the Identity Provider Configuration section and select Use Manual Configuration to manually configure the connection.\n\nConfigure attribute mapping (optional)\n\nClerk expects the claims returned by your IdP to follow the OIDC Standard⁠. If your provider returns claims in a non-standard format, use the Attribute Mapping section on the connection's configuration page to adjust the mapping of Clerk's user properties to match the IdP's claim attributes.\n\nWarning\n\nOIDC Enterprise connections require the email_verified⁠ claim to verify email ownership. However, some IdPs, such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory, might not return this claim or use a non-standard format.\n\nIf the IdP doesn't return this claim, you can leave the Email address verified field blank and set the Default value to True. This should only be done if you fully trust the IdP, as it can expose your app to OAuth attacks⁠.\n\nAllow additional identifiers (optional)\n\nUser profile information is sourced from the IdP. To allow users to add new identifiers (e.g., email address or phone number) to their profiles:\n\nIn the connection's configuration page of the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Advanced tab.\nEnable Allow additional identifiers.\nSelect Save.\nEnable the connection for Clerk\n\nTo make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:\n\nNavigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where you should still have the connection's configuration page open.

This is the email domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application. Optionally, select an Organization.\nSelect Add connection.\nConfigure for your production instance\n\nFor production instances, you must provide custom credentials. If you already configured Microsoft as a social provider, you can skip this step. EASIE SSO will automatically use the credentials you configured for your social connection.\n\nTo make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the Clerk Dashboard⁠ and one for your Microsoft Azure portal⁠.\n\nEnable Microsoft as an EASIE connection\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect Add connection and select For specific domains or organizations.\nUnder EASIE, select Microsoft.\nEnter the Domain.

Keep this modal and page open.\nCreate a Microsoft Entra ID app\n\nTip\n\nIf you already have a Microsoft Entra ID app you'd like to connect to Clerk, select your app from the Microsoft Azure portal⁠ and skip to the next step in this tutorial.\n\nOn the homepage of the Microsoft Azure portal⁠, in the Azure services section, select Microsoft Entra ID⁠.\nIn the sidenav, open the Manage dropdown and select App registrations⁠.\nSelect New Registration. You'll be redirected to the Register an application page.\nComplete the form as follows:\nUnder Name, enter your app name.\nUnder Supported account types, select Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox).\nUnder Redirect URI (Optional), select Web as the platform and enter the Redirect URI you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.\nSelect Register to submit the form. You'll be redirected to the Overview page of your new app. Keep this page open.\nGet your Client ID and Client Secret\nFrom your app's Overview page, save the Application (client) ID somewhere secure.\nIn the sidenav, select Certificates & secrets.\nSelect New client secret.\nIn the modal that opens, enter a description and set an expiration time for your secret.\n\nWarning\n\nMicrosoft requires an expiration time for client secrets. The default is 6 months, and the maximum is 24 months. When your secret expires, your social connection will stop working until you generate a new secret. It's recommended to set a reminder before the expiration date to avoid disruption to your sign-in flow.\n\nSelect Add.\nSave the Value somewhere secure.\nEnable OpenID\nIn the left sidenav, open the Manage dropdown and select Authentication.\nIn the Front-channel logout URL field, paste the Redirect URI you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.\nUnder Implicit grant and hybrid flows, check both Access tokens and ID tokens.\nSelect Save to save the changes.\nSecure your app against the nOAuth vulnerability\n\nnOAuth⁠ is an exploit in Microsoft Entra ID OAuth apps that can lead to account takeovers via email address spoofing. Clerk mitigates this risk by enforcing stricter checks on verified email addresses.\n\nFor further security, Microsoft offers an optional xms_edov claim⁠, which provides additional context to determine whether the returned email is verified.\n\nImportant\n\nWhen adding the xms_edov claim in the Azure portal, you may see a warning saying it's invalid or not recognized. You can safely ignore this warning - xms_edov is fully supported and documented by Microsoft Entra ID for stronger email domain verification, but the Azure portal's token configuration UI may not recognize it yet.\n\nTo enable it, you must:\n\nIn the left sidenav, in the Manage dropdown, select Token configuration.\nSelect Add optional claim.\nFor the Token type, select ID. Then, in the table that opens, enable the email and xms_pdl claims.\nAt the bottom of the modal, select Add. A new modal will prompt you to turn on the Microsoft Graph email permission. Enable it, then select Add to complete the form.\nRepeat the previous steps but for Token type, select Access instead of ID. The Optional claims list should now show two claims for email and two for xms_pdl: one each for ID and Access.\nIn the left sidenav, in the Manage dropdown, select Manifest.\nIn the text editor, search for \"acceptMappedClaims\" and set its value from null to true.\nSearch for \"optionalClaims\", where you'll find the idToken and accessToken arrays. Each array has an object with the name xms_pdl. Change the name to xms_edov.\nAt the top of the page, select Save.\nIn the left sidenav, in the Manage dropdown, select Token configuration to confirm that the Optional claims list includes two claims for email and two for xms_edov: one each for ID and Access.\n\nWith these steps complete, Microsoft will send the xms_edov claim in the token, which Clerk will use to determine whether the email is verified, even when used with Microsoft Entra ID.\n\nSet the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard\nNavigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the configuration page should still be open. Paste the Client ID and Client Secret values that you saved into the respective fields.\nSelect Save.\n\nNote\n\nIf the page is no longer open, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under Use custom credentials, paste the values into their respective fields.\n\nTest your connection\n\nThe simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's Account Portal, which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Account Portal⁠ page.\nNext to Sign-in, select the button to visit the sign-in page.

Currently, Clerk offers direct integrations with the following IdPs: Microsoft Azure AD, Google Workspace, and Okta Workforce. However, you can also integrate with any other IdPs that supports the SAML protocol.\n\nThis guide shows you how to set up a SAML connection with a custom IdP in Clerk.\n\nSet up an enterprise connection in Clerk\n\nTo create a SAML connection in Clerk:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page.\nSelect Add connection and select For specific domains or organizations.\nUnder SAML, select Custom SAML Provider.\nAdd the Domain for which you want to enable this connection. This is the domain of the users you wish to allow to sign in to your application. Optionally, select an Organization.\nEnter the Name. This will be displayed on the sign-in form.\nSelect Add connection. You'll be redirected to the connection's configuration page.\nCreate a new enterprise application in your IdP\n\nCreate a new application in your IdP. In the next steps, you'll configure your IdP with the settings provided by your Service Provider (Clerk), and configure Clerk with the settings provided by your IdP. Keep both the IdP and Clerk Dashboard open.\n\nConfigure your Identity Provider\n\nThere are two options for configuring your IdP:\n\nMetadata configuration - This is where you can download your IdP's metadata file or input the metadata URL that you got from your IdP. This is the recommended way to configure your IdP, but not all IdPs support this method.\nCustom configuration - This is where you can manually input the configuration settings for your IdP.\nMetadata configuration\nIn your IdP dashboard, find where you can download the metadata file or copy the metadata URL.\nIn the Clerk Dashboard on the connection's configuration page, under Identity Provider Configuration,select Add via metadata. Input the metadata URL or upload the metadata file that you got from your IdP.\nCustom configuration\n\nIf you choose to manually input the configuration settings for your IdP, you will need to fill these three fields in the Clerk Dashboard:\n\nSSO URL - This is your IdP's URL that Clerk will redirect your users to so that they authenticate.\nEntity ID - This is the unique identifier of your IdP application.\nCertificate - This is the certificate needed for Clerk to securely connect to your IdP.\nIn your IdP dashboard, find these values and copy them.\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, paste the values you copied from your IdP into the appropriate fields, and upload the certificate you got from your IdP.\nConfigure your Service Provider\n\nTo configure your Service Provider (Clerk), your IdP will either ask for the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL and Entity ID or it will ask for the Metadata URL. If your IdP gives you the option to choose between the two, it is recommended to choose the Metadata URL as it is the quickest and most reliable way to configure your Service Provider.\n\nHere are what these settings mean:\n\nAssertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL - This is your application's URL that your IdP will redirect your users back to after they have authenticated in your IdP.\nEntity ID - This is a unique identifier for your SAML connection that your IdP application needs.\nMetadata URL - This is the URL to your SAML connection's metadata file. This is the recommended way to configure your Service Provider.\n\nTo find the values for these settings:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, on the connection's configuration page, find the Service Provider configuration section.\nCopy the values you need for your IdP.\nIn your IdP dashboard, paste the values in the appropriate fields.\n\nTip\n\nIf you closed the connection's configuration page in the Clerk Dashboard, you can find it by navigating to the SSO connections⁠ page and selecting the settings icon next to the connection you want to configure.\n\nMap your IdP's claims to Clerk fields\n\nMapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, find the Attribute mapping section. Here, you are shown what properties on the User object in Clerk are being mapped to the claims in your IdP.\n\nIn your IdP dashboard, there should be a section where you can map the IdP's claims to the attributes in Clerk. For example, Google has a Primary email claim that needs to be mapped to Clerk's mail property. During SAML configuration in the Google dashboard, Google provides a section where these claims can be mapped.\n\nIf you have additional claims that you would like to map to Clerk that are not listed in the Attribute mapping section, you can do so by following the steps in the Map other claims section.\n\nMap other claims (optional)\n\nIn Clerk, the User object has a publicMetadata property that you can use to store additional information about your users.\n\nTo map other claims from your IdP that do not have a direct mapping to Clerk attributes, you can map them to the publicMetadata property. To do this, prepend the Clerk claims with public_metadata_ during the mapping process.\n\nFor example, say you were using Google as your IdP. Google users have the \"Phone number\" attribute. Clerk does not have a direct mapping for this attribute, as you can see in the Clerk Dashboard in the Attribute mapping section. Instead, in the Google dashboard, you would map Google's \"Phone number\" claim to public_metadata_phone_number. Then, in Clerk, the value for the user's phone number would be saved in the user's User.publicMetadata under the key phone_number. Some IdP providers like Microsoft Entra map additional claims as URLs. To ensure the claims work with Clerk, you must add the claims as strings only.\n\nLearn more about how to access the metadata from our APIs.\n\nEnable the connection for Clerk\n\nTo make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, you should still have the connection's configuration page open. If not, navigate to the SSO connections⁠ page and select the connection.\nToggle on Enable connection and select Save.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

With Sign in with Solana, users instead are prompted to choose their preferred Solana wallet provider and authenticate using their Solana wallet address. This means the sign-in flow isn't tied to any single wallet app; users can select whichever Solana wallet they prefer, unlike the other Web3 authentication strategies that depend on specific Ethereum-based wallets.\n\nEnable Solana as a Web3 provider\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Web3⁠ page.\nFrom the list of web3 providers, enable Solana.\nTest authentication\n\nThe simplest way to test authentication is to visit your Clerk application's Account Portal, which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Account Portal⁠ page.\nNext to the Sign-in URL, select Visit. The URL should resemble:\nFor development – https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in\nFor production – https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in\nOn the sign-in page, you should see Solana as an option. Use it to sign in.\nCollect additional user information during sign-up (optional)\n\nWeb3 applications integrating Solana typically use the base58 encoded wallet address to identify users, which offers a high level of privacy, given the private key is required to sign transactions and is stored in the user's Web3 wallet. However, when bridging the gap between Web3 and Web2, it's often necessary to gather human-readable information about the user, such as their email address, phone number, or a username.\n\nTo collect additional information about your user during sign-up:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page.\nOn this page, enable the attributes you want to collect from your user during sign-up.\nConnect Solana to existing account\n\nUsers can connect their Solana enabled wallet to their account at any time through their user profile page. You can configure your application to use the Account Portal user profile page or the prebuilt \n<UserProfile />\n component.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This ensures secure, limited, and auditable access.\n\nFor example, consider a brand manager who wants to schedule marketing content to be published across various social platforms, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook. Many content management tools exist to help with this but they would need permission to post on the manager's behalf. Let's say the brand manager is using a fictional content management tool called \"Content Planner\".\n\nRather than asking for a username and password for each social media platform, which could compromise account security, OAuth allows Content Planner to request limited permissions (such as posting content) while restricting sensitive actions like deleting the account or changing the password.\n\nQuiz\n\nWhy not use credentials directly?\n\nShow answer\nKey terminology\n\nBefore diving deeper, it's essential to understand some common terminology around OAuth:\n\nClient: The application requesting access to a user's data/resources. For example, in the earlier scenario, Content Planner acts as the client, since it needs permission to make posts from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.\nAuthorization service (or Identity Provider, IdP): The service responsible for authenticating the user and granting third-party apps access to a user's account, based on user consent. For instance, Twitter's auth service manages this process for apps wanting to access Twitter resources. This is also known as an authorization server or Identity Provider (IdP).\nResource service (or Service Provider, SP): The service that holds the data that the client⁠ wants to access. Following the same example, Twitter's API would be the resource service. This is sometimes referred to as a resource server or Service Provider (SP).\nOAuth access token: A credential issued to the client⁠ by the authorization service after successful authentication and user consent. The client presents this token to the resource service⁠ to access protected resources on behalf of the user. Access tokens are typically short-lived and can be refreshed using a refresh token.\nScopes: Permissions that define which specific actions or data a client⁠ can access on the resource service⁠ on behalf of the user. For example, a scope might allow readings emails but not sending them. Scopes are requested by the client during the OAuth flow and are displayed to the user, usually via a consent screen.\nOAuth flow overview\n\nHere is what a typical OAuth flow, known as the Authorization Code Flow⁠, looks like:\n\nThe user selects a \"Connect\" or \"Sign in with\" option in your app.\nThey're redirected to the OAuth provider's authorization page.\nAfter they approve the request, the provider redirects them back to your app with a short-lived authorization code.\nYour server exchanges this code (along with the client_id and client_secret) for an access token⁠.\nYour app can now use this access token⁠ to make authorized requests on behalf of the user.\n\nQuiz\n\nWhy does this happen in two steps? Why return an \"authorization code\" and not just send back the OAuth token⁠ to save time and resources?\n\nShow answer\nOAuth use cases\nOAuth Scoped Access: granting a third-party app limited access to a user's data through Clerk's API, given the user's consent. This is the use case described in the diagram above. If you'd like to implement this flow, see the Use OAuth for scoped access guide.\nOAuth Single Sign-On (SSO): allowing users to sign up/sign in to an app using a third-party provider (e.g. \"Sign in with Google\"). If you'd like to implement this flow, see the Use OAuth for SSO guide.\nOAuth User Management: using OAuth as a full user registration and sign-in/out mechanism (a full authorization service built with OAuth). Please note this is not currently supported by Clerk, as we use our own architecture for user management.\nOpenID Connect (OIDC)\n\nOpenID Connect (OIDC)⁠ is an extension to OAuth written and maintained by a different standards committee, the OpenID Foundation⁠. Built on top of OAuth 2.0 and often used with it, OIDC provides a simple, reliable process for a client⁠ to verify the authenticating user's identity and retrieve basic user details as part of the OAuth flow.\n\nThe key addition that OIDC makes to OAuth is that, when returning the access⁠ and refresh tokens, as long as an openid scope is included, the authorization server should also return an additional property called id_token. This ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing basic user information such as name, email, and profile photo, helping the client identify the user who just went through the flow. Without OIDC, the client would need to use the access token to make another request to a separate API endpoint to retrieve user details. With OIDC, this extra step can be skipped since the user information is already included in the initial OAuth response.\n\nFor more details on how Clerk supports OAuth & OIDC, including features and configuration options, refer to the OAuth reference documentation.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

You can create OAuth apps, enable dynamic client registration, manage consent screens, and configure public clients. This guide covers all key OAuth features and configurations in Clerk and helps you set up the right OAuth flow for your needs.\n\nBuild an OAuth app with Clerk\n\nTo create or edit an OAuth app, navigate to the OAuth applications⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. The following sections explain the available settings for configuring your OAuth app.\n\nDynamic client registration\n\nIn addition to configuring OAuth apps manually through the Clerk Dashboard⁠, Clerk supports dynamic client registration⁠, allowing OAuth clients to be created programmatically via a public API endpoint. To enable this feature, navigate to the OAuth applications⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard and enable Dynamic client registration.\n\nCaution\n\nDynamic client registration creates a public, unauthenticated endpoint that anyone can use to register OAuth clients with your authorization service. While this can enable use cases like multi-tenant SaaS platforms, developer marketplaces, and some MCP integrations, it also introduces significant security risks:\n\nAttackers can create clients anonymously without audit trails.\nMalicious clients can use legitimate-sounding names to trick users.\nAdministrative overhead increases substantially for monitoring and cleanup.\n\nIn some use cases, dynamic client registration can be a requirement. However, it should only be enabled after carefully evaluating and accepting the associated security risks.\n\nAdditionally, when dynamic client registration is enabled, the OAuth consent screen is automatically enforced and cannot be disabled - this prevents dangerous combinations that could lead to CSRF vulnerabilities.\n\nScopes\n\nScopes define the level of access and specific user data that will be shared with the client app during authentication. The following scopes are currently available:\n\nScope\tAccess\nprofile\tGrant access to the user's personal information, such as first and last name, avatar, and username\nemail\tGrant access to the user's email address\npublic_metadata\tGrant access to the user's public and unsafe metadata\nprivate_metadata\tGrant access to the user's private metadata\nopenid\tEnables the OpenID Connect flow\n\nNote\n\nSupport for adding custom OAuth scopes is not yet available, but development is underway. The goal is to allow custom scopes to be added, accepted, and checked through Clerk SDKs. An update will be provided when this feature is available.\n\nFor early access to custom OAuth scopes, please vote or provide feedback on the roadmap here⁠.\n\nPublic clients and PKCE\n\nIn OAuth flows where a private server environment is available, the server can store and use a client_secret to securely exchange an authorization code for an access token⁠. However, in mobile apps or single-page apps (SPAs), there is often no private server-side environment available to store the client_secret and run this exchange. These are called public clients because they cannot securely store secrets. Any secret you embed in a mobile app can be extracted by someone with the right tools, and anything in a browser-based app is visible to anyone who opens the developer tools, as well as browser extensions, etc.\n\nTo support these use cases, Clerk's OAuth implementation allows public clients to exchange an authorization code without requiring a client_secret. This makes it easier for mobile and browser-based apps to complete the token exchange and retrieve access and refresh tokens, without the risk of exposing long-lived secrets.\n\nHowever, this process means public clients often need an additional layer of security to protect against interception attacks. This is where PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)⁠ comes in - PKCE helps secure public clients by replacing the client_secret with a dynamically generated proof that only the client who started the OAuth flow can provide.\n\nHere's how it works: instead of relying on a pre-shared secret, the client generates a random value called a code verifier at the start of each OAuth flow, along with a code challenge, which is a hashed version of the code verifier. The client sends the code challenge when starting the authorization flow, and later, during the token exchange, sends the original code verifier to prove it initiated the flow. The authorization service can then hash the code verifier to ensure it matches the code challenge.\n\nThis ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the authorization code, they can't complete the token exchange without the original code verifier. Only the client that started the flow has that value.\n\nQuiz\n\nCouldn't an attacker just steal the code_verifier from the browser (like from sessionStorage)?\n\nShow answer\n\nTo enable PKCE for a public client, you can enable the Public option for each OAuth app in the Clerk Dashboard⁠.\n\nConsent screen management\n\nThe OAuth consent screen shows users a confirmation dialog before they authorize OAuth applications. It ensures users understand exactly what permissions they're granting before completing the OAuth flow.\n\nThe consent screen displays:\n\nThe requesting app's name and logo.\nThe name and logo of the app receiving the request.\nThe specific access scopes that are being requested, in user-friendly language.\nClear accept/deny options.\n\nThe consent screen is enabled by default for all OAuth apps. You can enable or disable the consent screen for each OAuth app in the Clerk Dashboard⁠.\n\nImportant\n\nEnabling the consent screen for all OAuth apps is strongly recommended. Without a consent screen, any logged-in user who visits an OAuth authorization URL automatically grants access to any requested scopes. The consent screen acts as a critical security checkpoint, preventing malicious apps from silently gaining access to user accounts.\n\nToken expiration and management\nOAuth access tokens expire after 1 day.\nRefresh tokens never expire.\nAuthorization codes expire after 10 minutes.\nOIDC id_tokens expire after 1 day.\nAccess token format\n\nClerk issues OAuth access tokens as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) by default. JWTs are self-contained tokens that can be verified without making a network request to Clerk's servers.\n\nIf your use case requires instant token revocation, you can configure your OAuth application to issue opaque tokens⁠ instead. Unlike JWTs, opaque tokens require a network request to Clerk for verification, but can be revoked immediately.\n\nTo configure the token format for an OAuth application, navigate to the OAuth applications⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard and select the \"Settings\" tab, then toggle the Generate access tokens as JWTs switch on or off depending on your needs.\n\nFor a detailed comparison of JWT and opaque token formats, including trade-offs and when to use each, see Token formats.\n\nAuthorization server metadata\n\nAn important feature of modern OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) implementations is authorization server metadata. This is a standardized JSON document published by the authorization server that describes its configuration, supported features and endpoints. This metadata makes it easier for clients to automatically discover important endpoints and features without needing manual configuration.\n\nYou can easily retrieve this metadata by loading your Clerk Frontend API URL⁠ with /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server appended to it. For example:\n\nhttps://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server for a development environment.\nhttps://clerk.<INSERT_YOUR_APP_DOMAIN>.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server for a production environment.\n\nThis endpoint exposes all relevant details in a standardized JSON format. A sample metadata document might look like this:\n\n{\n  \"issuer\": \"https://well-hagfish-71.clerk.accounts.dev\",\n  \"authorization_endpoint\": \"https://well-hagfish-71.clerk.accounts.dev/oauth/authorize\",\n  \"token_endpoint\": \"https://well-hagfish-71.clerk.accounts.dev/oauth/token\",\n  \"jwks_uri\": \"https://well-hagfish-71.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json\",\n  \"response_types_supported\": [\"code\"],\n  \"grant_types_supported\": [\"authorization_code\", \"refresh_token\"],\n  \"token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported\": [\"client_secret_basic\", \"none\"],\n  \"scopes_supported\": [\"openid\", \"profile\", \"email\", \"public_metadata\", \"private_metadata\"],\n  \"subject_types_supported\": [\"public\"],\n  \"id_token_signing_alg_values_supported\": [\"RS256\"],\n  \"claims_supported\": [\"sub\", \"iss\", \"aud\", \"exp\", \"iat\", \"email\", \"name\"],\n  \"service_documentation\": \"https://clerk.com/docs\",\n  \"ui_locales_supported\": [\"en\"],\n  \"op_tos_uri\": \"https://clerk.com/legal/standard-terms\",\n  \"code_challenge_methods_supported\": [\"S256\"]\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Clerk supports both sides of this experience:\n\nSign in with [Other App] – Let users sign in to your Clerk app using their existing credentials from social providers like Google, Facebook, or GitHub.\nSign in with [Your App] – Let users sign in to other apps using their Clerk credentials from your app. In this case, your app becomes the identity provider.\n\nThese features help you streamline authentication for your users, whether they're signing into your Clerk-powered app or accessing external apps with their Clerk credentials. This guide covers both options in detail and provides links to additional resources where applicable.\n\nOption 1: Sign in with [Other App]\n\nThis feature allows users to sign up or sign in to your Clerk app using their existing credentials from popular social providers (also known as Identity Providers, or IdPs) like Google, Facebook, or GitHub. For example, if you enable GitHub as a social provider, then a user can sign in to your Clerk app by selecting GitHub as an option and authenticating with their GitHub account credentials.\n\nRefer to the appropriate provider's guide for implementation details.\n\nOption 2: Sign in with [Your App]\n\nClerk can be configured as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) with other clients⁠ that support these protocols. This allows users to authenticate to third-party applications using their Clerk credentials, enabling user information sharing between your Clerk app and OAuth clients.\n\nIt's the reverse of Option 1: instead of using an external provider to authenticate into your Clerk app, users use their Clerk credentials to sign in to external apps.\n\nWhat you can build\n\nWith Clerk as an IdP, you can:\n\nIntegrate with third-party tools – Let users authenticate into platforms like Notion, Retool, or custom internal tools using their credentials from your app.\nBuild a developer ecosystem – Enable partners or third-party developers to offer \"Sign in with [Your App]\" in their applications.\nSupport AI agents and automation – Allow MCP servers or AI tools to authenticate users through your app.\nImplement enterprise SSO – Provide B2B customers with centralized identity management using OpenID Connect.\nHow it works: The big picture\n\nWhen you configure Clerk as an IdP, you're registering a third-party app as an OAuth client⁠ in your Clerk Dashboard. You then provide that client with credentials (a Client ID and Client Secret) that it uses to redirect users to Clerk for authentication. After the user authenticates with Clerk, they're redirected back to the third-party app with the authorization they need.\n\nConfigure Clerk as an IdP\n\nThe following steps walk you through setting up Clerk as an OAuth provider for a third-party client⁠.\n\nHere is the general flow to set up your Clerk instance as an OAuth provider:\n\nCreate a connection or integration in the client.\nCreate an OAuth application in Clerk and configure it.\nObtain the Client ID and Client Secret from Clerk.\nEnter these credentials into the client to complete the integration.\nCreate a connection or integration in the client\n\nEnsure you have setup a new connection within the third-party client⁠ or tool where your users will authenticate. As part of this process, you'll be provided a redirect URL that you'll need to use in the next step.\n\nCreate a Clerk OAuth application\n\nTo create a Clerk OAuth application:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the OAuth applications⁠ page.\nSelect Add OAuth application. A modal will open.\nComplete the following fields:\nName - Helps you identify your application.\nScopes - The scopes that you would like to leverage. Learn more about the scopes currently supported by Clerk.\nSelect Add. A modal will open with your Client Secret. For security reasons, Clerk does not store your Client Secret and cannot show it to you again, so ensure that you copy it and store it somewhere secure, like an environment variable.\nYou'll be redirected to your app's settings page. Under Application credentials, save the Client ID somewhere secure as you'll need it later.\nIn the Redirect URIs field, add the redirect URI/URL provided by your client⁠ in the earlier step. This is the URL that Clerk will redirect to after the user has authenticated.\n\nTo learn more about the other OAuth application configuration settings, like Dynamic client registration, see the dedicated guide.\n\nConfigure your client\n\nOnce you have set up a Clerk OAuth app, you'll need to configure a few settings in your client⁠ to establish the connection. All the necessary information can be found in your Clerk OAuth app's settings, starting with two key parameters:\n\nClient ID: Public identifier of your Clerk OAuth app.\nClient Secret: Confidential secret used to authenticate your Clerk OAuth app.\n\nBoth of these are available in your Clerk OAuth app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard⁠. They need to be entered into your client's setup interface to complete the integration. Once completed, your users will be able to authenticate into the third-party app using their Clerk credentials.\n\nOther available settings that may be useful include:\n\nDiscovery URL: Used by the client to retrieve the configuration data of the Clerk OAuth app.\nAuthorize URL: Used by the client to request authorization from your user.\nToken URL: Used by the client to exchange an authorization code for an access token⁠ and a refresh token.\nUser Info URL: Used by the client to retrieve additional user data upon authentication.\nGet additional user information with the OAuth 2.0 flow\n\nAfter a user has successfully completed an OAuth 2.0 flow, you can retrieve additional user information from Clerk's /oauth/userinfo⁠ endpoint. When making the request to this endpoint, you must include the OAuth access token in the Authorization header.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but can be adapted for any framework/language. It assumes the OAuth flow has already been completed and that you have obtained an access token⁠ from Clerk.\n\napp/api/userinfo/route.ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  // Assume you already have the access token available here\n  const accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'\n\n  try {\n    // Your Frontend API URL can be found on the API keys page in the Clerk Dashboard\n    // https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys\n    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL}/oauth/userinfo`, {\n      headers: {\n        // Include the access token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,\n      },\n    })\n\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      const errorData = await response.json()\n      return NextResponse.json(errorData, { status: response.status })\n    }\n\n    const data = await response.json()\n    return NextResponse.json(data)\n  } catch (error: unknown) {\n    return NextResponse.json(\n      { error: 'Failed to fetch user info', details: (error as Error).message },\n      { status: 500 },\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nExample response\n\n{\n  \"object\": \"string\",\n  \"instance_id\": \"string\",\n  \"user_id\": \"string\",\n  \"sub\": \"string\",\n  \"email\": \"string\",\n  \"email_verified\": true,\n  \"family_name\": \"string\",\n  \"given_name\": \"string\",\n  \"name\": \"string\",\n  \"username\": \"string\",\n  \"preferred_username\": \"string\",\n  \"picture\": \"string\",\n  \"public_metadata\": {},\n  \"private_metadata\": {},\n  \"unsafe_metadata\": {}\n}\n\nThe /oauth/userinfo endpoint provides the following user properties, depending on the granted scopes:\n\nProperty\tDescription\nuser_id\tThe ID of the user\nsub\tThe ID of the user\ngiven_name\tThe user's first name\nfamily_name\tThe user's last name\nname\tThe user's full name\npicture\tThe user's avatar URL\npreferred_username\tThe user's username\nemail\tThe user's primary email address\nemail_verified\tWhether the user's primary email address is verified\npublic_metadata\tThe user's public metadata\nprivate_metadata\tThe user's private metadata\nunsafe_metadata\tThe user's unsafe metadata\nGet token information\n\nFor validating access tokens⁠ or refresh tokens and retrieving additional token metadata, Clerk provides a standard OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection Endpoint⁠ at /oauth/token_info⁠.\n\nThe endpoint returns detailed token information such as if the token is still active, the Client ID, and the granted scopes.\n\nWarning\n\nThis endpoint is protected. You must provide your Clerk Client ID and Client Secret credentials to authenticate.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but can be adapted for any framework/language. It demonstrates how to call the /oauth/token_info endpoint, assuming you already have the access token and refresh token available.\n\napp/api/tokeninfo/route.ts\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\n// Assume you already have the access token and refresh token available here\nconst tokens = {\n  accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE',\n  refreshToken: 'YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE',\n}\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    // Your Frontend API URL can be found on the API keys page in the Clerk Dashboard\n    // https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys\n    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL}/oauth/token_info`, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: {\n        // Include the access token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${tokens.accessToken}`,\n        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\n      },\n      body: new URLSearchParams({\n        // Include the refresh token in the body\n        token: tokens.refreshToken,\n      }),\n    })\n\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to fetch token info' }, { status: response.status })\n    }\n\n    const data = await response.json()\n    return NextResponse.json(data)\n  } catch (error) {\n    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })\n  }\n}\n\nExample response\n\n{\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"client_id\": \"string\",\n  \"iat\": 0,\n  \"scope\": \"string\",\n  \"sub\": \"string\"\n}\nGet additional user information with the OAuth 2.0 flow using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol\n\nImportant\n\nNot all third-party apps expect or use OIDC. However, this feature was designed with OIDC compatibility in mind, which is why it's included in this guide. Ensure that your integration target supports OIDC before proceeding.\n\nIn order to enable OIDC in your OAuth flow, you can follow the same steps outlined above, but ensure to select the openid scope when configuring your OAuth app in the Clerk Dashboard. This scope triggers OIDC and instructs the authorization server to issue an ID token alongside your access token⁠.\n\nYou'll also need to include this openid scope in the query parameters of your authorization endpoint when initiating the OAuth flow. For example:\n\nGET /oauth/authorize?\n  client_id=x&\n  response_type=code&\n  state=y&\n  code_challenge=z&\n  redirect_uri=a&\n  scope=openid%20profile%20email&...\nHost: clerk.<INSERT_YOUR_APP_DOMAIN>.com\n\nOnce a user successfully authenticates using the OIDC flow, you'll receive:\n\nAn access token⁠\nA refresh token\nAn ID token\n\nThe ID token is a JWT (JSON Web Token) that contains standard JWT claims as defined in RFC 7519⁠, as well as additional custom claims that represent the authenticated user's profile information. The token is signed using your instance's private key.\n\nYou must verify the signature on the ID token before using any of the user information it contains. This will require your instance's public key. You can find your instance's public key by loading your Frontend API URL⁠ with /.well-known/jwks.json appended to it. For example:\n\nhttps://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json for a development environment.\nhttps://clerk.<INSERT_YOUR_APP_DOMAIN>.com/.well-known/jwks.json for a production environment.\n\nHere is an example verifying the ID token using the jsonwebtoken⁠ library in a production environment:\n\nconst jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')\n\nfunction verifyIdToken(idToken) {\n  jwt.verify(\n    idToken,\n    PUBLIC_KEY,\n    {\n      algorithms: ['RS256'],\n      issuer: 'https://clerk.<YOUR_APP_DOMAIN>.com',\n      audience: '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>',\n    },\n    (err, decoded) => {\n      if (err) {\n        console.error('Token verification failed:', err)\n      } else {\n        console.log('Token is valid:', decoded)\n      }\n    },\n  )\n}\n\nThe ID token includes the following standard claims:\n\nStandard claim\tDescription\niss\tThe issuer of the token, which matches your Clerk Frontend API URL\nsub\tThe subject of the token, which matches the authenticated user ID\naud\tThe intended audience of the token, which matches the used Client ID\nexp\tThe expiration time of the token\niat\tThe time at which the token was issued\njti\tA unique identifier for the token\n\nDepending on the granted scopes, the ID token can include the following additional claims:\n\nAdditional claim\tDescription\nnonce\tThe nonce provided and used during the request\nfamily_name\tThe user's last name\ngiven_name\tThe user's first name\nname\tThe user's full name\npicture\tThe user's avatar URL\npreferred_username\tThe user's username\nemail\tThe user's primary email address\nemail_verified\tWhether the user's primary email address is verified\npublic_metadata\tThe user's public metadata\nprivate_metadata\tThe user's private metadata\nunsafe_metadata\tThe user's unsafe metadata\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This enables applications to interact with user data in a secure and controlled manner, based on the user's explicit consent. The most common implementation of OAuth scoped access is the \"Authorization Code Flow⁠\", which is the flow covered in this guide.\n\nHow the flow works\n\nBefore diving into implementations details, it's important to understand the different actors involved in this flow:\n\nClient: The third-party app that wants to access a user's data from your application (the resource service⁠). This app is configured to obtain OAuth tokens⁠ from Clerk.\nAuthorization service (or Identity Provider, IdP): The service that authenticates the user and grants the OAuth tokens⁠. In this example, Clerk would be the authorization service or IdP.\nResource service (or Service Provider, SP): The service that holds the data that the client⁠ wants to access. In this example, this would be your own application that uses Clerk for authentication and route protection.\n\nNote\n\nIf you would like to know more about the terminology around OAuth, check out the OAuth terminology guide.\n\nThis guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to build OAuth scoped access into a Clerk app.\n\nCreate a Clerk OAuth application\n\nTo create a Clerk OAuth application:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the OAuth applications⁠ page.\nSelect Add OAuth application. A modal will open.\nComplete the following fields:\nName - Helps you identify your application.\nScopes - The scopes that you would like to leverage. Learn more about the scopes currently supported by Clerk.\nSelect Add. A modal will open with your Client Secret. For security reasons, Clerk does not store your Client Secret and cannot show it to you again, so ensure that you copy it and store it somewhere secure, like an environment variable.\nYou'll be redirected to your app's settings page. Under Application credentials, save the Client ID somewhere secure as you'll need it later.\nIn the Redirect URIs field, add the redirect URI provided by your client⁠. This is the URL that Clerk will redirect to with an authorization code after the user has authenticated and consented to the access request. This guide uses http://localhost:3000/oauth_callback as an example.\n\nTo learn more about the other OAuth application configuration settings, like Dynamic client registration, see the dedicated guide.\n\nTest the OAuth flow\n\nIf you are aiming to integrate your Clerk app with a third-party app that acts as an OAuth client⁠, you can reference their documentation on how to integrate OAuth connections in order to test your OAuth flow. It will likely be necessary to provide the client_id and client_secret from the OAuth app created above.\n\nIf you don't have a specific, existing OAuth client in mind, you can use the following OAuth test client⁠ project. It contains a minimal Express.js server that can run through an OAuth flow. Let's walk through how to use this test client below.\n\nNote\n\nThis implementation follows the OAuth specification⁠, and is not specific to Clerk or this test project. Any compliant OAuth client will behave the same way.\n\nClone the following repository⁠ to your machine.\nIn your terminal and within your project, run the following command:\nterminal\ncp .env.sample .env\nIn your newly created .env file, add the required credentials:\nCLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: Your Clerk Publishable Key from the API keys⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nCLIENT_ID: The client ID of your OAuth app from the Clerk Dashboard.\nCLIENT_SECRET: The client secret of your OAuth app from the Clerk Dashboard.\nIn your terminal, run the following command to install dependencies:\nterminal\nnpm i\nIn your terminal, run the following command to start the server:\nterminal\nnpm start\nFinished 🎉\n\nOnce this is complete, you'll be able to see the OAuth flow begin. If you are not currently signed in, you'll first be presented with a sign in screen. After signing in, Clerk will redirect to an OAuth consent screen, showing the requested scopes and asking for your consent.\n\nNote\n\nThe consent screen uses the scopes passed in the authorization request to inform the user exactly what they're granting access to, and to whom.\n\nBy default, the consent screen is shown for all newly created OAuth apps, but this can be disabled in each app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard⁠, although not recommended. Learn more about how Clerk's OAuth consent screen works.\n\nOnce you have accepted, you'll be redirected to the OAuth callback route, the redirect_uri specified earlier. This process will exchange the authorization code for an access token⁠, and return the access token and refresh token as a JSON response, similar to this:\n\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"xxx\",\n  \"expires_in\": 7200,\n  \"id_token\": \"xxx\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"xxx\",\n  \"scope\": \"openid email profile\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\"\n}\n\nWith the OAuth flow complete, the client⁠ now has a working access token. The next step would normally be for the client to use that token to make an authenticated request to your app's API endpoints. To learn more about how to accept and verify OAuth tokens using Clerk, see the guide on verifying OAuth tokens.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Machine token usage is free during our public beta period but will be subject to pricing once generally available. Pricing is expected to be competitive and below market averages.\n\nClerk's SDKs support this through the acceptsToken parameter that can be used in Clerk's route protection functions, such as \nauth()\n, \nauth.protect()\n, and authenticateRequest(). The SDKs automatically handle verification for both JWT and opaque token formats - no code changes are required regardless of which format you've configured.\n\nIf you need to verify JWT-formatted OAuth tokens outside of Clerk's SDKs, you can use the same approach as manual JWT verification using your instance's public key.\n\nFor examples and best practices on verifying OAuth tokens with Clerk SDKs, see our framework-specific guides for:\n\nNext.js\nReact Router\nTanStack React Start\n\nYou can also verify tokens manually via the Clerk REST API⁠.

Once the sign-in process is completed, Clerk will then use the redirect_url query string to redirect the user back to example.com/foo.\n\nHowever, you can customize this behavior to redirect users to a specific page by using the following methods:\n\nEnvironment variables (recommended)\nProps on Clerk components\nEnvironment variables\n\nThe following environment variables are available for customizing your redirect URLs.\n\nFor the FORCE and FALLBACK variables, it's recommended to define both sign-up and sign-in variables, as some users may choose to sign up instead after attempting to sign in, and vice versa.\n\nGeneral\nNext.js\nVariable\tDescription\tExample\nCLERK_SIGN_IN_URL\tThe full URL or path to your sign-in page.

When enabled in the Clerk Dashboard, these tasks are handled automatically within the <SignIn /> and <SignUp /> components and Clerk's Account Portal.\n\nAvailable tasks\n\nEach task is identified by a unique SessionTask['key']. You can use these task keys to conditionally handle different requirements in your application logic.\n\nThe following table lists the available tasks and their corresponding keys.\n\nSetting\tKey\tDescription\nAllow Personal Accounts\tchoose-organization\tDisabled by default when enabling Organizations for instances created after August 22, 2025⁠. When disabled, users are required to choose an Organization after authenticating. When enabled, users can choose a Personal Account⁠ instead of an Organization.\nForce password reset\treset-password\tEnabled by default for instances created after December 8, 2025⁠. When enabled, the user is required to reset their password on their next sign-in if their password is marked as compromised.\nSession states\n\nAfter authentication, users enter one of three states:\n\nSigned-in: Authentication complete. Can access protected content or routes.\nPending: Authentication complete, but session tasks incomplete. By default, treated as signed-out, and therefore can't access protected content or routes.\nSigned-out: Authentication failed or not attempted. Can't access protected content or routes.\nDisplaying tasks\n\nOnce enabled in the Clerk Dashboard, task components are embedded by default within the <SignUp /> and <SignIn /> components. However, if you want to customize the route where the task components are rendered or customize their appearance, you can host them within your application.\n\nThe following table lists the available tasks and their corresponding components. See the linked reference guide for usage instructions.\n\nName\tComponent\nPersonal Accounts disabled (default)\t\n<TaskChooseOrganization />\n\nForce password reset\t\n<TaskResetPassword />\nNo components, no problem\n\nIf the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can build custom flows⁠ to handle session tasks. See the dedicated guide for more information.\n\nRedirecting to tasks\n\nYour sign-up/sign-in flow should handle session tasks, but if a user's authentication flow is interrupted and they aren't able to complete the tasks, their session will remain in a pending (signed-out) state and they won't be able to access protected content. You can use these methods to redirect them to the appropriate task page so they can complete the tasks and move their session to an active (signed-in) state. These methods are also helpful when you want to redirect to custom task pages instead of using the Clerk Account Portal.\n\nThe following methods are available to redirect users to the appropriate task page when they have pending session tasks:\n\nThe taskUrls option: Protect your entire application\nMiddleware: Protect your entire application, route groups, or individual routes\nThe <RedirectToTasks /> component: Protect routes\nUsing the taskUrls option\n\nThe taskUrls option allows you to specify custom URL paths where users are redirected after sign-up or sign-in when specific session tasks need to be completed.\n\nConfigure the taskUrls option on the \n<ClerkProvider>\n component.\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  taskUrls={{\n    'choose-organization': '/session-tasks/choose-organization',\n    'reset-password': '/session-tasks/reset-password',\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\n\nThen, create a page at that URL path with the UI to handle the task. For example, if you want to handle the choose-organization task, you can create a page at /session-tasks/choose-organization that uses the \n<TaskChooseOrganization />\n component to handle the task. Or if you don't want to use the prebuilt components, you can build a custom flow⁠.\n\napp/session-tasks/choose-organization/page.tsx\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <TaskChooseOrganization redirectUrlComplete=\"/dashboard\" />\n}\nUsing middleware-based redirects\nUsing isAuthenticated\n\nWhen using the isAuthenticated property in middleware to protect routes, it will return false if the user has a pending session. Then, you can handle how to respond to pending users, such as redirecting them to a custom page to fulfill the session tasks. This example is written for Next.js, but you can use the comments in the example to help you adapt it to your SDK.\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nconst isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req: NextRequest) => {\n  // The `Auth` object gives you access to properties like `isAuthenticated`\n  // Accessing the `Auth` object differs depending on the SDK you're using\n  // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object\n  const { isAuthenticated, redirectToSignIn, sessionStatus } = await auth()\n\n  // Handle pending users\n  // This example redirects pending users to the /session-tasks page\n  // so they can fulfill the session tasks\n  if (!isAuthenticated && sessionStatus === 'pending' && isProtectedRoute(req)) {\n    const url = req.nextUrl.clone()\n    url.pathname = '/session-tasks'\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url)\n  }\n\n  // Send users who are not authenticated\n  // and don't have pending tasks to the sign-in page\n  if (!isAuthenticated && isProtectedRoute(req)) {\n    return redirectToSignIn()\n  }\n})\nUsing the <RedirectToTasks /> control component\n\nThe \n<RedirectToTasks />\n control component redirects users to the appropriate task page when they have pending session tasks. It can be used in layout files to protect multiple pages or in individual pages to protect a single page.\n\nSession handling\n\nBy default, pending sessions are treated as signed-out across Clerk's authentication context. Some control components and authentication utilities accept a treatPendingAsSignedOut prop to control how pending sessions are handled:\n\ntrue (default): Treats pending sessions as signed-out. Users can't access protected content or routes.\nfalse: Treats pending sessions as signed-in. Users can access protected content or routes.\nControl components\n<Protect />\n<SignedOut />\n<SignedIn />\n\nThe \n<Protect />\n component protects content or even entire routes based on a user's authentication state. It will render its children if the user's state is signed-in. It accepts a fallback prop that will be rendered if the user's state is signed-out.\n\nIf the user's state is pending, they will see the fallback content because, by default, pending sessions are treated as signed-out.\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Protect fallback={<p>Signed-out and pending users can see this.</p>}>\n      <p>Only signed-in users can see this.</p>\n    </Protect>\n  )\n}\n\nIf the user's state is pending, they will see the protected content because treatPendingAsSignedOut is set to false.\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Protect\n      treatPendingAsSignedOut={false}\n      fallback={<p>Users that are signed-out can see this.</p>}\n    >\n      <p>Users that are signed-in or pending can see this.</p>\n    </Protect>\n  )\n}\nAuthentication utilities\n\nThe useAuth() hook and helpers that access the Auth object, such as getAuth() or request.auth, will return null if the user has a pending session. Most utilities accept a treatPendingAsSignedOut option that defaults to true. You can pass false to treat pending sessions as signed-in.\n\nExample: Personal Accounts disabled\n\nWhen Organizations are enabled, Personal Accounts⁠ are disabled by default and your users will be required to select or create an Organization after authenticating. Until completed, their session remains pending. Pages that are protected using Clerk's protection utilities will treat the user's session as signed-out.\n\nFor useAuth(), isSignedIn will be false and userId and orgId will be null if the user has a pending session.\n\nexport default function Dashboard() {\n  const { isSignedIn, userId, orgId } = useAuth()\n\n  if (!isSignedIn) {\n    return (\n      <p>\n        User has no session, or has a pending session. They either need to sign in, or they need to\n        complete tasks by selecting or creating an Organization.\n      </p>\n    )\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <p>\n      User {userId} has a valid session and {orgId} is defined\n    </p>\n  )\n}\n\nFor helpers that access the Auth object, isAuthenticated would return false and userId and orgId would return null if the user has a pending session. This example uses the Next.js-specific \nauth()\n helper, but you can use the comments in the example to help you adapt it to your SDK.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // The `Auth` object gives you access to properties like `isAuthenticated` and `userId`\n  // Accessing the `Auth` object differs depending on the SDK you're using\n  // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object\n  const { isAuthenticated, userId, orgId } = await auth()\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return (\n      <p>\n        User has no session, or has a pending session. They either need to sign in, or they need to\n        complete pending session tasks by selecting or creating an Organization.\n      </p>\n    )\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <p>\n      User {userId} has a valid session and {orgId} is defined\n    </p>\n  )\n}\nExample: Accessing the userId for pending sessions\n\nBy default, users with a pending session are treated as signed-out, and their userId will not be available. However, in some cases, you may want to access the user's ID even if their session is still pending. In these cases, you can set treatPendingAsSignedOut to false, which will treat pending sessions as signed-in and allow you to access the userId. This example uses the Next.js-specific \nauth()\n helper, but you can use the comments in the example to help you adapt it to your SDK.\n\napp/api/get-teams/route.tsx\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport const POST = async () => {\n  // `treatPendingAsSignedOut` is set to `false` to allow access to the `userId` for pending sessions\n  // Accessing the `Auth` object differs depending on the SDK you're using\n  // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object\n  const { isAuthenticated, userId, has } = await auth({ treatPendingAsSignedOut: false })\n\n  // Check if the user is signed-out\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return Response.json({ error: 'User is signed-out' }, { status: 401 })\n  }\n\n  // Now the pending user's `userId` can be used for your use case\n  // This is a basic example of creating a resource using the `userId`\n  try {\n    const newResource = await resources.create({\n      userId,\n    })\n\n    return Response.json({ data: newResource }, { status: 201 })\n  } catch (error) {\n    return Response.json({ error: 'Failed to create resource' }, { status: 500 })\n  }\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

When the user visits the invitation link, they will be redirected to the Account Portal sign-up page and their email address will be automatically verified. If you want to redirect the user to a specific page in your application, you can specify a redirect URL when creating the invitation.\n\nInvitations expire after a month. If the user clicks on an expired invitation, they will get redirected to the application's sign-up page and will have to go through the normal sign-up flow. Their email address will not be auto-verified.\n\nTip\n\nInvitations are only used to invite users to your application. The application will still be available to everyone even without an invitation. If you're looking to restrict access to invited users only, refer to the Restricted sign-up mode.\n\nCreate an invitation\n\nYou can create an invitation either in the Clerk Dashboard or programmatically. When making this decision, keep in mind that if you create an invitation through the Clerk Dashboard, you can only set an invitation expiration date. If you create an invitation programatically, you are able to set more options, such as the URL you want the user to be redirected to after they accept the invitation, metadata to add to the invitation, or whether an invitation should be created if there is already an existing invitation for the given email address.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard\n\nTo create an invitation in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Invitations⁠ page.\n\nProgrammatically\n\nTo create an invitation programmatically, you can either make a request directly to Clerk's Backend API or use the createInvitation() method as shown in the following example.\n\nNext.js\nAstro\nExpress\nReact Router\nTanStack React Start\napp/routes/api/example.tsx\nimport { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { clerkClient } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nexport const ServerRoute = createFileRoute('/api/example')({\n  server: {\n    handlers: {\n      POST: async () => {\n        await clerkClient().invitations.createInvitation({\n          emailAddress: 'invite@example.com',\n          redirectUrl: 'https://www.example.com/my-sign-up',\n          publicMetadata: {\n            example: 'metadata',\n            example_nested: {\n              nested: 'metadata',\n            },\n          },\n        })\n\n        return json({ success: true })\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n\nSee the Backend API reference⁠ for an example of the response.\n\nWith a redirect URL\n\nWarning\n\nYou currently cannot specify a redirect URL when creating an invitation in the Clerk Dashboard; if you need to specify a redirect URL, you need to create the invitation programmatically.\n\nWhen you create an invitation programmatically, you can specify a redirectUrl parameter. This parameter tells Clerk where to redirect the user when they visit the invitation link.\n\nOnce the user visits the invitation link, they will be redirected to the page you specified, which means you must handle the sign-up flow in your code for that page. You can either embed the \n<SignUp />\n component on that page, or if the prebuilt component doesn't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can build a custom flow.\n\nTip\n\nTo test redirect URLs in your development environment, pass your port (e.g. http://localhost:3000).\nTo use the Account Portal, pass the URL provided by Clerk on the Account Portal⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. For example, https://prepared-phoenix-98.accounts.dev/sign-up redirects the user to the Account Portal sign-up page.\nWith invitation metadata\n\nWhen you create an invitation programmatically, you can specify a publicMetadata parameter to add metadata to an invitation. Once the invited user signs up using the invitation link, the invitation metadata will end up in the user's public metadata.

Each User has at least one authentication identifier, which might be their email address, phone number, or a username.\n\nA user can be contacted at their primary email address or primary phone number. They can have more than one registered email address, but only one of them will be their primary email address (User.primaryEmailAddress). This goes for phone numbers as well; a user can have more than one, but only one phone number will be their primary (User.primaryPhoneNumber). At the same time, a user can also have one or more external accounts by connecting to social providers such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and many more (User.externalAccounts).\n\nFinally, a User object holds profile data like the user's name, profile picture, and a set of metadata that can be used internally to store arbitrary information. The metadata are split into publicMetadata and privateMetadata. Both types are set from the Backend API⁠, but public metadata can also be accessed from the Frontend API⁠.\n\nFor more information on the User object, such as helper methods for retrieving and updating user information and authentication status, see the reference docs. The User object is also available in the backend, but it looks slightly different. For more information, see the Backend User object reference docs.\n\nManage users\n\nYou can manage your users in the Clerk Dashboard, or programmatically.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard\n\nTo manage users in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Users⁠ page.\n\nProgrammatically\n\nYou can manage users programmatically through the frontend or backend.\n\nIn the frontend\n\nDepending on the level of abstraction you need, you can manage users in the frontend using Clerk's prebuilt components, React hooks, or lower-level JavaScript methods.\n\nPrebuilt components: Clerk provides the prebuilt components \n<UserButton />\n and \n<UserProfile />\n to help your users manage their profile data.\nHooks: Because Clerk's React-based SDKs are built on top of the Clerk React SDK, you can use the \nhooks\n that the React SDK provides. These hooks include access to the User object and helpful methods for managing user authentication and profile data.\nJavaScript methods: If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the custom flow guides.\nIn the backend\n\nThe \nJS Backend SDK\n is a wrapper around the Backend API⁠ that makes it easier to interact with the API. It includes many methods for managing users, such as getUser(), createUser(), and deleteUser(). For more information, see the \nJS Backend SDK reference docs\n.\n\nCreate users\n\nYou can create users either in the Clerk Dashboard or programmatically.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard\n\nTo create a user in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Users⁠ page and select Create user.\n\nProgrammatically\n\nTo create a user programmatically, you can either make a request directly to Clerk's Backend API or use the createUser() method as shown in the following example.\n\nNext.js\nAstro\nExpress\nReact Router\nTanStack React Start\napp/routes/api/example.tsx\nimport { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { clerkClient } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nexport const ServerRoute = createFileRoute('/api/example')({\n  server: {\n    handlers: {\n      POST: async () => {\n        await clerkClient().users.createUser({\n          emailAddress: ['test@example.com'],\n          password: 'my-secure-password',\n        })\n\n        return json({ success: true })\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\nDelete users\n\nYou can delete users either in the Clerk Dashboard or programmatically.\n\nImportant\n\nBulk deletion of users cannot currently be done through the Clerk Dashboard or programmatically.

Here are examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server-side to get you started.\n\nServer-side\n\nThe \nauth()\n helper returns the \nAuth\n object of the currently active user, which contains important information like the current user's session ID, user ID, and Organization ID, and the isAuthenticated property, which can be used to protect your API routes.\n\nIn some cases, you may need the full \nBackend User\n object of the currently active user. This is helpful if you want to render information, like their first and last name, directly from the server. The clerkClient() helper returns an instance of the \nJS Backend SDK\n, which exposes Clerk's Backend API resources through methods such as the \ngetUser()\n method. This method returns the full Backend User object.\n\nIn the following example, the userId is passed to the JS Backend SDK's getUser() method to get the user's full Backend User object.\n\nServer function\nAPI Route\nsrc/routes/index.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute, redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { clerkClient, auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\nimport { UserButton } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\n\nconst authStateFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {\n  // The `Auth` object gives you access to properties like `isAuthenticated` and `userId`\n  // Accessing the `Auth` object differs depending on the SDK you're using\n  // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object\n  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await auth()\n\n  // Protect the server function from unauthenticated users\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    // This might error if you're redirecting to a path that doesn't exist yet\n    // You can create a sign-in route to handle this\n    // See https://clerk.com/docs/reference/tanstack-react-start/custom-sign-in-or-up-page\n    throw redirect({\n      to: '/sign-in/$',\n    })\n  }\n\n  // Get the user's full `Backend User` object\n  const user = await clerkClient().users.getUser(userId)\n\n  return { userId, firstName: user?.firstName }\n})\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: Home,\n  beforeLoad: () => authStateFn(),\n  loader: async ({ context }) => {\n    return { userId: context.userId, firstName: context.firstName }\n  },\n})\n\nfunction Home() {\n  const state = Route.useLoaderData()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome, {state.firstName}!</h1>\n      <p>Your ID is {state.userId}</p>\n      <UserButton />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nClient-side\n\nTo access session and user data on the client-side, use Clerk's useAuth() and useUser() hooks.\n\nuseAuth()\n\nThe \nuseAuth()\n hook provides information about the current auth state, as well as helper methods to manage the current session.\n\nroutes/example.tsx\nimport { useAuth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/example')({\n  component: Example,\n})\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, userId, sessionId, getToken } = useAuth()\n\n  const fetchExternalData = async () => {\n    // Use `getToken()` to get the current user's session token\n    const token = await getToken()\n\n    // Use `token` to fetch data from an external API\n    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {\n      headers: {\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,\n      },\n    })\n\n    return response.json()\n  }\n\n  // Use `isLoaded` to check if Clerk is loaded\n  if (!isLoaded) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  // Use `isSignedIn` to check if the user is signed in\n  if (!isSignedIn) {\n    // You could also add a redirect to the sign-in page here\n    return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      Hello, {userId}! Your current active session is {sessionId}.\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nuseUser()\n\nThe \nuseUser()\n hook enables you to access the \nUser\n object, which contains the current user's data such as their full name.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use useUser() to check if the user is signed in and display their first name:\n\nroutes/example.tsx\nimport { useUser } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/example')({\n  component: Example,\n})\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser()\n\n  if (!isLoaded) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  if (!isSignedIn) {\n    // You could also add a redirect to the sign-in page here\n    return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>\n  }\n\n  return <div>Hello, {user.firstName}!</div>\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

If you're storing metadata as a custom claim in the session token, it's highly recommended to keep it under 1.2KB. Learn more about the session token size limitations.\n\nIf you use Clerk metadata and modify it server-side, the changes won't appear in the session token until the next refresh. To avoid race conditions, either force a JWT refresh after metadata changes or handle the delay in your application logic.\n\nPublic metadata\n\nPublic metadata can be read by both the frontend and the backend, but can only be set on the backend. This is useful for storing data that you want to expose to the frontend, but don't want the user to be able to modify. For example, you could store a user's birthday.\n\nAccess public metadata\n\nTo access public metadata on the frontend, it's available on the User object, which can be accessed using the \nuseUser()\n hook.\n\nTo access public metadata on the backend, it's available on the Backend User object which can be accessed using the getUser() method. This method will return the User object which contains the public metadata. However, this method is subject to rate limits, so if you are accessing the metadata frequently, it's recommended to attach it to the user's session token.\n\nSet public metadata\n\nTo set public metadata, see the updateUserMetadata() reference.\n\nPrivate metadata\n\nPrivate metadata can only be read and set by the backend and webhook handlers, which makes this useful for storing sensitive data that you don't want to expose to the frontend. For example, you could store a user's Stripe customer ID.\n\nAccess private metadata\n\nTo access private metadata on the backend, it's available on the Backend User object which can be accessed using the getUser() method. This method will return the User object which contains the private metadata. However, this method is subject to rate limits, so if you are accessing the metadata frequently, it's recommended to attach it to the user's session token.\n\nSet private metadata\n\nTo set private metadata, see the updateUserMetadata() reference.\n\nUnsafe metadata\n\nUnsafe metadata can be both read and set from the frontend and the backend. It's called \"unsafe\" metadata because it can be modified directly from the frontend, which means malicious users could potentially tamper with these values.\n\nUnsafe metadata is the only metadata property that can be set during sign-up, so a common use case is to use it in custom onboarding flows. Custom data collected during the onboarding (sign-up) flow can be stored in the SignUp object. After a successful sign-up, SignUp.unsafeMetadata is copied to the User object as User.unsafeMetadata. From that point on, the unsafe metadata is accessible as a direct attribute of the User object.\n\nAccess unsafe metadata\n\nTo access unsafe metadata on the frontend, it's available on the User object, which can be accessed using the \nuseUser()\n hook.\n\nTo access unsafe metadata on the backend, it's available on the Backend User object which can be accessed using the getUser() method. This method will return the User object which contains the unsafe metadata. However, this method is subject to rate limits, so if you are accessing the metadata frequently, it's recommended to attach it to the user's session token.\n\nSet unsafe metadata\n\nSee the following examples to see how to set unsafe metadata on the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side).\n\nClient-side\nServer-side\nReact-based SDKs\nJavaScript\n\nFor React-based SDKs, such as Next.js, use the \nuseUser()\n hook to update unsafe metadata.\n\npage.tsx\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { user } = useUser()\n  const [birthday, setBirthday] = useState('')\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input type=\"text\" value={birthday} onChange={(e) => setBirthday(e.target.value)} />\n\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          user?.update({\n            unsafeMetadata: { birthday },\n          })\n        }}\n      >\n        Update birthday\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nMetadata in the session token\n\nRetrieving metadata from the User object on the server-side requires making an API request to Clerk's Backend API, which is slower and is subject to rate limits. You can store it in the user's session token, which doesn't require making an API request as it's available on the user's authentication context. However, there is a size limitation to keep in mind. Clerk stores the session token in a cookie, and most browsers cap cookie size at 4KB⁠. After accounting for the size of Clerk's default claims, the cookie can support up to 1.2KB of custom claims. Exceeding this limit will cause the cookie to not be set, which will break your app as Clerk depends on cookies to work properly.\n\nIf you need to store more than 1.2KB of metadata, you should store the extra data in your own database instead. If this isn't an option, you can move particularly large claims out of the token and fetch them using a separate API call from your backend, but this approach brings back the issue of making an API request to Clerk's Backend API, which is slower and is subject to rate limits.\n\nAnother limitation of storing metadata in the session token is that when you modify metadata server-side, the changes won't appear in the session token until the next refresh. To avoid race conditions, either force a JWT refresh after metadata changes or handle the delay in your application logic.\n\nIf you've considered the limitations, and you still want to store metadata in the session token:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\nUnder Customize session token, in the Claims editor, you can add any claim to your session token that you need and select Save. To avoid exceeding the session token's 1.2KB limit, it's not recommended to add the entire user.public_metadata object. Instead, add individual fields as claims, like user.public_metadata.birthday. When doing this, it's recommended to leave particularly large claims out of the token to avoid exceeding the session token's size limit.

It's a helpful feature for customer support and debugging.\n\nImportant\n\nYou can perform up to 5 user impersonations per month for free. To increase this limit, refer to the pricing page⁠.\n\nImpersonate a user\n\nThe easiest way to impersonate a user is from the Users⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nTo impersonate a user, on the right side of a user's row, select on the menu icon (three stacked dots). A dropdown menu will appear. When you select the Impersonate user option, your application instance should open in a new tab with the impersonated user signed in.\n\nTo add user impersonation functionality to your application, see the custom flow for user impersonation.\n\nHow user impersonation works\n\nClerk allows developers or admins of an application to sign in as different users. The feature involves two parts:\n\nGet an actor token that can be used to sign in as a different user.\nDetect an impersonated session as soon as you're signed in.\nActor tokens\n\nActor tokens are similar to sign-in tokens⁠. They can be used for one-time sign-ins, but they result in impersonated sessions.\n\nCreate an actor token\n\nTo create an actor token, you can use the Backend API⁠.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to create an actor token by making a request directly to Clerk's Backend API using cURL. Using the generated token will result in user with ID user_21Ufcy98STcA11s3QckIwtwHIES (the actor/impersonator) signing in as user with ID user_1o4qfak5AdI2qlXSXENGL05iei6 (the subject/impersonated).\n\ncurl -X POST https://api.clerk.com/v1/actor_tokens -d '{ \\\n  \"user_id\": \"user_1o4qfak5AdI2qlXSXENGL05iei6\", \\\n  \"expires_in_seconds\": 600 \\\n  \"actor\": { \\\n    \"sub\": \"user_21Ufcy98STcA11s3QckIwtwHIES\", \\\n  } \\\n}'\n\nWhen creating actor tokens, the object that you pass as the actor parameter will end up in the authentication token's act claim. You can read more details in the guide on session tokens.\n\nRevoke an actor token\n\nTo revoke an actor token, you can use the Backend API⁠.\n\nDespite it's expiration date, you can revoke a token at any time. Revoked actor tokens can no longer be used for signing in.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to revoke an actor token by making a request directly to Clerk's Backend API using cURL, even if it's not expired yet.\n\ncurl -X POST https://api.clerk.com/v1/actor_tokens/act_2EL6mQKzeUtoRwGuLZsznyfkIsH/revoke\nSign in with an actor token\n\nActor tokens are consumed the same way as sign in tokens.\n\nOnce you've successfully created an actor token, you can use the url attribute of the response to consume the token and impersonate a user.\n\nThe url attribute is a Clerk Frontend API URL⁠ that will use the token to sign out existing users and prepare the SignIn object for impersonation. You can directly visit the url provided in the response to consume the actor token.\n\nThe Frontend API⁠ will redirect you to the /sign-in page of your application, where the flow will continue by consuming the __clerk_ticket parameter.\n\nHow to detect impersonated sessions\n\nOnce a user is signed in as a different user, Clerk provides APIs and helper methods to distinguish an impersonated session from a regular session.\n\nClerk also adds an act claim on the Clerk session token, which contains information like the impersonated session ID and the actor/impersonator's user ID.\n\nNote\n\nWhen using a custom JWT template, the {{session.actor}} will need to be added as a claim in order to expose it.\n\nDetect impersonated sessions in the frontend\n\nTo detect impersonated sessions in the frontend, the actor object contains the sub claim of the impersonator. You can use this information to detect impersonated sessions.\n\nHook\nJavaScript\n\nYou can use the \nuseAuth()\n hook to get access to the authentication context, which includes the actor object.\n\nconst { userId, actor } = useAuth()\n\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    Server-side info:\n    <p>\n      {actor && (\n        <span>\n          User {actor.sub} has signed in as user {userId}\n        </span>\n      )}\n    </p>\n  </div>\n)\nDetect impersonated sessions in the backend\n\nThe Auth object is a server-side object that contains the actor object, as well as important information like the current user's session ID and user ID. Accessing the Auth object differs depending on the SDK you're using. Here are some examples:\n\nNext.js\nAstro\nExpress\nReact Router\nTanStack React Start\n\nThe TanStack React Start SDK provides the auth() function to access the Auth object. \nLearn more about using auth()\n.\n\nsrc/routes/api/example.tsx\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\nimport { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const ServerRoute = createFileRoute('/api/example')({\n  server: {\n    handlers: {\n      GET: async () => {\n        // Use `auth()` to access the `Auth` object\n        const { actor, userId } = await auth()\n\n        return json({ actor, userId })\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The scope can either be o for Organization-level Features if there is an Active Organization⁠, or u for user-level Features or if there is no active Organization.\to:dashboard,o:impersonation\nsts\tsession status\tThe status of the current session\tpending\nOrganization claim\n\nThe o claim, or Organization claim, is only included if the user is part of an Organization and that Organization is active⁠. Its value is an object that contains the following properties:\n\nClaim\tAbbreviation expanded\tDescription\tExample\t\nid\tID\tThe ID of the Organization.\torg_123\t\nslg\tslug\tThe slug of the Organization.\torg-slug\t\nrol\trole\tThe Role of the user in the Organization, without the org: prefix.\tadmin\t\nper\tpermissions\tThe names of the Permissions the user has in the Organization.\tread,manage\t\nfpm\tfeature-permission map\tfeature-permission map\tThe mapping of Features with Permissions. Learn how this value is constructed.\t3,2\n\nWarning\n\nThe Organization claims above are intentionally designed to be as compact as possible to keep JWT tokens small. As a result, they can be difficult to decode manually. We strongly recommend using one of our SDKs that support API version 2025-04-10 to handle decoding reliably.\n\nDecode o.fpm manually\n\nFor those that need to decode the o.fpm claim manually, here is how the claim value is computed.\n\nThe o.fpm value is a list of comma-separated integers where the position of the integer corresponds to a Feature in the same position in the fea claim. So, the first Feature in the fea claim corresponds to the first integer in the o.fpm claim, and so on.\n\nEach integer, when converted to binary, represents a bitmask where each bit's position corresponds to a Permission in the o.per list, where 0 = not-allowed and 1 = allowed. The first bit position in the bitmask is the rightmost, least significant bit. It corresponds to the first Permission in the o.per list, which is the leftmost element. This results in a sort of \"reverse\" mapping, seen in the example below.\n\nExample\n\nConsider a user with an Active Organization has Role admin. This Role has the following Feature-Permission mapping: dashboard:read, dashboard:manage, teams:read. Therefore, the user's claims are as follows:\n\nfea claim has value o:dashboard,o:teams\no.per claim has value manage,read\no.fpm claim has value 3,2\n\nNow, let's manually decode the o.fpm claim.\n\nThe first integer 3 represents the Feature-Permission mapping for the dashboard Feature, since it's the first Feature in the fea claim. Then, converting 3 to binary, you get 11, which means both Permissions are allowed (dashboard:read and dashboard:manage).\n\nThe second integer 2 represents the Feature-Permission mapping for the teams Feature, since it's the second Feature in the fea claim. Then, converting 2 to binary, you get 10, which means the second Permission is allowed (teams:read). This is because you read bitmask from right to left, so the first bit, 0, corresponds to the first Permission in the o.per list (manage) and the second bit, 1, corresponds to the second Permission in the o.per list (read).\n\nActor claim\n\nThe act (actor) claim is only included if the user is impersonating another user. It's value is an object that contains the following properties:\n\nClaim\tAbbreviation expanded\tDescription\tExample\niss\tissuer\tThe referrer of the token.\thttps://dashboard.clerk.com\nsid\tsession ID\tThe session ID of the impersonated session.\tsess_456\nsub\tsubject\tThe ID of the impersonator.\tuser_456\n\nIf you would like to add custom claims to your session token, you can customize it.\n\nYou can also create custom tokens using a JWT template.\n\nSize limitations\n\nClerk stores the session token in a cookie, and most browsers limit cookie size to 4KB⁠. Exceeding this limit will cause the cookie to not be set, which will break your app as Clerk depends on cookies to work properly.\n\nA session token with the default session claims won't run into this issue, as this configuration produces a cookie significantly smaller than 4kb. However, this limitation becomes relevant when implementing a custom session token. In this case, it's recommended to move particularly large claims out of the token and fetch these using a separate API call from your backend.\n\nClaims to monitor for size limits:\n\nuser.organizations\nuser.public_metadata\nuser.unsafe_metadata\norg.public_metadata\norg_membership.public_metadata\n\nIf you add any of these custom claims in your token, use caution to ensure the stored data doesn't exceed the size limit. It's highly recommended to store the extra data in your own database instead of storing it in metadata in the session token. If this isn't an option, you can move particularly large claims like these out of the token and fetch them using a separate API call from your backend.\n\nNote\n\nIf your application encounters this issue, the Clerk Dashboard will display a warning: \"Some users are exceeding cookie size limits\". To resolve this, update your custom session token.\n\nExample\n\nIt's recommended to keep the total size of custom claims in the session token under 1.2KB. The following example shows how to move particularly large claims out of the session token and fetch them using a separate API call from your backend. The limitations of this approach are that if you make this call to Clerk's Backend API frequently, you risk hitting rate limits and it's also slower than making a database query. We highly recommend storing the extra data in your own database instead of storing it in metadata in the session token.\n\nFor example, if you were storing several fields in user.public_metadata, like this:\n\n// user.public_metadata\n{\n  onboardingComplete: true,\n  birthday: '2000-01-01',\n  country: 'Canada',\n  bio: 'This is a bio -- imagine it is 6kb of written info',\n}\n\nInstead of storing all of that data in the session token, and possibly exceeding the 1.2KB limit, like this:\n\n// Custom claims in the session token\n{\n  \"metadata\": \"{{user.public_metadata}}\"\n}\n\nYou could store only the necessary data in the session token - for example, just the onboardingComplete field - like this:\n\n// Custom claims in the session token\n{\n  \"onboardingComplete\": \"{{user.public_metadata.onboardingComplete}}\"\n}\n\nThen, when you need to access the other metadata fields, you can fetch them using a separate API call from your backend. The following example uses the getUser() method to access the current user's Backend User object, which includes the publicMetadata field.\n\nIf your SDK isn't listed, you can use the comments in the example to help you adapt it to your SDK.\n\nNext.js\nAstro\nExpress\nReact Router\nTanStack React Start\napp/routes/api/example.tsx\nimport { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nexport const ServerRoute = createFileRoute('/api/example')({\n  server: {\n    handlers: {\n      GET: async () => {\n        // The `Auth` object gives you access to properties like `isAuthenticated` and `userId`\n        // Accessing the `Auth` object differs depending on the SDK you're using\n        // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object\n        const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await auth()\n\n        if (!isAuthenticated) {\n          return new Response('User not authenticated', {\n            status: 404,\n          })\n        }\n\n        // Initialize the JS Backend SDK\n        // This varies depending on the SDK you're using\n        // https://clerk.com/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart\n        // Use the `getUser()` method to get the Backend User object\n        const user = await clerkClient().users.getUser(userId)\n\n        // Return the Backend User object\n        return json({ user })\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\nValidate session tokens\n\nIf you're using the middleware provided by our Clerk SDKs, validating session tokens is handled automatically in every request.

Depending on your architecture, these tokens will be in your backend requests either via a cookie named __session or via the Authorization header.\n\nFor every request, you must validate the token to ensure it hasn't expired or been tampered with (i.e., it's authentic and secure). If these validations succeed, then the user is authenticated to your application and should be considered signed in. The authenticateRequest() method from the JS Backend SDK handles these validations for you. Alternatively, you can manually verify the token without using the SDK. See the following sections for more information.\n\nUse authenticateRequest() to verify a session token\n\nThe authenticateRequest() method from the JS Backend SDK accepts the request object and authenticates the session token in it.\n\nThe following example uses the authenticateRequest() method to verify the session token. It also performs networkless authentication by passing jwtKey. This verifies if the user is signed into the application.\n\nauthenticateRequest() requires publishableKey to be set. If you are importing clerkClient from a higher-level SDK, such as Next.js, then clerkClient infers the publishableKey from your environment variables.\n\nNext.js\nAstro\nExpress\nJS Backend SDK\nReact Router\nTanStack React Start\napp/routes/api/example.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { clerkClient } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nexport const ServerRoute = createFileRoute('/api/example')({\n  server: {\n    handlers: {\n      GET: async ({ request }) => {\n        // Use the `authenticateRequest()` method to verify the token\n        const { isAuthenticated } = await clerkClient().authenticateRequest(request, {\n          authorizedParties: ['https://example.com'],\n          jwtKey: process.env.CLERK_JWT_KEY,\n        })\n\n        if (!isAuthenticated) {\n          return Response.json({ status: 401 })\n        }\n\n        // Add logic to perform protected actions\n\n        return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' })\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\nManually verify a session token\nRetrieve the session token\n\nRetrieve the session token from either __session cookie for a same-origin request or from the Authorization header for cross-origin requests.\n\nGet your instance's public key\n\nUse one of the three ways to obtain your public key:\n\nUse the Backend API in JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) format at the following endpoint https://api.clerk.com/v1/jwks⁠.\nUse your Frontend API URL⁠ in JWKS format, also known as the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URL⁠. The format is your Frontend API URL with /.well-known/jwks.json appended to it.\nUse your JWKS Public Key, which can be found on the API keys⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nVerify the token signature\n\nTo verify the token signature:\n\nVerify that the token's algorithm has the expected value.\nUse your instance's public key to verify the token's signature.\nValidate that the token isn't expired by checking the exp (expiration time⁠) and nbf (not before⁠) claims.\nValidate that the azp (authorized parties) claim equals any of your known origins permitted to generate those tokens. For better security, it's highly recommended to explicitly set the authorizedParties option when authorizing requests. The value should be a list of domains allowed to make requests to your application. Not setting this value can open your application to CSRF attacks⁠. For example, if you're permitting tokens retrieved from http://localhost:3000, then the azp claim should equal http://localhost:3000. You can also pass an array of strings, such as ['http://localhost:4003', 'https://clerk.dev']. If the azp claim doesn't exist, you can skip this step.\nOptional: Check for a sts claim\n\nIf you are using Clerk's Organizations feature and have not enabled Personal Accounts⁠, users are required to be part of an Organization before accessing your application. If the user has completed registration, but is not yet part of an Organization, a valid session token will be created, but the token will contain a sts (status) claim set to pending. You may want to reject requests to your backend with pending statuses to ensure that users are not able to work around the Organization requirement.\n\nFinished\n\nIf the above process succeeds, the user is considered signed in to your application and authenticated. You can also retrieve the session ID and user ID from of the token's claims.\n\nExample\n\nThe following example manually verifies a session token.\n\nimport Cookies from 'cookies'\nimport jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'\n\nexport default async function (req: Request, res: Response) {\n  // Your public key should be set as an environment variable\n  const publicKey = process.env.CLERK_PEM_PUBLIC_KEY\n  // Retrieve session token from either `__session` cookie for a same-origin request\n  // or from the `Authorization` header for cross-origin requests\n  const cookies = new Cookies(req, res)\n  const tokenSameOrigin = cookies.get('__session')\n  const tokenCrossOrigin = req.headers.authorization\n\n  if (!tokenSameOrigin && !tokenCrossOrigin) {\n    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Not signed in' })\n    return\n  }\n\n  try {\n    let decoded\n    const options = { algorithms: ['RS256'] } // The algorithm used to sign the token.\n    const permittedOrigins = ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com'] // Replace with your permitted origins\n\n    if (tokenSameOrigin) {\n      decoded = jwt.verify(tokenSameOrigin, publicKey, options)\n    } else {\n      decoded = jwt.verify(tokenCrossOrigin, publicKey, options)\n    }\n\n    // Validate the token's expiration (exp) and not before (nbf) claims\n    const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)\n    if (decoded.exp < currentTime || decoded.nbf > currentTime) {\n      throw new Error('Token is expired or not yet valid')\n    }\n\n    // Validate the token's authorized party (azp) claim\n    if (decoded.azp && !permittedOrigins.includes(decoded.azp)) {\n      throw new Error(\"Invalid 'azp' claim\")\n    }\n\n    res.status(200).json({ sessionToken: decoded })\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({\n      error: error.message,\n    })\n  }\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

If you are looking for how to customize your Clerk-generated session token, refer to the Customize your session token guide.\n\nClerk offers the ability to generate JSON Web Tokens⁠ (JWTs). Each JWT, or token, represents a user that is currently signed in to your application.\n\nYou can control the claims that will go into these tokens by creating custom JWT templates that fit your needs. This enables you to integrate with any third-party services that support authentication with JWTs. An example use case is integrating with a third-party service that is able to consume JWTs, but requires them to be in a particular format.\n\nWarning\n\nWhen using custom JWTs, there may be increased latency in token generation due to the additional processing required to fetch and include the custom claim data.\n\nWhat is a JWT template?\n\nJWT templates are essentially JSON objects that specify claims to be included in the generated tokens, along with their respective values.\n\nClaim values can be either static or dynamic.\n\nStatic values can be any of the regular JSON data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, null) and will be included as-is in the tokens.\n\nDynamic values, also called shortcodes, are special strings that will be substituted for their actual values when the tokens are generated. Read more in the Shortcodes section.\n\nThe following example shows a template that demonstrates both static values and shortcodes. In this example, the values of the aud and interests claims are static, and the values of the name and email claims are dynamic.\n\n{\n  \"aud\": \"https://example.com\",\n  \"interests\": [\"hiking\", \"knitting\"],\n  \"name\": \"{{user.first_name}}\",\n  \"surname\": \"{{user.last_name}}\",\n  \"email\": \"{{user.primary_email_address}}\"\n}\n\nA token generated using the template above would look something like this:\n\n{\n  \"aud\": \"https://example.com\",\n  \"interests\": [\"hiking\", \"knitting\"],\n  \"name\": \"John\",\n  \"surname\": null,\n  \"email\": \"john@doe.org\"\n  // ...plus some automatically-included claims\n  // See the following section section for more information\n}\nDefault claims\n\nIn every generated token, there are certain claims that are automatically included and cannot be overridden by templates. Clerk calls these \"default claims\" and you can learn more about them in the Session tokens reference documentation.\n\nFor custom JWTs, Clerk automatically includes the following default claims:\n\n{\n  // default claims, included automatically\n  \"azp\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n  \"exp\": 1639398300,\n  \"iat\": 1639398272,\n  \"iss\": \"https://clean-mayfly-62.clerk.accounts.dev\",\n  \"jti\": \"10db7f531a90cb2faea4\",\n  \"nbf\": 1639398220,\n  \"sub\": \"user_1deJLArSTiWiF1YdsEWysnhJLLY\"\n}\n\nHowever, other default claims - such as sid (session ID) - are only included in session-bound tokens, not in custom JWTs. Custom JWTs are not inherently tied to a session. Instead, they're designed to be flexible tokens that include the default claims listed above, along with any additional claims you explicitly set in your JWT template. For this reason, session-tied claims like sid, v, pla, or fea cannot be included in custom JWTs.\n\nIf you need to generate a token that includes both session-bound data (like sid) and any additional claims, the recommended approach is to use a custom session token instead of a JWT template. See the guide on customizing your Clerk session token.\n\nShortcodes\n\nTo include dynamic values in your tokens, you can use shortcodes. Shortcodes are strings that Clerk will replace with the actual values of the corresponding user information when the token is generated.\n\nNote\n\nEven though shortcodes are string values, their type in the generated token depends on the original type of the information that's included. For example, {{user.public_metadata}} will be substituted for a JSON object, not a string.\n\nMetadata in shortcodes\n\nWhile you can use the {{user.public_metadata}} or {{user.unsafe_metadata}} shortcodes to include the complete metadata object in the final token, there might be cases where you only need a specific piece of information.\n\nTo keep your tokens lean, you can use the dot notation to access nested fields of the metadata object.\n\nLet's assume the user's public metadata are the following:\n\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"hiking\", \"knitting\"],\n  \"addresses\": {\n    \"Home\": \"2355 Pointe Lane, 56301 Minnesota\",\n    \"Work\": \"3759 Newton Street, 33487 Florida\"\n  }\n}\n\nTo access the interests array, you would use the shortcode {{user.public_metadata.interests}}. To access the Home address, you would use {{user.public_metadata.addresses.Home}}. See the following example:\n\n// The template\n{\n  \"likes_to_do\": \"{{user.public_metadata.interests}}\",\n  \"shipping_address\": \"{{user.public_metadata.addresses.Home}}\"\n}\n\n// The generated token\n{\n  \"likes_to_do\": [\"hiking\", \"knitting\"],\n  \"shipping_address\": \"2355 Pointe Lane, 56301 Minnesota\"\n}\nInterpolation in shortcodes\n\nShortcodes can be interpolated inside strings.\n\nFor example, you could use interpolation to build the user's full name:\n\n{\n  \"full_name\": \"{{user.last_name}} {{user.first_name}}\"\n}\n\nInterpolated shortcodes will always result to string values. For example, if the user does not have a last name associated, the above full name value would be null John.\n\nConditional expressions in shortcodes\n\nConditional expressions use the || operator and can be used to substitute a default fallback value for shortcodes that would otherwise result in null or false values.\n\nThe format of a conditional expression is the following:\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"{{ <operand_1> || <operand_2> || <operand_n> }}\"\n}\n\nThe result of a conditional expression is that of the first operand that does not evaluate to null or false (also known as \"falsy\"). If all operands of the expression are falsy, the last operand is returned no matter its value. Therefore, you should always place the default value as the last operand. See the following example:\n\n{\n  \"has_verified_contact_info\": \"{{user.email_verified || user.phone_number_verified}}\",\n\n  // fallback to a string value\n  \"full_name\": \"{{user.full_name || 'Awesome User'}}\",\n\n  // fallback to a number value\n  \"age\": \"{{user.public_metadata.age || user.unsafe_metadata.age || 30 }}\"\n}\n\nFor this example, in the case that user:\n\nhas verified their phone number\nhas not verified their email\nhas not provided their first or last name\ndoes not have any public or unsafe metadata assigned\n\nThen, the output of the generated token would be:\n\n{\n  \"has_verified_contact_info\": true,\n  \"full_name\": \"Awesome User\",\n  \"age\": 30\n}\n\nThe rules that govern conditional expressions are as follows:\n\nThe result of an expression is either the first operand that is not falsy, or the last operand (no matter its value).\nString literals should use single quotes (').\nOnly strings, booleans and numbers are permitted as literal (i.e. non-shortcodes) operands.\nCreate a JWT template\n\nA template consists of the following four properties:\n\nTemplate name: a unique identifier for the template. When generating a token, you will have to specify the template to use, using this name. This is a required field.\nToken lifetime: the time in seconds, after which tokens generated with this template will expire. This setting determines the value of the exp claim (i.e. exp=current_time+lifetime). Default is 60 seconds.\nToken allowed clock skew: the time in seconds, provided as a leeway to account for clock skews between different servers. This setting determines the value of the nbf claim (i.e. nbf=current_time-allowed_clock_skew). Default is 5 seconds.\nClaims: the actual template that's entered into the JSON editor (see screenshot below). A template is essentially a JSON object that describes what the final token claims will look like (shortcodes can be used here). This is a required field.\n\nTo create a JWT template:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the JWT templates⁠ page.\nSelect New template.\nYou can either select a blank template or choose one of the provided templates.\nGenerate a JWT\n\nTo generate a token using a template, you can use the getToken() method. See the reference documentation for more information and example usage.\n\nComplete example\n\nThe following example demonstrates the full capabilities of JWT templates, including static claim values, dynamic claim values via shortcodes, and Clerk's \"default claims\".\n\nGiven the following user:\n\nFirst name: Maria\nLast name: Doe\nProfile picture URL: https://example.com/avatar.jpg\nClerk ID: user_abcdef123456789\nEmail address (verified): maria@example.com\nPhone number: (not provided)\nPublic metadata: { \"profile\" : {\"interests\": [\"reading\", \"climbing\"] } }\nUnsafe metadata: { \"foo\" : { \"bar\": 42 } }\n\nAnd given the following JWT template:\n\n{\n  // static values\n  \"aud\": \"https://my-site.com\",\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"foo\": { \"bar\": [1, 2, 3] },\n\n  // dynamic values\n  \"user_id\": \"{{user.id}}\",\n  \"avatar\": \"{{user.image_url}}\",\n  \"full_name\": \"{{user.last_name}} {{user.first_name}} \",\n  \"email\": \"{{user.primary_email_address}}\",\n  \"phone\": \"{{user.primary_phone_address}}\",\n  \"registration_date\": \"{{user.created_at}}\",\n  \"likes_to_do\": \"{{user.public_metadata.profile.interests}}\",\n  \"unsafe_meta\": \"{{user.unsafe_metadata}}\",\n  \"invalid_shortcode\": \"{{user.i_dont_exist}}\"\n}\n\nThe generated token would look like this:\n\n{\n  \"aud\": \"https://my-site.com\",\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"foo\": { \"bar\": [1, 2, 3] },\n  \"user_id\": \"user_abcdef123456789\",\n  \"avatar\": \"https://example.com/avatar.jpg\",\n  \"full_name\": \"Doe Maria\",\n  \"email\": \"maria@example.com\",\n  \"phone\": null,\n  \"registration_date\": 1227618844,\n  \"likes_to_do\": [\"reading\", \"climbing\"],\n  \"unsafe_meta\": {\n    \"foo\": {\n      \"bar\": 42\n    }\n  },\n  \"invalid_shortcode\": null,\n\n  // default claims, included automatically\n  \"azp\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n  \"exp\": 1639398300,\n  \"iat\": 1639398272,\n  \"iss\": \"https://clean-mayfly-62.clerk.accounts.dev\",\n  \"jti\": \"10db7f531a90cb2faea4\",\n  \"nbf\": 1639398220,\n  \"sub\": \"user_1deJLArSTiWiF1YdsEWysnhJLLY\"\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

However, there are some cases where you might want to force a refresh. For example, if you're retrieving information from the session token that has been updated but the token hasn't refreshed yet, the information is still old and you'll need to force the token to refresh.\n\nThere are two recommended approaches to force a user's session token to refresh:\n\ngetToken({ skipCache: true })\nuser.reload()\n\nBoth perform a network request, but getToken({ skipCache: true }) will only get a new token, while user.reload() will both get a new token and a new User object.\n\ngetToken({ skipCache: true })\n\nThe getToken() method retrieves the current user's session token. If skipCache is set to true, it will force a new token to be minted.\n\nThe skipCache property is only available on the client-side. To access getToken() from the client-side, use the \nuseSession()\n or \nuseAuth()\n hooks.\n\nExample\n\nSay you're building a user profile page and want to allow the user to set their birthday, but Clerk doesn't collect birthdays. To store information about a user that Clerk doesn't collect, you can use metadata, which will get stored on the user's User object.\n\nWhen using metadata, it's recommended to store it in the user's session token to avoid making an API request to Clerk's Backend API when retrieving it, as API requests are slower and are subject to rate limits.\n\nHowever, when retrieving the user's metadata from the session token, because the session token refreshes every 60 seconds, the metadata may not be up to date if the token hasn't refreshed yet. In this case, you'd want to force a session token refresh after updating the metadata to ensure that when the metadata is retrieved, it is the latest version.\n\nThis example requires that the user's birthday has been configured to be stored in the session token like:\n\n{\n  \"birthday\": \"{{user.public_metadata.birthday}}\"\n}\n\nTo do so, follow the guide on customizing your session token.\n\nAPI route\nClient-side page\n\nThe /update-user-metadata API route uses Clerk's updateUserMetadata() method from the \nJS Backend SDK\n to update the user's birthday metadata.\n\napp/api/update-user-metadata/route.ts\nimport { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  // Use `req.json()` to parse the request body\n  const { birthday } = await req.json()\n\n  // The `Auth` object gives you access to properties like `isAuthenticated` and `userId`\n  // Accessing the `Auth` object differs depending on the SDK you're using\n  // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object\n  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await auth()\n\n  // Protect the route from unauthenticated users\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })\n  }\n\n  // Initialize the JS Backend SDK\n  // This varies depending on the SDK you're using\n  // https://clerk.com/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart\n  const client = await clerkClient()\n\n  // Use the JS Backend SDK's `updateUserMetadata()` method to update the user's birthday\n  await client.users.updateUserMetadata(userId, {\n    publicMetadata: {\n      birthday,\n    },\n  })\n\n  return NextResponse.json({ success: true }, { status: 200 })\n}\nExpand code\nuser.reload()\n\nThe user.reload() method refreshes the current user's User object and their session token. It can be accessed from the \nuseUser()\n hook.\n\nYou only need to call user.reload() if you've updated the User object outside of the user.update() method or Clerk hooks; for example, if you made changes through an API endpoint.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This lets you build multi-tenant B2B apps like Slack (workspaces), Linear (teams), or Vercel (projects) where users switch between different team contexts.\n\nUsers can belong to multiple Organizations, and Clerk provides the Organization context (memberships, Roles, and the Active Organization) in each session. You can then use this context to control what data to show and what actions to allow.\n\nNote\n\nTo explore Organizations in Clerk, check out the demo apps⁠.\n\nHow do Organizations work?\n\nOrganizations live within your Clerk application. Each application can contain multiple Organizations, and each Organization can have multiple users. You define Roles and Permissions once at the application level, and they apply across all Organizations within that application.\n\nThe Organization that a user is currently viewing is called the Active Organization. The Active Organization determines which Organization-specific data the user can access and which Role and related Permissions they have within the Organization.\n\nClerk measures Organization usage through Monthly Retained Organizations (MROs). An MRO is an Organization with at least two members, where at least one member is a Monthly Retained User⁠. Free plans include up to 50 MROs in development and 100 in production. To increase these limits, refer to the pricing page⁠.\n\nCore workflow\n\nThe core workflow when working with Organizations can follow something along the lines of:\n\nCreate: You can create Organizations in the Clerk Dashboard⁠, or end users can create them in your application through prebuilt components or APIs. Each Organization has a profile, settings, and metadata. Users can belong to multiple Organizations and switch between them with the \n<OrganizationSwitcher/>\n component. Learn more about creating and managing Organizations.\n\nAdd members: You can add members to Organizations in different ways depending on your needs:\n\nInvitations for bottom-up adoption, where individual users invite teammates with precise control over roles.\nVerified Domains for company-wide rollouts, where Clerk automatically invites users with matching email domains (who can join immediately) or suggests they join (requiring admin approval).\nEnterprise Connections (SAML or OIDC) for top-down deployments managed by IT with centralized authentication through an Identity Provider (IdP).\n\nYou can combine these approaches: use manual invitations for external contractors alongside domain-based enrollment for employees. The Active Organization determines which members and Roles apply to the current context.\n\nControl access: You can manage access to content or entire pages using Roles and Permissions. Default admin and member Roles cover common cases, while custom Roles and Permissions provide fine-grained access for more complex needs. You can perform authorization checks⁠ in both frontend and backend code.\n\nBeyond these core steps, you can also monitor Organization health and growth with analytics in the Clerk Dashboard. This helps you spot which Organizations are growing, staying active, or dropping off, so you know what's working and where you might need attention.\n\nNext steps\n\nNow that you understand what Organizations are and how they work, you can:\n\nConfigure Organization settings\n\nLearn how to configure Organization settings.\n\nCreate and manage Organizations\n\nLearn how to create and manage Organizations to see metadata in action.\n\nInvite members to Organizations\n\nLearn how to invite members to Organizations.\n\nSet up Roles and Permissions\n\nLearn how to set up Roles and Permissions to control what invited users can access.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

These settings determine who can create Organizations, how members join them, what Roles they receive, and which Features are available. You'll configure most of these when you first enable Organizations, though you can adjust them later as your needs evolve.\n\nEnable Organizations\n\nOrganizations are disabled by default. When you enable Organizations, Clerk offers two membership requirement options:\n\nMembership required (default): Every user is required to belong to an Organization. All new and existing users will be prompted to create or join an Organization through the session tasks flow before they can access your application. This setting is common for most B2B SaaS. It's recommended to enable the Create first organization automatically setting to simplify this process.\n\nImportant\n\nThis is the default setting since on August 22, 2025. Applications created before this date will not see the Membership required setting, because organization membership was optional.\n\nMembership optional: Users can operate in their own individual workspace or join Organizations. They start in their Personal Account and can switch to Organizations using the \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n component. This setting is common for B2C applications moving to B2B.\n\nFor most B2B and multi-tenant applications, requiring organization membership is recommended to ensure proper data isolation and team structure from the start. Making membership optional is only recommended if the application serves both individual users and teams (such as tools that work for solo users but also provide team features).\n\nTo enable Organizations:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations Settings⁠ page.\nSelect Enable Organizations.\nIn the modal, choose between Membership required or Membership optional based on your decision above.\nSelect Enable.\n\nClerk measures Organizations by Monthly Retained Organizations (MROs). Refer to the overview page for pricing details and limits.\n\nOrganization settings\n\nOnce Organizations are enabled, you can configure core features and behaviors, such as membership limits, Verified Domains, Organization slugs, and whether to allow Personal Accounts alongside Organizations.\n\nMembership limits\n\nThere is no limit to the number of Organizations a user can be a member of.\n\nEach Organization allows a maximum of 5 members by default. You can increase this limit as your customer base grows, or set different limits for individual Organizations.\n\nTo change the membership limit for all Organizations in your application:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations Settings⁠ page.\nIn the Default membership limit section, update the membership limit.\nWithout B2B Authentication add-on: Allows a maximum of 20 members in an Organization\nWith B2B Authentication add-on: Allows unlimited members in an Organization\n\nTo change the membership limit for a specific Organization:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, select Organizations⁠.\nSelect the Organization you want to update.\nIn the Membership limit section, update the limit for that specific Organization.\nPersonal Accounts\n\nWhen enabling the Organizations feature, you were prompted to choose whether to make membership required (the default) or optional. If you chose to make membership optional, this enabled the Personal Accounts feature.\n\nPersonal Accounts are individual workspaces that allow users to operate independently without belonging to an Organization. When Personal Accounts are enabled, users start in their Personal Account by default and can switch between their Personal Account and any Organizations they belong to.\n\nWhen to enable Personal Accounts:\n\nEnable Personal Accounts if your application serves both individual users and teams. For example:\n\nA tool that works for solo users but also offers team collaboration features (like GitHub, where users can create repositories under their Personal Account or an Organization)\nApplications where users might want to work independently before joining or creating a team\n\nWhen to disable Personal Accounts:\n\nMost B2B and multi-tenant applications should leave Personal Accounts disabled. This ensures:\n\nProper data isolation from the start.\nClear team structure requirements.\nAll users are part of an Organization, which is essential for proper access control and billing.\n\nChanging this setting:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations Settings⁠ page.\nChoose Membership optional.\nVerified Domains\n\nVerified Domains allow automatic or suggested Organization membership for users with specific email domains (like @acme.com). This is useful for company-wide rollouts where you want to streamline enrollment for employees with company email addresses. Members with the org:sys_domains:manage System Permission can manage Verified Domains and enrollment modes.\n\nLearn more about Verified Domains.\n\nOrganization slugs\n\nImportant\n\nOrganization slugs are disabled by default for applications created after October 7, 2025. For applications created before this date, you can opt to disable it.\n\nOrganization slugs are human-readable URL identifiers (like acme-corp) that help users reference which Organization they're working in. Enable this feature if you need Organization-specific URLs or if users frequently switch between multiple Organizations.\n\nYou can also use Organization slugs in your application's URLs.\n\nCreate first organization automatically\n\nClerk can automatically create the user's first Organization. This is useful if your application requires every user to belong to an Organization.\n\nThis setting is disabled by default. To enable it:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations Settings⁠ page.\nToggle Create first organization automatically.\nDefault naming rules\n\nDefault naming rules automatically suggest an Organization name (and logo, when possible) when users create their first Organization.\n\nThese rules can be used on their own or in combination with the Create first organization automatically setting:\n\nWhen Create first organization automatically is enabled, these rules are used to name the automatically created Organization.\nWhen Create first organization automatically is disabled, these rules are used to prefill the Organization name when the user creates their first Organization manually.\n\nRules are applied in this order:\n\nDetect from email domain automatically populates the Organization name, slug, and logo from the member's email domain (e.g., alex@clerk.com → \"Clerk\").\nPersonalize from member name uses member details to create a personalized Organization name. You can customize the template using variables like user.first_name, user.last_name, user.full_name, or user.username (e.g., {{user.first_name}}'s organization → \"Alex's organization\").\nFallback name is used when no other rule can generate an Organization name. By default, this is set to \"My organization\".\n\nThis setting is disabled by default. To enable it:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations Settings⁠ page.\nToggle Default naming rules.\nUnder Default naming rules, you can disable email domain detection or member personalization rules individually. This will skip those rules when suggesting an Organization name.\nAllow user-created Organizations\n\nBy default, users can create Organizations in your application. You can restrict this if you prefer to manually provision Organizations.\n\nYou can also override this Permission for specific users in their profile page under User permissions.\n\nLearn more about creating Organizations.\n\nOrganization creation limit\n\nWhen user-created Organizations are enabled, each user can create up to 100 Organizations by default. You can configure this to set a lower limit or allow unlimited Organizations.\n\nTo change the default limit:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations Settings⁠ page.\nIn the Organization limit section, choose between:\nUsers can create unlimited organizations\nUsers can create a limited number of organizations (specify the limit)\n\nIf you need users to create more than 100 Organizations, contact support⁠ to have the limit raised.\n\nTo override this limit for a specific user:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, select Users⁠.\nSelect the user you want to update.\nIn the User permissions section, configure their Organization creation limit.\nDefault roles\n\nWhen users create or join Organizations, they need to be assigned a role. These settings determine which roles are automatically assigned in different scenarios, whether someone is creating a new Organization or joining an existing one.\n\nDefault role for members\n\nThe default role for members is assigned to users when they join an Organization through invitations or Verified Domain enrollment. By default, this is set to Member.\n\nThis role is used:\n\nWhen sending invitations from the \n<OrganizationProfile />\n component (pre-filled as default)\nWhen users auto-join via Verified Domains\nAs the suggested role for new Organization members\n\nTo change the default role:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Roles & Permissions⁠ page.\nSelect the three dots next to the role you want to set as default.\nChoose Set as Default role.\n\nLearn more about Roles and Permissions.\n\nCreator's initial role\n\nWhen a user creates a new Organization, Clerk automatically adds them as its first member and assigns them the Organization's designated Creator Role. By default, that Role is Admin, giving them full control over the Organization they created.\n\nThe Creator role must have at least these System Permissions:\n\nManage members (org:sys_memberships:manage)\nRead members (org:sys_memberships:read)\nDelete Organization (org:sys_profile:delete)\n\nLearn more about the Creator Role and how to reassign it.\n\nAllow new members to delete Organizations\n\nThis setting controls whether Organization members can delete Organizations.\n\nBy default, any member with the org:sys_profile:delete System Permission can delete an Organization. You can disable this if you want to prevent accidental data loss or require your own approval process before Organizations are removed.\n\nTo change this setting:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations Settings⁠ page.\nToggle Allow new members to delete organizations.\n\nImportant\n\nThis setting only applies to newly created Organizations. Existing Organizations retain their current deletion settings.\n\nNext steps\n\nNow that you've configured global settings, you can:\n\nCreate your first Organization\n\nLearn how to create your first Organization and start adding members.\n\nAdd members to your Organization\n\nLearn how to add members to your Organization with invitations, Verified Domains, or SSO.\n\nControl access based on Roles and Permissions\n\nLearn how to configure access control with Custom Roles and Permissions.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

When you send an invitation, Clerk sends an email to the invited user with a unique invitation link. When the user visits the Organization invitation link, Clerk redirects them to the Account Portal sign-in page. If the user is already signed in, Clerk redirects them to your application's homepage (/). If you want to redirect the user to a specific page in your application, you can specify a redirect URL when creating the invitation.\n\nBy default, only admins can invite users to an Organization.\n\nThis feature requires that Email is enabled, as Clerk uses the user's email address to send the invitation. You can still disable Email as a sign-in option if you do not want users to be able to sign-in with their email address.\n\nTo configure your application's Email settings, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nWhen to use invitations\n\nInvitations work well when you need precise control over who joins your Organization and which Role they receive. This approach fits scenarios where:\n\nTeams are small and members are known in advance.\nOnboarding requires manual approval or review.\nSpecific Roles need to be assigned during the invitation.\n\nIf you want to streamline enrollment for users with company email addresses, consider Verified Domains, which can automatically invite users based on their email domain. If customers require centralized authentication through their Identity Provider, use Enterprise SSO.\n\nCreate an invitation\n\nClerk's \nprebuilt components\n and Account Portal pages manage all Organization invitation flows, including creating, managing, and accepting invitations.\n\nHowever, if you want to build custom flows, see the following sections.\n\nClient-side\n\nTo create an Organization invitation on the client-side, see the dedicated guide. Note that this uses the organizations.inviteMember() method, which does not let you specify a redirect URL; it will always redirect to the Account Portal sign-in page. If you want to specify a redirect URL, you must create the invitation on the server-side.\n\nServer-side\n\nTo create Organization invitations on the server-side, use the Backend API⁠ either by using a cURL command or the \nJS Backend SDK\n. The JS Backend SDK is a wrapper around the Backend API that makes it easier to interact with the API.\n\nUse the following tabs to see examples for each method.\n\ncURL\nJS Backend SDK\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to create an Organization invitation using cURL.\n\nReplace YOUR_SECRET_KEY with your Clerk Secret Key⁠.\nReplace the org_123 with the ID of the Organization you want to invite the user to.\nReplace the user_123 with the ID of the user who is inviting the other user.\nReplace the email address with the email address you want to invite.\nReplace the role with the Role you want to assign to the invited user.\nterminal\ncurl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/{org_123}/invitations' \\\n-X POST \\\n-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-d '{ \"inviter_user_id\": \"user_123\", \"email_address\": \"email@example.com\", \"role\": \"org:member\" }'\n\nFor an example of the response, see the Backend API reference⁠.\n\nRedirect URL\n\nWhen you create an invitation, you can specify a redirect_url parameter. This parameter tells Clerk where to redirect the user when they visit the invitation link.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use cURL to create an invitation with the redirect_url set to https://www.example.com/accept-invitation.\n\ncurl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/{org_123}/invitations' \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{ \"inviter_user_id\": \"user_123\", \"email_address\": \"email@example.com\", \"role\": \"org:member\", \"redirect_url\": \"https://www.example.com/accept-invitation\" }'\n\nOnce the user visits the invitation link, they will be redirected to the page you specified. On that page, you must handle the authentication flow in your code. You can either embed the \n<SignIn />\n component or, if the prebuilt component doesn't meet your needs or you require more control over the logic, you can build a custom flow.\n\nTip\n\nTo test redirect URLs in your development environment, pass your port. For example, http://localhost:3000/accept-invitation.\n\nInvitation metadata\n\nYou can also add metadata to an invitation when creating the invitation through the Backend API. Once the invited user signs up using the invitation link, Clerk stores the invitation metadata (OrganizationInvitation.publicMetadata) in the Organization membership's metadata (OrganizationMembership.publicMetadata). For more details on Organization membership metadata, see the OrganizationMembership reference.\n\nTo add metadata to an invitation, add the public_metadata parameter when creating the invitation.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use cURL to create an invitation with metadata.\n\ncurl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/{org_123}/invitations' \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{ \"inviter_user_id\": \"user_123\", \"email_address\": \"email@example.com\", \"role\": \"org:member\", \"public_metadata\": {\"department\": \"marketing\"} }'\nRevoke an invitation\n\nRevoking an invitation prevents the user from using the invitation link that was sent to them.\n\nClient-side\n\nTo revoke an invitation client-side, see the dedicated guide.\n\nServer-side\n\nTo revoke an invitation server-side, use the Backend API⁠. either by using a cURL command or the \nJS Backend SDK\n. The JS Backend SDK is a wrapper around the Backend API that makes it easier to interact with the API.\n\nUse the following tabs to see examples for each method.\n\ncURL\nJS Backend SDK\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to revoke an invitation using cURL.\n\nReplace YOUR_SECRET_KEY with your Clerk Secret Key⁠.\nReplace the inv_123 with the ID of the invitation you want to revoke.\nReplace the user_123 with the ID of the user who is revoking the invitation.\nterminal\ncurl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/{org_123}/invitations/{inv_123}/revoke' \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{ \"requesting_user_id\": \"user_123\" }'\nNext steps\n\nNow that you understand how to invite users to your Organization, you can:\n\nConfigure Verified Domains\n\nLearn how to configure Verified Domains to automatically invite users based on their email domain.\n\nSet up Enterprise SSO Connections\n\nLearn how to set up Enterprise SSO Connections for centralized authentication through an Identity Provider.\n\nSet up Roles and Permissions\n\nLearn how to set up Roles and Permissions to control what invited users can access.\n\nAdd metadata to invitations\n\nLearn how to add metadata to invitations for tracking or custom workflows.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

For example, if the domain @clerk.com is verified, any user with an email address ending in @clerk.com can be automatically invited or be suggested to join an Organization with that domain. Clerk assigns users the Default Role set in the Organization settings page.\n\nA Verified Domain cannot be a disposable domain or common email provider. For example, you cannot create a Verified Domain for @gmail.com.\n\nWarning\n\nA Verified Domain can't be added if it's already in use for the Organization's Enterprise SSO.\n\nThe easiest way to add and verify domains, and manage all settings related to Verified Domains is to use Clerk's \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n component.\n\nWhen to use Verified Domains\n\nVerified Domains work well when you want to streamline enrollment for users with company email addresses. This approach fits scenarios where:\n\nCompany-wide rollouts need automatic or suggested membership.\nReducing onboarding friction for employees with approved email domains.\nEnrollment can happen based on email domain without manual approval.\n\nIf you need precise control over specific people and their Roles, use invitations. If customers require authentication through their Identity Provider, use Enterprise SSO.\n\nEnable Verified Domains\n\nEnabling Verified Domains applies to all Organizations and cannot currently be managed on a per-Organization basis.\n\nIn order to enable this feature:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations Settings⁠ page.\n\nIn the Membership options section, toggle on Enable verified domains.\n\nThe following enrollment modes will appear that can be enabled for verified domains:\n\nAutomatic invitation - Clerk automatically invites users to join the Organization when they sign up and they can join anytime.\nAutomatic suggestion - Users receive a suggestion to request to join, but must be approved by an admin before they are able to join the Organization.\n\nWhen a user with the org:sys_domains:manage Permission has added and verified a domain, they can enable an enrollment mode. Only one enrollment mode can be enabled for a Verified Domain at a time.\n\nAutomatic invitations\n\nAfter sign-up, a user will receive an invitation for the Organization if their email's domain matches the Verified Domain. If your app uses the <OrganizationSwitcher /> component, the user will see a notification on the component and also receive an email prompting them to accept the invitation.\n\nWhen they open the component, they will see a Join button next to the organization they were invited to. Selecting the button will accept the invitation and the user will instantly be added as a member of the Organization.\n\nAutomatic suggestions\n\nAfter sign-up, a user will receive a suggestion for the Organization if their email's domain matches the Verified Domain. If your app uses the <OrganizationSwitcher /> component, the user will see a Request to join button next to the Organization. Selecting the button will send a Membership Request to the Organization.\n\nMembership Requests\n\nMembership Requests are requests from users who saw an Organization Suggestion and requested to join an Organization. Membership Requests are only available for Organizations that have the Verified Domains and Automatic Suggestion features enabled in both the Dashboard and for the specific domain.\n\nWhen a user sends an Organization Membership request, users with the org:sys_memberships:manage Permission (by default, admins) are notified through both:\n\nA notification badge on the <OrganizationSwitcher /> component.\nAn email alert.\n\nRegardless of how they are notified, membership requests can only be reviewed and managed through the <OrganizationSwitcher /> component. Selecting the notification badge will open the Organization management page, where the request appears under Members > Requests. A request must be approved before the user is added to the Organization.\n\nAdd and verify domains\n\nAny user with the org:sys_domains:manage Permission can add and verify domains under an Organization. By default, admins have this Permission. To add and verify domains in the \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n component, select the General tab. There will be a Verified domains section.\n\nDomains can be verified through an email verification code sent to an email that matches the domain. If the user adding the domain already has a verified email using that domain in their account, Clerk will automatically verify the domain.\n\nAn application instance may only have one Verified Domain of the same name, and an Organization may only have one domain of the same name (verified or unverified).\n\nYou can create up to 10 domains per Organization to meet your needs. If you need more than 10 domains, contact support⁠.\n\nCustom flow\n\nIf Clerk's \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n does not meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can use the Clerk API to add and verify a domain and update the domain's enrollment mode. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\nconst { organization, domains } = useOrganization()\n\n// create domain\nconst domain = await organization.createDomain('example.com')\n\n// prepare email verification\ndomain.prepareAffiliationVerification({ affiliationEmailAddress: 'foo@example.com' })\n\n// attempt email verification\ndomain.attemptAffiliationVerification({ code: '123456' })\n\n// update domain enrollment mode\ndomain.updateEnrollmentMode({ enrollmentMode: 'automatic_invitation' })\nNext steps\n\nNow that you've configured Verified Domains, you can:\n\nSet up Enterprise SSO Connections\n\nLearn how to set up Enterprise SSO Connections for centralized authentication through an Identity Provider.\n\nInvite specific users\n\nLearn how to invite specific users that don't match your Verified Domain.\n\nSet up Roles and Permissions\n\nLearn how to set up Roles and Permissions to control what invited users can access.\n\nConfigure default Roles\n\nLearn how to configure default Roles for users joining via Verified Domains.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This guide covers working with individual Organizations. For global settings that affect all Organizations in your application (like enabling Organizations, setting default Roles, or configuring memberships), refer to the dedicated guide.\n\nCreate an Organization\n\nOrganizations can be created in the Clerk Dashboard or in your application. The number of Organizations you can create depends on your Monthly Retained Organization (MRO) limits.\n\nCreate an Organization in the Clerk Dashboard\n\nTo create an Organization in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations⁠ page and select the Create Organization button.\n\nCreate an Organization in your application\n\nBy default, users have permission to create Organizations within your application. When a user creates an Organization, they become the Organization's admin with full control over settings, members, and Permissions.\n\nDefault limits: Each user can create up to 100 Organizations. To change creation permissions or limits, see the dedicated guide.\n\nThe easiest way to allow users to create Organizations is to use the \n<CreateOrganization />\n and/or \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n components. The <OrganizationSwitcher /> component is more comprehensive, as it handles all Organization flows including creating, switching, and managing an Organization.\n\nIf the prebuilt components don't meet your needs, you can build custom flows using the Clerk API.\n\nManage Organizations\n\nAs an application owner, you can manage all Organizations in your application, both those created by you and those created by your users. You can view, update, and delete any Organization, as well as manage its members and settings.\n\nManage Organizations in the Clerk Dashboard\n\nTo manage an Organization in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Organizations⁠ page. Select a specific Organization to view its details, members, invitations, Subscriptions, payments, and settings.\n\nManage Organizations in your application\n\nFor managing Organizations in your application, Clerk provides prebuilt components that handle Organization management flows:\n\n<OrganizationProfile />\n - A profile page for the user's currently active Organization where they can update settings and manage members.\n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n - A dropdown menu that handles all Organization flows, including switching between Organizations and managing the active Organization's profile.\n<OrganizationList />\n - A list of Organizations that a user is a member of, with options to switch between them.\n\nIf the prebuilt components don't meet your needs, you can build custom flows using the Clerk API.\n\nSwitch between Organizations\n\nUsers who belong to multiple Organizations can switch between them at any time. The currently selected Organization is called the active Organization.\n\nThe \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n component provides the easiest way for users to switch between Organizations. If you need more control over the switching logic, you can use the setActive() method from the \nuseOrganizationList()\n hook, or access it directly from the Clerk object.\n\nIf Personal Accounts are enabled⁠, users can switch to their Personal Account using the <OrganizationSwitcher /> component.\n\nNext steps\n\nNow that you've created and managed Organizations, you can:\n\nAdd custom data with Organization metadata\n\nLearn how to store custom information about an Organization that is not part of the standard fields.\n\nUse Organization slugs in URLs\n\nLearn how to use Organization slugs in URLs for tenant-specific routing.\n\nInvite members to Organizations\n\nLearn how to invite members to Organizations.\n\nSet up Roles and Permissions\n\nLearn how to set up Roles and Permissions to control what invited users can access.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

You can enable Enterprise Connections for specific Organizations, allowing members to authenticate through their company's identity provider using SAML or OIDC protocols.\n\nWhen users sign up or sign in using an Organization's Enterprise Connection, Clerk automatically adds them as members of that Organization and assigns them the default Role. This process is known as Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning.\n\nWhen to use Enterprise SSO\n\nEnterprise SSO works well when customers require centralized authentication through their Identity Provider (IdP). This approach fits scenarios where:\n\nEnterprise customers have security requirements that mandate IdP-based authentication.\nIT teams need to manage user provisioning from a central location.\nOrganizations want to maintain existing identity management workflows.\n\nIf you need manual control over who joins and their Roles, use invitations. If you want automatic enrollment without IdP requirements, use Verified Domains.\n\nCommon onboarding flows\n\nThe timing of when you set up Enterprise SSO depends on how customers adopt your product. The two common approaches are to create the Organization and configure SSO before users sign in (top-down) or to let users start individually and add SSO later (bottom-up).\n\nOrganization created first (top-down approach)\n\nThis flow is common for enterprise sales where the relationship is established before users access the application.\n\nCreate an Organization for your customer through the Clerk Dashboard.\nCollaborate with the customer's IT administrator to obtain the necessary configuration details.\nConfigure the Enterprise SSO Connection for the Organization.\nInvite users to the Organization, who can then sign in using Enterprise SSO.\nUser-initiated setup (bottom-up approach)\n\nThis flow is common when individual users try the product before company-wide adoption.\n\nAn end user signs up to evaluate your application, starting with an individual account.\nAfter adopting the application, the user creates an Organization for their company.\nConfigure Enterprise SSO for the Organization through the Clerk Dashboard.\nAll subsequent users from that Organization can now sign in using Enterprise SSO.\nAdd an Enterprise SSO connection for an Organization\n\nClerk supports Enterprise SSO via SAML or via the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, either through EASIE or by integrating with any OIDC-compatible provider.\n\nTo add an Enterprise SSO Connection for an Organization, go to the Enterprise Connections docs and follow the appropriate guide based on the platform you want to use, such as the Google SAML guide. When configuring the connection in the Clerk Dashboard, there will be an option to select the Organization for which you want to enable this connection. If you don't select an Organization, Clerk will add the connection for your entire application.\n\nWarning\n\nA domain used for Enterprise SSO can't be used as a Verified Domain for the same Organization.\n\nEnforce Enterprise SSO by domain\n\nClerk enforces Enterprise SSO connections on a per-domain basis in Organizations, enabling flexible access management:\n\nConfigure Enterprise SSO for your primary domain (e.g., company.com) to enforce Enterprise SSO authentication for employees.\nAdd additional domains without Enterprise SSO for external collaborators (e.g., contractors, consultants).\nEach domain in an Organization can have different authentication requirements.\nRemove a member from your Organization\n\nUsers who joined through an Enterprise Connection cannot leave the Organization on their own. You can remove them through the Clerk Dashboard, the Backend API⁠, or by another member with the manage members Permission (org:sys_memberships:manage). However, the user will be added back to the Organization on next sign-in, unless they are removed from the IdP or the Enterprise Connection is no longer associated with the Organization.\n\nRemoved users will automatically rejoin the Organization on their next sign-in unless you also remove them from the IdP or disconnect the Enterprise Connection.\n\nMove an Enterprise Connection to a different Organization\n\nWhen you reassign an Enterprise Connection to a new Organization, existing members stay in the original Organization. They will automatically join the new Organization the next time they sign in.\n\nCommon SSO setup errors\n\nWhen setting up Enterprise SSO, you may encounter errors during the authentication flow. The type of error you see depends on which protocol your Enterprise Connection uses:\n\nSAML errors occur when using SAML-based Enterprise Connections (e.g., Azure AD, Google Workspace, Okta). These errors typically relate to SAML assertion validation, attribute mapping, or domain configuration issues.\nOAuth errors occur when using OAuth/OIDC-based Enterprise Connections (e.g., custom OIDC providers, EASIE). These errors typically relate to authorization flows, token exchange, or user information retrieval.\n\nThe following sections describe common error codes and how to resolve them.\n\nsaml_user_attribute_missing\n\nYou will encounter this error when the user's account is missing a required attribute, for example, a mail attribute.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nAccess your identity provider's configuration dashboard, navigate to your application's SAML settings or attribute mapping configuration, and ensure that the 'mail' attribute is properly mapped to the user's email address field.\n\nsaml_response_relaystate_missing\n\nYou will encounter this error when the RelayState parameter is missing from the SAML Response.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nCheck that your identity provider is correctly returning the RelayState parameter that was sent in the original request.\n\nsaml_email_address_domain_mismatch\n\nYou will encounter this error when the email address domain of the user's account does not match the domain configured for the connection.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nVerify that the user is signing in with an email address that matches one of the allowed domains for this connection.\nIf you need to add additional domains to this connection, go to your Clerk Dashboard → SSO Connections → [Your Connection] → Settings, and update the allowed domains.\nAlternatively, ensure the user is accessing the correct SAML connection that matches their email domain.\noauth_access_denied\n\nYou will encounter this error when the user clicks \"Cancel\" or \"Deny\" on the OAuth provider's authorization screen, or when the provider rejects the authorization request.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nAsk the user to try signing in again and ensure they approve the authorization request.\nVerify in your Clerk Dashboard → SSO Connections that the OAuth application credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) are correctly configured.\noauth_token_exchange_error\n\nYou will encounter this error when Clerk fails to exchange the authorization code for an access token.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nVerify in your Clerk Dashboard → SSO Connections that your OAuth application's Client ID and Client Secret are correctly configured and match the credentials from your OAuth provider's dashboard.\nEnsure that the Redirect URI configured in your OAuth provider matches exactly what Clerk expects (including the protocol, domain, and path).\noauth_fetch_user_error\n\nYou will encounter this error when Clerk is unable to retrieve the user's profile information from the OAuth provider.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nVerify that the OAuth scopes configured in your Clerk Dashboard → SSO Connections include the necessary permissions to read user profile information.\nEnsure that the user info endpoint URL is correctly configured.\nNext steps\n\nNow that you've set up Enterprise SSO, you can:\n\nSet up Enterprise SSO Connections\n\nLearn how to set up Enterprise SSO Connections for centralized authentication through an Identity Provider.\n\nJIT provisioning\n\nLearn more about JIT provisioning to customize how users are automatically added to Organizations.\n\nConfigure Verified Domains\n\nLearn how to automatically invite users who don't use SSO.\n\nInvite specific users\n\nLearn how to invite specific users to your Organization.\n\nSet up Roles and Permissions\n\nLearn how to set up Roles and Permissions to control what invited users can access.\n\nConfigure default Roles\n\nLearn how to configure default Roles for users joining via SSO.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

See the pricing⁠ page for more information.\n\nRoles and Permissions let you control who can access specific resources and perform certain actions within each Organization. Clerk provides two default Roles - admin and member - that cover most common use cases. You can also create custom Roles and fine-grained Permissions that fit your application's specific features and team setup.\n\nRoles are made available to Organizations through Role Sets. Each Organization is assigned a Role Set that determines which Roles can be assigned to its members.\n\nRoles\n\nEach Role defines what users can do and access within an Organization. You can extend a Role's capabilities by adding Permissions.\n\nDefault Roles\n\nWhen users create or join Organizations, they need to be assigned a Role. These settings determine which Roles are automatically assigned in different scenarios, whether someone is creating a new Organization or joining an existing one.\n\nFor each instance, there are currently two default Roles:\n\nAdmin (org:admin) - Offers full access to Organization resources. Members with the admin Role have all of the System Permissions. They can fully manage the Organization and Organization memberships.\nMember (org:member) - Offers limited access to Organization resources. Access to Organization resources is limited to the \"Read members\" and \"Read billing\" Permissions only, by default. They cannot manage the Organization and Organization memberships, but they can view information about other members in it.\nThe Creator Role\n\nWhen a user creates a new Organization, Clerk automatically adds them as its first member and assigns them the Organization's designated Creator Role. By default, that Role is org:admin.\n\nYou cannot delete an Organization Role if it's used as the Organization's Creator Role. But, you can reassign the Creator Role to any other Role with the right Permissions. For example, if you want to delete the admin Role, you will have to assign another Role as the Creator Role.\n\nThe Creator Role must at least have the following System Permissions:\n\nManage members (org:sys_memberships:manage)\nRead members (org:sys_memberships:read)\nDelete Organization (org:sys_profile:delete)\n\nTo reassign the Creator Role:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nCreate a new Role or use an existing Role from the list.\nEnsure that Manage members, Read members, and Delete Organization System Permissions are selected for the Role.\nOpen the three dots icon for the Role.\nFrom the dropdown, select the Set as Creator role option.\nThe Default Role for members\n\nNew Organization members are initially assigned the Default Role. By default, that Role is org:member. This Role is used as a pre-filled default in <OrganizationProfile /> invitations and for Organization enrollment with Verified Domains.\n\nYou cannot delete an Organization Role if it's used as the Organization's Default Role. But, you can reassign the Default Role to any other Role.\n\nTo reassign the Default Role:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nCreate a new Role or use an existing Role from the list.\nSelect the three dots next to the Role you want to set as default.\nFrom the dropdown, select the Set as Default role option.\nCustom Roles\n\nYou can create up to 10 custom Organization Roles per application instance to meet your application needs. If you need more than 10 Roles, contact support⁠.\n\nCustom Roles can be granted Permissions and access. For example, you can create a new Role of Billing (org:billing) which can be used to group users who belong to a specific department of the Organization and have permission to manage credit card information, invoices, and other resources related to billing.\n\nTo create a new Role:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nSelect the All roles tab.\nSelect Add role.\nGive the Role a name, a key to reference it by, and a description. The final key will follow the format org:<role>.\nSelect whether you want to include the role in the default Role Set.\nSelect Save.\n\nNote\n\nYou must add the Role to a Role Set before members can be assigned this role. Refer to Role Sets to learn more about controlling role availability.\n\nChange a user's Role\n\nYou can change a user's Role in the Clerk Dashboard or in your application using the \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n component.\n\nNote\n\nThe Roles available in the dropdown are limited to those included in the Organization's assigned Role Set. If you need to assign a Role that's not available, you'll need to add that Role to the Organization's Role Set.\n\nTo change a user's Role in the Clerk Dashboard:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, select Organizations⁠ and select an organization.\nSelect the Members tab.\nIn the list of members, find the one whose Role you want to change.\nSelect another Role from their Role dropdown.\nDelete a Role\n\nYou cannot delete a Role that is still assigned to members of an Organization. Change the members to a different Role before completing the following steps.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nSelect the All roles tab.\nSelect the three dots icon next to the Role.\nSelect Delete role.\n\nNote\n\nYou cannot delete any Roles currently assigned to one or more Organization members. If any Organization members currently have this Role, you'll need to reassign them first. Refer to Role Sets for more information.\n\nPermissions\n\nPermissions grant users privileged access to resources and operations, like creating and deleting. Clerk supports two types of Permissions: System Permissions and Custom Permissions.\n\nSystem Permissions\n\nClerk provides a set of System Permissions that power Clerk's Frontend API⁠ and \norganization-related Clerk components\n. These Permissions serve as the baseline required for Clerk to operate effectively.\n\nClerk's System Permissions consist of the following:\n\nManage Organization (org:sys_profile:manage)\nDelete Organization (org:sys_profile:delete)\nRead members (org:sys_memberships:read)\nManage members (org:sys_memberships:manage)\nRead domains (org:sys_domains:read)\nManage domains (org:sys_domains:manage)\nRead billing (org:sys_billing:read)\nManage billing (org:sys_billing:manage)\n\nYou can assign these System Permissions to any Role.\n\nWarning\n\nSystem Permissions aren't included in session claims. If you need to check Permissions on the server-side, you must create Custom Permissions for authorization checks in your application code.\n\nCustom Permissions\n\nCustom Permissions let you define fine-tuned access control within your Organization. Each Permission is tied to a Feature, and can be assigned to one or more Roles. To create a Custom Permission, you must first create a Role (e.g. sales) and a Feature within that Role (e.g. invoices). Once both exist, you can define specific Permissions (e.g. create) related to that Feature. To assign a Custom Permission to a user, you must assign the user to the Role that has the Permission.\n\nTo create a new Permission:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nCreate a new Role or use an existing Role from the list.\nUnder Custom permissions, select Create permission under the Feature you want to create the Permission for. If there are no Features, you'll need to create a new one first. Select Create feature and fill in the required fields. Once finished, the newly created Feature will appear in the list, and the Create permission button will appear.\nGive the Permission a name, a key to reference it by, and a description. The final key will follow the format org:<feature>:<permission>.\n\nNote\n\nCommon Permission values could be:\n\ncreate — to allow creating resources\nread — to allow reading/viewing resources\nupdate/manage — to allow updating/editing resources\ndelete — to allow deleting resources\n\nFor example, you could create a new Permission called Create invoices (org:invoices:create) which allows only users with this Permission to edit invoices. Then, you could assign this Permission to a Role, or multiple Roles, such as Billing (org:billing) or Sales (org:sales).\n\nSelect Create permission.\n\nYou can also create a Custom Permission by navigating to the Features⁠ tab in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nVerify a user's Role or Permission\n\nIt's best practice to always verify whether or not a user is authorized to access sensitive information, important content, or exclusive features. Authorization is the process of determining the access rights and privileges of a user, ensuring they have the necessary Permissions to perform specific actions. To perform authorization checks using a user's Role or Permission, see the guide on authorizing users.\n\nNext steps\n\nNow that you've set up Roles and Permissions, you can:\n\nConfigure and assign Role Sets\n\nLearn how to configure and assign Role Sets to control which Roles are available to specific Organizations.\n\nPerform authorization checks\n\nLearn how to perform authorization checks to limit access to content or entire routes based on a user's Role or Permissions.\n\nConfigure Verified Domains\n\nLearn how to automatically invite users to an Organization based on their email domain.\n\nAdd members to your Organization\n\nLearn how to add members to your Organization with invitations.\n\nSet up Enterprise SSO Connections\n\nLearn how to automatically add users to an Organization through Enterprise SSO.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

See the pricing⁠ page for more information.\n\nRole Sets are collections of available Roles you can assign to members in an Organization. This lets you control role availability on a per-organization basis - if a Role isn't in an Organization's Role Set, members of that Organization can't be assigned to that Role.\n\nWhen you create an Organization, it's automatically assigned to the Default Role Set. By default, this is set to Clerk's Primary Role Set, which includes the admin and member Roles. The Primary Role Set is free and can be modified to fit your needs. To create additional Role Sets with different combinations of Roles, you'll need the Enhanced B2B Authentication add-on⁠.\n\nWhen you modify a Role Set, the changes are automatically applied to all Organizations using it. This makes it easy to roll out new Roles across multiple Organizations at once.\n\nWhen to use Role Sets\n\nUse Role Sets when different Organizations need different available Roles. This works well for:\n\nDifferent pricing tiers - Your Free plan offers only admin and member, Pro adds moderator and analyst, and Enterprise adds security_admin and compliance_officer.\nDifferent customer cohorts - Small practices get physician and nurse, while large hospitals also get department_head and specialist. All cohorts share admin and member, but get additional Roles specific to their size.\n\nIf all Organizations need the same custom Roles, just modify the Primary Role Set instead. Refer to Roles and Permissions to learn how.\n\nPrimary Role Set\n\nThe Primary Role Set is Clerk's default Role Set. It includes:\n\nAdmin (org:admin) - Full access to Organization resources and management\nMember (org:member) - Limited access to Organization resources\n\nYou can add or remove Roles from it. If you remove a Role that members have, you'll go through the remapping flow.\n\nDefault Role Set\n\nThe Default Role Set determines which Role Set is automatically assigned to new Organizations. By default, this is configured to use the Primary Role Set, but you can change it to any other Role Set you've created.\n\nTo configure the Default Role Set:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nSelect the three dots next to the Role Set you want to set as default.\nFrom the dropdown, select the Set as default role set option.\nConfirm your changes.\n\nNote\n\nThis only affects new Organizations. Existing Organizations keep their current Role Set unless you manually change them.\n\nCreate a Role Set\n\nTo create additional Role Sets beyond the Primary Role Set, you'll need the Enhanced B2B Authentication add-on⁠.\n\nTo create a Role Set:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nSelect Create role set.\nGive the Role Set a name, a key to reference it by, and a description.\nUnder Roles, click Add Roles. You can select from a list of global Roles or create new ones. You must also select a Organization creator role and a New member default role.\nSelect Save.\nAssign a Role Set to an Organization\n\nYou can assign a different Role Set to an organization to change which Roles are available to its members.\n\nTo assign a Role Set:\n\nNavigate to Organizations⁠ in the Clerk Dashboard and select an Organization.\nSelect the Settings tab.\nUnder Roles, you'll see the current Role Set (the Primary Role Set by default).\nChoose a new Role Set from the dropdown.\nIf members have Roles that don't exist in the new set, you'll go through the remapping flow.\nSelect Confirm.\nEdit a Role Set\n\nWhen you edit a Role Set, the changes are automatically applied to all Organizations using it.\n\nTo edit a Role Set:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nSelect the Role Set you want to edit.\n\nTo add Roles, click Add Roles. You can select from a list of global Roles or create new ones. You must also select a Organization creator role and a New member default role.\n\nTo remove Roles, click on the three dots next to a Role and select Remove role. Confirm this change by typing the role name and clicking Next. If you remove a Role that members have, you will go through the remapping flow. If you delete a default Role, the reassigned Role will be the new default Role.\n\nWarning\n\nRemoving a Role affects all Organizations using that Role Set. To remove a Role from just one Organization, create a new Role Set for it instead.\n\nDelete a Role Set\n\nTo delete a Role Set:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Roles & Permissions⁠.\nSelect the Role sets tab.\nSelect the three dots next to the Role Set.\nSelect Delete role set.\nIf Organizations are using this Role Set, you'll be prompted to select a replacement Role Set for them. You will go through the remapping flow.\nConfirm by typing the Role Set key.\nRemapping flow\n\nIf you modify a Role that members have, you'll be prompted to select a replacement Role. This happens when you:\n\nChange an Organization's Role Set to one that doesn't include all current Roles.\nRemove a Role from a Role Set that members have.\nDelete a Role Set assigned to an Organization.

These checks are essential for protecting sensitive data, gating premium features, and ensuring users stay within their allowed scope of access.\n\nWithin Organizations, authorization checks can be performed by checking a user's Roles or Custom Permissions. Roles like org:admin determine a user's level of access within an Organization, while Custom Permissions like org:invoices:create provide fine-grained control over specific features and actions.\n\nExamples\n\nFor examples on how to perform authorization checks, see the guide on authorization checks.\n\nClient-side\nServer-side\n\nYou can protect content and even entire routes based on Organization membership, Roles, and Permissions by performing authorization checks⁠.\n\nIn the following example, the page is restricted to authenticated users, users who have the org:admin Role, and users who belong to the Acme Corp Organization.\n\nThe Auth object is used to access the isSignedIn property and has() method.\nThe isSignedIn property is used to check if the user is signed in.\nThe has() method is used to check if the user has the org:admin Role.\nThe \nuseOrganization()\n hook is used to access the organization data.\nThe Organization name is checked to ensure it matches the required Organization name. If a user is not in the required Organization, the page will display a message and the \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n component will be rendered to allow the user to switch to the required Organization.\napp/protected/page.tsx\n'use client'\nimport { OrganizationSwitcher, useAuth, useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  // The `useAuth()` hook gives you access to properties like `isSignedIn` and `has()`\n  const { isSignedIn, has } = useAuth()\n  const { organization } = useOrganization()\n\n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!isSignedIn) {\n    return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>\n  }\n\n  // Check if there is an Active Organization\n  if (!organization) {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>\n        <OrganizationSwitcher />\n      </>\n    )\n  }\n\n  // Check if the user has the `org:admin` Role\n  if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) {\n    return <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>\n  }\n\n  // Check if Organization name matches (e.g., \"Acme Corp\")\n  const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'\n  if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName) {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <p>\n          This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization.\n          Switch to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization to access this page.\n        </p>\n        <OrganizationSwitcher />\n      </>\n    )\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <p>\n      You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}\n      <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization.\n    </p>\n  )\n}\n\nFor more examples on how to perform authorization checks, see the dedicated guide.\n\nNext steps\n\nNow that you know how to check Roles and Permissions, you can:\n\nPerform authorization checks\n\nLearn how to perform authorization checks to limit access to content or entire routes based on a user's Role or Permissions.\n\nFeatures and Plans\n\nLearn how to check Features and Plans for Subscription-based applications.\n\nSet up Roles and Permissions\n\nLearn how to set up Roles and Permissions to control what invited users can access.\n\nConfigure default Roles\n\nLearn how to configure default Roles for new Organization members.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This is useful for advanced user segmentation, analytics, or storing application-specific data like subscription tier, department, or region.\n\nMetadata is stored on the Organization and OrganizationMembership objects.\n\nTypes of metadata\n\nThere are two types of Organization metadata: public and private.\n\nMetadata\tFrontend API\tBackend API\nPublic\tRead access\tRead & write access\nPrivate\tNo read or write access\tRead & write access\n\nBoth the Organization and OrganizationMembership objects have the metadata fields: publicMetadata and privateMetadata.\n\nUse the publicMetadata property if you need to set some metadata from your backend and have them displayed as read-only on the frontend.\nUse the privateMetadata property if the custom attributes contain sensitive information that should not be displayed on the frontend.\nSet Organization metadata\n\nYou can set Organization metadata in the Clerk Dashboard⁠ or using Clerk's Backend API. See the updateOrganizationMetadata() and updateOrganizationMembershipMetadata() methods for more information.\n\nAccess public metadata\n\nTo access public metadata on the frontend, it's available on the Organization object, which can be accessed using the \nuseOrganization()\n hook.\n\nTo access public metadata on the backend, it's available on the Backend Organization object which can be accessed using the getOrganization() method. This method will return the Organization object which contains the public metadata. However, this method is subject to rate limits, so if you are accessing the metadata frequently, it's recommended to attach it to the user's session token.\n\nMetadata in the session token\n\nRetrieving metadata from the Organization or OrganizationMembership objects on the server-side requires making an API request to Clerk's Backend API, which is slower and is subject to rate limits. You can store it in the user's session token, which doesn't require making an API request as it's available on the user's authentication context. However, there is a size limitation to keep in mind. Clerk stores the session token in a cookie, and most browsers cap cookie size at 4KB⁠. After accounting for the size of Clerk's default claims, the cookie can support up to 1.2KB of custom claims. Exceeding this limit will cause the cookie to not be set, which will break your app as Clerk depends on cookies to work properly.\n\nIf you need to store more than 1.2KB of metadata, you should store the extra data in your own database instead. If this isn't an option, you can move particularly large claims out of the token and fetch them using a separate API call from your backend, but this approach brings back the issue of making an API request to Clerk's Backend API, which is slower and is subject to rate limits.\n\nAnother limitation of storing metadata in the session token is that when you modify metadata server-side, the changes won't appear in the session token until the next refresh. To avoid race conditions, either force a JWT refresh after metadata changes or handle the delay in your application logic.\n\nIf you've considered the limitations, and you still want to store metadata in the session token:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\nUnder Customize session token, in the Claims editor, you can add any claim to your session token that you need and select Save. To avoid exceeding the session token's 1.2KB limit, it's not recommended to add the entire organization.public_metadata or organization_membership.public_metadata object. Instead, add individual fields as claims, like organization.public_metadata.birthday. When doing this, it's recommended to leave particularly large claims out of the token to avoid exceeding the session token's size limit. See the example for more information.\nNext steps\n\nNow that you understand Organization metadata, you can:\n\nAdd metadata to invitations\n\nLearn how to add metadata to invitations to track invitation sources or assign attributes.\n\nCreate and manage Organizations\n\nLearn how to create and manage Organizations to see metadata in action.\n\nControl access based on Roles and Permissions\n\nLearn how to configure access control with Custom Roles and Permissions.\n\nUse Organization slugs in URLs\n\nLearn how to use Organization slugs in URLs for tenant-specific routing.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

A common pattern for Organization-scoped areas in an application is to include the Organization slug in the URL path, making links sharable and providing clear context about which tenant the page belongs to.\n\nFor example, a B2B application named \"Petstore\" has two customer Organizations: Acmecorp and Widgetco. Each Organization uses its name as a slug in the URL:\n\nAcmecorp: https://petstore.example.com/orgs/acmecorp/dashboard\nWidgetco: https://petstore.example.com/orgs/widgetco/dashboard\n\nAlternatively, Organization IDs can be used to identify Organizations in URLs:\n\nAcmecorp: https://petstore.example.com/orgs/org_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8e/dashboard\nWidgetco: https://petstore.example.com/orgs/org_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8f/dashboard\nWhen to use Organization slugs\n\nThis feature is intended for apps that require Organization slugs in URLs. We don't recommend adding slugs to URLs unless necessary.\n\nUse Organization slugs if:\n\nUsers frequently share links for public-facing content (e.g., documentation, marketing materials, and third-party blogs).\nUsers regularly switch between multiple Organizations.\nOrganization-specific URLs provide meaningful context.\n\nDon't use Organization slugs if:\n\nMost users belong to only one Organization.\nYou want to keep URLs simple and consistent.\nYou're primarily using the Clerk session for Organization context.\n\nThis guide shows you how to add Organization slugs to your app's URLs, configure Clerk components to handle slug-based navigation, and access Organization data based on the URL slug at runtime.\n\nConfigure <OrganizationSwitcher /> and <OrganizationList />\n\nThe \n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n and \n<OrganizationList />\n components provide a robust set of options to manage Organization slugs and IDs in your application's URLs.\n\nSet the following properties to configure the components to handle slug-based navigation:\n\nSet hideSlug to false to allow users to customize the Organization's URL slug when creating an Organization.\nSet afterCreateOrganizationUrl to /orgs/:slug to navigate the user to the Organization's slug after creating an Organization.\nSet afterSelectOrganizationUrl to /orgs/:slug to navigate the user to the Organization's slug after selecting it.\n\nFor example, if the Organization has the slug acmecorp, when a user creates or selects that Organization using either component, they'll be redirected to /orgs/acmecorp.\n\n<OrganizationSwitcher />\n<OrganizationList />\ncomponents/Header.tsx\nimport { OrganizationSwitcher } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function Header() {\n  return (\n    <OrganizationSwitcher\n      hideSlug={false} // Allow users to customize the org's URL slug\n      afterCreateOrganizationUrl=\"/orgs/:slug\" // Navigate to the org's slug after creating an org\n      afterSelectOrganizationUrl=\"/orgs/:slug\" // Navigate to the org's slug after selecting  it\n    />\n  )\n}\nConfigure clerkMiddleware() to set the Active Organization\n\nTip\n\nIf your app doesn't use clerkMiddleware(), or you prefer to manually set the Active Organization⁠, use the setActive() method to control the Active Organization on the client-side.\n\nWith \nclerkMiddleware()\n, you can use the \norganizationSyncOptions\n property to declare URL patterns that determine whether a specific Organization should be activated.\n\nIf the middleware detects one of these patterns in the URL and finds that a different Organization is active in the session, it'll attempt to set the specified Organization as the active one.\n\nIn the following example, two organizationPatterns are defined: one for the root (e.g., /orgs/acmecorp) and one as the wildcard matcher (.*) to match /orgs/acmecorp/any/other/resource. This configuration ensures that the path /orgs/:slug with any optional trailing path segments will set the Organization indicated by the slug as the active one.\n\nWarning\n\nIf no Organization with the specified slug exists, or if the user isn't a member of the Organization, then clerkMiddleware() won't modify the Active Organization. Instead, it will leave the previously Active Organization unchanged on the Clerk session.\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware(\n  (auth, req) => {\n    // Add your middleware checks\n  },\n  {\n    organizationSyncOptions: {\n      organizationPatterns: [\n        '/orgs/:slug', // Match the org slug\n        '/orgs/:slug/(.*)', // Wildcard match for optional trailing path segments\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n)\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params\n    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',\n    // Always run for API routes\n    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',\n  ],\n}\nHandle failed activation\n\nNow that clerkMiddleware() is configured to activate Organizations, you can build an Organization-specific page while handling cases where the Organization can't be activated.\n\nFailed activation occurs if no Organization with the specified slug exists, or if the given user isn't a member of the Organization. When this happens, the middleware won't change the Active Organization, leaving the previously active one unchanged.\n\nFor troubleshooting, Clerk will also log a message on the server:\n\nClerk: Organization activation handshake loop detected. This is likely due to an invalid Organization ID or slug. Skipping Organization activation.\n\nIt's ultimately the responsibility of the page to ensure that it renders the appropriate content for a given URL, and to handle the case where the expected Organization isn't active.\n\nIn the following example, the Organization slug is detected as a Next.js Dynamic Route⁠ param and passed as a parameter to the page. If the slug doesn't match the Active Organization slug, an error message is rendered and the \n<OrganizationList />\n component allows the user to select a valid Organization.\n\napp/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\nimport { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default async function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const { orgSlug } = await auth()\n  const { slug } = await params\n\n  // Check if the org slug from the URL params doesn't match\n  // the active org slug from the user's session.\n  // If they don't match, show an error message and the list of valid Organizations.\n  if (slug != orgSlug) {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <p>Sorry, Organization {slug} is not valid.</p>\n        <OrganizationList\n          hideSlug={false}\n          afterCreateOrganizationUrl=\"/orgs/:slug\"\n          afterSelectOrganizationUrl=\"/orgs/:slug\"\n        />\n      </>\n    )\n  }\n\n  return <div>Welcome to Organization {orgSlug}</div>\n}\nRender Organization-specific content\n\nUse the following tabs to learn how to access Organization information on the server-side and client-side.\n\nServer-side\nClient-side\n\nTo get Organization information on the server-side, access the Auth object which includes the active org's orgId and orgSlug and the current user's orgRole and orgPermissions. To access additional Organization information server-side, like the Organization name, you can store the additional information in the user's session token. To customize the session token, do the following:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\n\nUnder Customize session token, in the Claims editor, add any claim you need to your session token. For this guide, add the following claim:\n\n{\n  \"org_name\": \"{{org.name}}\"\n}\n\nSelect Save.\n\nNow that you've added the claim to the session token, you can access it from the sessionClaims property on the Auth object.\n\napp/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\nimport { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default async function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const { orgSlug, sessionClaims } = await auth()\n  const { slug } = await params\n\n  // Check if the org slug from the URL params doesn't match\n  // the active org slug from the user's session.\n  // If they don't match, show an error message and the list of valid Organizations.\n  if (slug != orgSlug) {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <p>Sorry, Organization {slug} is not valid.</p>\n        <OrganizationList\n          hideSlug={false}\n          afterCreateOrganizationUrl=\"/orgs/:slug\"\n          afterSelectOrganizationUrl=\"/orgs/:slug\"\n        />\n      </>\n    )\n  }\n\n  // Access the org name from the session claims\n  let orgId = sessionClaims['org_id'] as string\n\n  return <div>{orgId && `Welcome to organization ${orgId}`}</div>\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To mitigate potential disruptions, we recommend pinning your SDK and clerk-js package versions.\n\nClerk Billing for B2C SaaS allows you to create Plans and manage Subscriptions for individual users in your application. If you'd like to charge companies or organizations, see \nBilling for B2B SaaS\n. You can also combine both B2C and B2B Billing in the same application.\n\nEnable Billing\n\nTo enable Billing for your application, navigate to the Billing Settings⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. This page will guide you through enabling Billing for your application.\n\nClerk Billing costs the same as using Stripe Billing directly, just 0.7% per transaction, plus transaction fees which are paid directly to Stripe. Clerk Billing is not the same as Stripe Billing. Plans and pricing are managed directly through the Clerk Dashboard and won't sync with your existing Stripe products or plans. Clerk uses Stripe only for payment processing, so you don't need to set up Stripe Billing.\n\nPayment gateway\n\nOnce you have enabled Billing, you will see the following Payment gateway options for collecting payments via Stripe:\n\nClerk development gateway: A shared test Stripe account used for development instances. This allows developers to test and build Billing flows in development without needing to create and configure a Stripe account.\nStripe account: Use your own Stripe account for production. A Stripe account created for a development instance cannot be used for production. You will need to create a separate Stripe account for your production environment.\nCreate a Plan\n\nSubscription Plans are what your users subscribe to. There is no limit to the number of Plans you can create.\n\nTo create a Plan, navigate to the Subscription plans⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Here, you can create, edit, and delete Plans. To setup B2C Billing, select the Plans for Users tab and select Add Plan. When creating a Plan, you can also create Features for the Plan; see the next section for more information.\n\nTip\n\nWhat is the Publicly available option?\n\nShow details\nAdd Features to a Plan\n\nFeatures make it easy to give entitlements to your Plans. You can add any number of Features to a Plan.\n\nYou can add a Feature to a Plan when you are creating a Plan. To add it after a Plan is created:\n\nNavigate to the Subscription plans⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nSelect the Plan you'd like to add a Feature to.\nIn the Features section, select Add Feature.\n\nTip\n\nWhat is the Publicly available option?\n\nShow details\nCreate a pricing page\n\nYou can create a pricing page by using the \n<PricingTable />\n component. This component displays a table of Plans and Features that users can subscribe to. It's recommended to create a dedicated page, as shown in the following example.\n\napp/routes/pricing.tsx\nimport { PricingTable } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: PricingPage,\n})\n\nfunction PricingPage() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', margin: '0 auto', padding: '0 1rem' }}>\n      <PricingTable />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nControl access with Features and Plans\n\nYou can use Clerk's Features and Plans to gate access to the content. There are a few ways to do this, but the recommended approach is to either use the \nhas()\n method or the \n<Protect>\n component.\n\nThe has() method is available for any JavaScript framework, while <Protect> is only available for React-based frameworks.\n\nExample: Using has()\n\nUse the has() method to test if the user has access to a Plan:\n\nconst hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'gold' })\n\nOr a Feature:\n\nconst hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'widgets' })\n\nThe \nhas()\n method is a server-side helper that checks if the Organization has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan) and returns a boolean value. has() is available on the \nauth object\n, which you will access differently \ndepending on the framework you are using\n.\n\nPlan\nFeature\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use has() to check if a user has a Plan.\n\napp/routes/bronze-content.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nexport const authStateFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {\n  const { has, userId } = await auth()\n\n  return {\n    userId,\n    hasBronzePlan: has({ plan: 'bronze' }),\n  }\n})\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/bronze-content')({\n  component: BronzeContentPage,\n  beforeLoad: async () => {\n    const authObject = await authStateFn()\n    return {\n      userId: authObject.userId,\n      hasBronzePlan: authObject.hasBronzePlan,\n    }\n  },\n})\n\nfunction BronzeContentPage() {\n  const { hasBronzePlan } = Route.useRouteContext()\n\n  if (!hasBronzePlan) return <h1>Only subscribers to the Bronze plan can access this content.</h1>\n\n  return <h1>For Bronze subscribers only</h1>\n}\nExample: Using <Protect>\n\nThe \n<Protect>\n component protects content or even entire routes by checking if the user has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan).

To mitigate potential disruptions, we recommend pinning your SDK and clerk-js package versions.\n\nClerk Billing for B2B SaaS allows you to create Plans and manage Subscriptions for companies or organizations in your application. If you'd like to charge individual users, see \nBilling for B2C SaaS\n. You can also combine both B2C and B2B Billing in the same application.\n\nEnable Billing\n\nTo enable Billing for your application, navigate to the Billing Settings⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. This page will guide you through enabling Billing for your application.\n\nClerk Billing costs the same as using Stripe Billing directly, just 0.7% per transaction, plus transaction fees which are paid directly to Stripe. Clerk Billing is not the same as Stripe Billing. Plans and pricing are managed directly through the Clerk Dashboard and won't sync with your existing Stripe products or plans. Clerk uses Stripe only for payment processing, so you don't need to set up Stripe Billing.\n\nPayment gateway\n\nOnce you have enabled Billing, you will see the following Payment gateway options for collecting payments via Stripe:\n\nClerk development gateway: A shared test Stripe account used for development instances. This allows developers to test and build Billing flows in development without needing to create and configure a Stripe account.\nStripe account: Use your own Stripe account for production. A Stripe account created for a development instance cannot be used for production. You will need to create a separate Stripe account for your production environment.\nCreate a Plan\n\nSubscription Plans are what your customers subscribe to. There is no limit to the number of Plans you can create. If your Clerk instance has existing Custom Permissions, the corresponding Features from those Permissions will automatically be added to the Free Plan for Organizations. This ensures that Organization members get the same set of Custom Permissions when Billing is enabled, because all Organizations start on the Free Plan.\n\nTo create a Plan, navigate to the Subscription plans⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Here, you can create, edit, and delete Plans. To setup B2B Billing, select the Plans for Organizations tab and select Add Plan. When creating a Plan, you can also create Features for the Plan; see the next section for more information.\n\nTip\n\nWhat is the Publicly available option?\n\nShow details\nAdd Features to a Plan\n\nFeatures make it easy to give entitlements to your Plans. You can add any number of Features to a Plan.\n\nYou can add a Feature to a Plan when you are creating a Plan. To add it after a Plan is created:\n\nNavigate to the Subscription plans⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nSelect the Plan you'd like to add a Feature to.\nIn the Features section, select Add Feature.\n\nTip\n\nWhat is the Publicly available option?\n\nShow details\nCreate a pricing page\n\nYou can create a pricing page by using the \n<PricingTable />\n component. This component displays a table of Plans and Features that customers can subscribe to. It's recommended to create a dedicated page, as shown in the following example.\n\napp/routes/pricing.tsx\nimport { PricingTable } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: PricingPage,\n})\n\nfunction PricingPage() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', margin: '0 auto', padding: '0 1rem' }}>\n      <PricingTable for=\"organization\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nControl access with Features, Plans, and Permissions\n\nYou can use Clerk's Features, Plans, and Permissions to gate access to content using authorization checks⁠. There are a few ways to do this, but the recommended approach is to either use the \nhas()\n method or the \n<Protect>\n component.\n\nThe has() method is available for any JavaScript-based framework, while <Protect> is a component, and therefore, is only available for React-based frameworks.\n\nImportant\n\nPermission-based authorization checks link with Feature-based authorization checks. This means that if you are checking a Custom Permission, it will only work if the Feature part of the Permission key (org:<feature>:<permission>) is a Feature included in the Organization's active Plan. For example, say you want to check if an Organization member has the Custom Permission org:teams:manage, where teams is the Feature. Before performing the authorization check, you need to ensure that the user's Organization is subscribed to a Plan that has the teams Feature. If the user's Organization is not subscribed to a Plan that has the teams Feature, the authorization check will always return false, even if the user has the Custom Permission.\n\nExample: Using has()\n\nUse the has() method to test if the Organization has access to a Plan:\n\nconst hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'gold' })\n\nOr a Feature:\n\nconst hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'widgets' })\n\nThe \nhas()\n method is a server-side helper that checks if the Organization has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan) and returns a boolean value. has() is available on the \nauth object\n, which you will access differently \ndepending on the framework you are using\n.\n\nTip\n\nWhy aren't Custom Permissions appearing in the session token (JWT) or in API responses (including the result of the has() check)?\n\nShow details\nPlan\nFeature\nPermission\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use has() to check if an Organization has a Plan.\n\napp/routes/bronze-content.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nexport const authStateFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {\n  const { has, userId } = await auth()\n\n  return {\n    userId,\n    hasBronzePlan: has({ plan: 'bronze' }),\n  }\n})\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/bronze-content')({\n  component: BronzeContentPage,\n  beforeLoad: async () => {\n    const authObject = await authStateFn()\n    return {\n      userId: authObject.userId,\n      hasBronzePlan: authObject.hasBronzePlan,\n    }\n  },\n})\n\nfunction BronzeContentPage() {\n  const { hasBronzePlan } = Route.useRouteContext()\n\n  if (!hasBronzePlan) return <h1>Only subscribers to the Bronze plan can access this content.</h1>\n\n  return <h1>For Bronze subscribers only</h1>\n}\nExample: Using <Protect>\n\nThe \n<Protect>\n component protects content or even entire routes by checking if the Organization has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan). You can pass a fallback prop to <Protect> that will be rendered if the Organization does not have the access control.\n\nPlan\nFeature\nPermission\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use <Protect> to protect a page by checking if the Organization has a Plan.\n\napp/routes/protected-content.tsx\nimport { Protect } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/protected-content')({\n  component: ProtectedContentPage,\n})\n\nfunction ProtectedContentPage() {\n  return (\n    <Protect\n      plan=\"bronze\"\n      fallback={<p>Only subscribers to the Bronze plan can access this content.</p>}\n    >\n      <h1>Exclusive Bronze Content</h1>\n      <p>This content is only visible to Bronze subscribers.</p>\n    </Protect>\n  )\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To mitigate potential disruptions, we recommend pinning your SDK and clerk-js package versions.\n\nClerk Billing allows your customers to purchase recurring Subscriptions to your application. To get started, choose one or combine both of the following business models depending on your application's needs.\n\nBilling for B2C SaaS\n\nTo charge individual users\n\nBilling for B2B SaaS\n\nTo charge companies or organizations\n\nWebhooks\n\nTo track Subscription lifecycles and monitor payment attempts\n\nBuild a simple checkout page\n\nTo charge users with a new payment method\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\nCan I use an existing Stripe account with Clerk Billing?\n\nYes, you can. However, it must not already be linked to another platform.\n\nCan I see Subscriptions in my Stripe account?\n\nClerk Billing only uses Stripe for payment processing. You can see payment and customer information in Stripe. However, Clerk Billing is a separate product from Stripe Billing; Plans and Subscriptions made in Clerk are not synced to Stripe.\n\nCan I use the same Stripe account for both dev and prod environments?\n\nNo. Stripe accounts created for development instances are sandbox/test accounts and cannot be used for production. For a production environment, you must create a separate Stripe account.\n\nDoes Clerk Billing support refunds?\n\nNo, Clerk Billing does not support refunds at this time. You can still issue a refund through your Stripe account. Please note that refunds performed in Stripe will not be reflected in income/MRR calculations.\n\nIs Clerk a Merchant of Record (MoR) for transactions?\n\nNo, Clerk does not provide this service.\n\nDoes Clerk Billing support non-USD currencies?\n\nClerk Billing currently supports only USD as the billing currency. While you can connect both US and non-US Stripe accounts, all payments will be processed in USD regardless of your Stripe account's local currency. For information about Stripe's supported countries and currencies, see Stripe Global⁠. Support for additional currencies is on our roadmap.\n\nWhat third-party tools does Clerk Billing integrate with?\n\nNone directly, but since payments are processed through Stripe, you can use any third-party tool that integrates with Stripe for analytics, reporting, invoicing, or tax compliance.\n\nCan I offer custom pricing plans to specific customers?\n\nYes, Clerk Billing supports custom pricing plans. See Custom Plans and prices for more information.\n\nCan I let users upgrade or downgrade their plans mid-cycle?\n\nYes. Plan upgrades will take effect immediately, while downgrades take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.\n\nDoes Clerk Billing support annual Subscriptions?\n\nYes, you can offer subscribers the option to pay annually, at a discounted monthly price. Annual pricing for your plans can be configured from the Subscription plans⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Customers can choose between monthly or annual billing when subscribing.\n\nHow does Clerk handle taxes and VAT for international billing?\n\nClerk Billing does not currently support tax or VAT, but these are planned for future releases.\n\nHow can I test failure scenarios like expired cards or canceled Subscriptions?\n\nYou can simulate failures in Stripe test mode using test cards that trigger specific behaviors. See Stripe Testing⁠ for a list of test cards and behaviors.\n\nWhich countries is Clerk Billing not supported in?\n\nClerk Billing is not supported in Brazil, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and Thailand due to payment processing restrictions⁠. Support may be added in the future. For all other regions, availability depends on Stripe - see Stripe Global⁠ for the full list.\n\nDoes Clerk Billing support additional factor authentication like 3D Secure?\n\nClerk Billing does not currently support additional factor authentication. Users will receive an error indicating that the provided payment method requires additional confirmation, which Clerk Billing does not support, and will be asked to use a different payment method.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

With Clerk Billing, you can turn on free trials for any Plan, or set the same trial period across all your Plans.\n\nEnable free trials\n\nTo enable free trials for your Plans:\n\nNavigate to the Subscription plans⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nSelect the Plan you want to enable free trials on.\nEnable Free trial and set the number of trial days (minimum is 1 day).\nWhat your users experience\nStarting a trial\n\nOnly users who have never paid for a Subscription and have never used a free trial can start a free trial.\n\nA credit card is required to start a free trial. This helps prevent abuse and ensures a smooth transition to paid service when the trial ends.\n\nDuring a trial\n\nUsers get access to the Plan's paid Features for the configured number of days. If they cancel during their trial, they keep access until the original trial end date.\n\nWhen the trial ends\n\nIf the user didn't cancel their Subscription during the trial, they are charged using their default payment method on file. This may be a different payment method than the one used during checkout when the trial started.\n\nIf the user cancels their Subscription during the trial, they lose access at the end of the trial and are moved back to the free Plan. They are not charged.\n\nBoth you and your users will receive notifications when a trial is about to expire:\n\nYou'll receive a subscriptionItem.freeTrialEnding webhook event 3 days before the trial expires.\nUsers receive an email notification 3 days before their trial expires.\n\nIf the trial period is shorter than 3 days, these notifications are sent immediately when the trial begins.\n\nManage trials\n\nYou can manually change the duration of a user's trial:\n\nCancel at the end of the trial: Cancel the trial while allowing the user to keep access to the paid Features until the trial period ends. This prevents their default payment method from being charged when the trial period ends.\nEnd immediately: Immediately move the user back to the free Plan and terminate their access to the paid Features they were trialing.\nExtend a trial: Make a user's trial last longer. You must extend a trial by at least 1 day and no more than 365 days.\n\nYou can only manage the trial of a user while the trial is active. Once a trial ends, you can no longer extend or cancel it.\n\nTo manage a trial for a Subscription:\n\nNavigate to the Billing⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nSelect the user whose trial you want to manage.\nUnder Subscriptions, select the ... menu to see the available actions for managing the trial.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

You can switch a customer's Subscription Item from one price to another while maintaining a smooth billing experience — whether you're upgrading them from free to paid, moving between paid tiers, or applying custom pricing.\n\nUse cases\n\nThis Subscription management feature simplifies essential Billing workflows:\n\nPromotional offers - Apply special pricing to existing subscribers.\nTiered upgrades and downgrades - Move customers between different paid Plans based on their needs or usage.\nPlan migrations - Transition customers to new pricing structures as your product evolves.\nUpdate Subscription Plans or prices\n\nYou can update the price or Plan of an existing Subscription Item in the Clerk Dashboard or using the Backend API.\n\nUsing the Clerk Dashboard\n\nTo change the price or Plan of an existing Subscription Item:\n\nNavigate to the Billing⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nUnder Subscription activity, select the subscriber whose plan or pricing you want to update.\nSelect the ... menu next to the Subscription Item you want to update.\nChoose Change price or Change plan as needed.\n\nIf none of the existing pricing options meet your needs, you can create a custom price:\n\nWhen updating a Subscription Item, select Create new price.\nConfigure the pricing details.\nUse the new price immediately for your Subscription transition.\n\nThis is useful for creating one-off pricing arrangements for specific customers.\n\nUsing the Backend API\n\nUsing the Backend API to transition Subscription Items is useful for automating Plan changes or building custom billing workflows.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to transition a Subscription Item from one price to another using a cURL command.\n\nReplace YOUR_SECRET_KEY with your Clerk Secret Key⁠.\nReplace the subi_123 with the ID of the Subscription Item you want to transition.\nReplace the cprice_123 with the ID of the price you want to transition from.\nReplace the cprice_456 with the ID of the price you want to transition to.\ncurl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/billing/subscription_items/{subi_123}/price_transition' \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \\\n  --data '{\n  \"from_price_id\": \"cprice_123\",\n  \"to_price_id\": \"cprice_456\"\n}'\n\nFor complete API documentation, see the Create price transition endpoint⁠.\n\nHow transitions work\n\nWhen you create a price transition, Clerk handles all the timing and billing logic automatically. The behavior depends on the type of transition:\n\nFree-to-paid transitions\n\nNew customers with no active Subscription\n\nWhen transitioning a customer from free to a paid Plan with no other active Subscription, the paid Plan activates immediately and the customer is charged right away.\n\nExample: Moving a customer on the default Plan to Pro ($50/month). Pro activates immediately, customer is charged $50.\n\nCustomers with a canceled Subscription\n\nCanceled Subscriptions are active Subscriptions that are scheduled to end in the future. When transitioning from free to paid and the customer has a canceled Subscription, the new paid Plan is scheduled as upcoming to avoid billing conflicts.\n\nExample: A customer has an active Pro Subscription (canceled, expires March 20) with the default Plan scheduled as upcoming. When you transition the upcoming default Plan to Enterprise, Enterprise becomes the new upcoming Plan and will activate on March 20 instead of the default Plan.\n\nPaid-to-paid transitions\n\nWhen a customer already has an active paid Subscription, the new Plan is scheduled to start when their current billing period ends to prevent double-billing.\n\nExample: Upgrading a customer from Basic ($20/month, paid through Feb 15) to Enterprise ($35/month) on Jan 15:\n\nBasic remains active through Feb 15 (already paid for)\nEnterprise becomes upcoming and activates Feb 15 (customer is charged then)\nNo double-billing for overlapping periods\nPaid-to-free transitions\n\nWhen transitioning from paid to free, the default Plan is scheduled as upcoming, allowing the customer's current paid Subscription to run through its paid period before automatically activating the default Plan.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To integrate the Account Portal with your application, see the setup guide.\n\nWhy use the Account Portal?\n\nThe Account Portal provides the pages necessary for your users to sign-up, sign-in, and manage their accounts, all while maintaining seamless integration with your application. These pages are hosted on Clerk servers for you and they require minimal setup to get started. If you're looking for the fastest way to add authentication and user management to your application, then this is a great choice.\n\nHowever, if you require more precise customization or prefer having your application self-contained, then you can use Clerk's fully customizable \nprebuilt components\n, or you can build your own custom user interface using the Clerk API.\n\nHow the Account Portal works\n\nThe Account Portal uses Clerk's \nprebuilt components\n, which are embedded into dedicated pages hosted on Clerk servers.\n\nAfter a user has finished their flow in an Account Portal page, Clerk automatically redirects them back to your application along with the required authentication context. This way, users are automatically redirected to and from your application for a seamless experience.\n\nFor each application environment, Clerk provides pages for sign-up, sign-in, user profile, organization profile, and organization creation flow. To integrate the Account Portal into your application, see the setup guide.\n\nCustomizing your pages\n\nThese pages cannot be customized beyond the options provided in the Clerk Dashboard⁠. If you need more customization such as localization, consider using \nprebuilt components\n or building your own custom user interface.\n\nAvailable Account Portal pages\nSign-in\n\nThe sign-in page hosts the prebuilt \n<SignIn />\n component, which renders a UI for signing in users. The functionality of the <SignIn /> component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in the Clerk Dashboard⁠, such as sign-up and sign-in options and social connections. The <SignIn /> component also displays any session tasks⁠ that are required for the user to complete after signing in.\n\nRedirect users to the sign-in page using the \n<RedirectToSignIn />\n control component.\n\nSign-up\n\nThe sign-up page hosts the prebuilt \n<SignUp />\n component, which renders a UI for signing up users. The functionality of the <SignUp /> component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in the Clerk Dashboard⁠, such as sign-up and sign-in options and social connections. The <SignUp /> component also displays any session tasks⁠ that are required for the user to complete after signing up.\n\nRedirect users to the sign-up page using the \n<RedirectToSignUp />\n control component.\n\nUser profile\n\nThe user profile page hosts the prebuilt \n<UserProfile />\n component, which renders a beautiful, full-featured account management UI that allows users to manage their profile and security settings.\n\nRedirect your authenticated users to their user profile page using the \n<RedirectToUserProfile />\n control component.\n\nUnauthorized sign-in\n\nThe unauthorized sign-in page doesn't host any prebuilt Clerk component. It displays a UI confirming that a session from an unrecognized device was successfully revoked. For more information, see the Unauthorized sign-in feature.\n\nThe unauthorized sign-in page displays a UI confirming that a session from an unrecognized device was successfully revoked. For more information, refer to the reference.\n\nCreate Organization\n\nThe create Organization page hosts the prebuilt \n<CreateOrganization />\n component, which provides a streamlined interface for users to create new Organizations within your application.\n\nRedirect your authenticated users to the create Organization page using the \n<RedirectToCreateOrganization />\n control component.\n\nOrganization Profile\n\nThe Organization profile page hosts the prebuilt \n<OrganizationProfile />\n component, which renders a beautiful, full-featured Organization management UI that allows users to manage their Organization profile and security settings.\n\nRedirect your authenticated users to their Organization Profile page using the \n<RedirectToOrganizationProfile />\n control component.\n\nWaitlist\n\nThe waitlist page hosts the prebuilt \n<Waitlist />\n component which renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

After successful authentication, users will be redirected back to your application with an active session.\n\nYou can also integrate the Account Portal into your application using prebuilt components. For example, the \n<SignUpButton>\n and \n<SignInButton>\n components will redirect users to the Account Portal sign-up and sign-in pages if no props or environment variables are configured to override this behavior.\n\nNote\n\nDynamic Development Host Detection\n\nFor development environments, the development host (e.g. http://localhost:3000⁠) is dynamically detected by Clerk at runtime and tied to your client browser. We store this as the 'home origin' for your application and it is equivalent to your application domain in production environments.\n\nAccessing your pages\n\nFor development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on \"accounts.dev\". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:\n\nhttps://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-in\nhttps://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-up\nhttps://accounts.<your-domain>.com/user\nhttps://accounts.<your-domain>.com/unauthorized-sign-in\nhttps://accounts.<your-domain>.com/organization\nhttps://accounts.<your-domain>.com/create-organization\n\nTo access these links, in the Clerk Dashboard, go to the Account Portal⁠ page and then open the Pages tab.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To prevent this, it is recommend that you always specify the redirect in the link when sharing it.\n\nYou can use the following format for your direct links:\n\nhttps://accounts.<your-domain.com>/<account-portal-page>?redirect_url=<your-redirect-url>\n\nExample\n\nhttps://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in?redirect_url=https://myapp.com/dashboard\n\nThe domain is myapp.com, the user is being linked to the sign-in Account Portal page at http://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in and they will be redirected to https://myapp.com/dashboard after they are signed in.\n\nFallback redirects\n\nIn the case that a user does visit an Account Portal page directly without the query param, you can set up fallback redirects to ensure that the user is redirected back to your application after they are finished with their Account Portal flow.\n\nSign-in and sign-up\n\nSet the appropriate environment variables to configure the fallback redirects for sign-in and sign-up.\n\nSign out\n\nSet the post-sign-out redirect by passing the afterSignOutUrl prop to the <ClerkProvider> component. See the \nreference doc\n for more information.\n\nOrganization redirects\n\nBoth the <OrganizationProfile /> and <OrganizationSwitcher /> components accept an afterLeaveOrganizationUrl prop for setting the redirect after leaving an organization.\n\nThe <OrganizationSwitcher /> component accepts an afterSelectOrganizationUrl prop for setting the redirect after selecting an organization, and an afterCreateOrganizationUrl prop for setting the redirect after creating an organization.\n\nPrefill sign in and sign up fields\n\nIn the case of direct links, the values to be used for prefilling the fields for sign-in or sign-up can be specified via the following query parameters:\n\nemail_address\nphone_number\nusername\nfirst_name\nlast_name\n\nFor example, visiting https://accounts.example.com/sign-in?username=nick will result in the username field being prefilled with the value nick.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This guide provides an overview of all available customization options and helps you determine which approach best fits your application.\n\nCustomization layers\n\nImportant\n\nNative applications (iOS and Android) use their own theming and customization system. They use \nClerkTheme\n to control the appearance of Clerk views, allowing you to customize colors, fonts, and other design properties for a consistent visual experience across all screens.\n\nClerk offers a flexible, layered approach to UI customization. Whether you just want to adjust colors and variables or build a fully custom experience using Clerk's headless APIs, you can choose the level of control that fits your needs.\n\nThis section will help you select the right customization layer for your application.\n\nThemes\n\nClerk provides several \nprebuilt themes\n, including a \nshadcn theme\n that adapts Clerk's prebuilt components to match your shadcn styling. All themes are defined through the appearance prop and can be packaged as standalone, shareable theme files. Use themes if you want consistent styling across teams or applications, or when one of Clerk's prebuilt themes already aligns with your brand.\n\nThe appearance prop\n\nThe \nappearance prop\n controls customization of Clerk's prebuilt components. The value of the appearance prop is also the basis of a \nClerk theme\n.\n\nVariables\n\nVariables\n let you customize colors and core design tokens within Clerk's prebuilt components. Choose this option if you like the default UI but only need to make small visual changes.\n\nBring your own CSS\n\nClerk assigns stable CSS classes to most elements, allowing you to style them from your own stylesheet, or by using appearance.elements to apply additional classes and styles. For full control over the look of Clerk's prebuilt components, use the built-in simple theme together with your own custom CSS. For more details, see the \nBring your own CSS\n guide.\n\nBuild your own UI\n\nClerk provides low-level primitives that wrap the same API endpoints used to create Clerk's prebuilt components. These primitives allow you to build fully custom user interfaces from scratch. Prebuilt components are recommended when possible to benefit from ongoing updates and reduced maintenance, but Clerk's APIs and guides are available if you need to build your own UI.\n\nOther customization options\nTheme editor\n\nClerk's theme editor⁠ is an interactive tool that lets you preview and test different Clerk themes across a selection of prebuilt components. It provides a quick way to experiment with styling options and see how each theme affects the component UI in real time.\n\nCustom menu items\n\nClerk's navigation components support adding custom menu items. This allows you to extend the default navigation options with additional custom pages and external links, or adjust the order of existing menu items to better fit your workflow and user experience. This feature is available for the following components:\n\nOrganizationProfile\nUserButton\nUserProfile\nEmail and SMS templates\n\nClerk provides a templating system that allows you to customize the content and styling of email and SMS messages sent to your users. This template editor can also be useful for translating content to different languages or tailoring messages to better fit your brand. For more details, refer to the Email and SMS templates guide\n\nLocalization\n\nClerk's prebuilt components support localization through the localization prop. This prop lets you override any text string in any component, allowing you to translate UI text for your users or adjust wording to better match your application's brand.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Clerk provides a way to customize the appearance of its components using the appearance prop.\n\nThe appearance prop can be used to share styles across every component, or applied individually to any of the Clerk components. When using it for global styling, the prop is available wherever you initialize the Clerk integration. For most SDKs, this means applying it to the \n<ClerkProvider>\n component, while in others, it's configured through the SDK's Clerk integration or plugin.\n\nThis applies to all of the React-based packages, like \nNext.js\n, as well as \nthe pure JavaScript ClerkJS package\n.\n\nProperties\n\nThe appearance prop accepts the following properties:\n\nName\ntheme?\nType\nBaseTheme | BaseTheme[]\nDescription\n\nA theme used as the base theme for the components. For more information, see \nThemes\n.\n\nName\nlayout?\nType\nLayout\nDescription\n\nConfiguration options that affect the layout of the components, allowing customizations that are hard to implement with just CSS.

These features require:\n\ncolor-mix(): Chrome 111+, Firefox 113+, Safari 16.2+\nRelative color syntax: Chrome 119+, Firefox 120+, Safari 16.4+\n\nFor broader browser support, when using the variables prop, use direct color values (e.g. colorPrimary: '#6c47ff') instead of CSS variables or modern color functions.\n\nApply variables to all Clerk components\n\nTo apply variables to all Clerk components, pass the appearance prop to the \n<ClerkProvider>\n component. The appearance prop accepts the property variables.\n\nIn the following example, the primary color is set to blue and the text color is set to black. Since these styles are applied to the SDK's Clerk integration, which wraps the entire application, they will be applied to all Clerk components that use the primary or text color.\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      colorPrimary: '#0000ff', // blue\n      colorForeground: '#000000', // black\n    },\n  }}\n>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\nApply variables to all instances of a Clerk component\n\nTo customize all instances of a Clerk component, you can pass the name of the Clerk component itself to the appearance prop.\n\nIn the following example, the primary color is set to blue and the text color is set to black for all instances of the \n<SignIn />\n component.\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    signIn: {\n      variables: {\n        colorPrimary: '#0000ff', // blue\n        colorForeground: '#000000', // black\n      },\n    },\n  }}\n>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\nApply variables to a single Clerk component\n\nTo customize a single Clerk component, pass the variables property to the appearance prop of the Clerk component.\n\nThe following example shows how to customize the \n<SignIn />\n component by setting the primary color to blue and the text color to black.\n\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      colorPrimary: '#0000ff', // blue\n      colorForeground: '#000000', // black\n    },\n  }}\n/>\nUsing CSS variables\n\nWarning\n\nPlease consider this approach with browser compatibility in mind, as it may not work in older browsers. See \nBrowser Compatibility Considerations\n for details.\n\nYou can also use CSS variables to customize the appearance of Clerk components. This approach is particularly useful when:\n\nYou have a pre-defined design system with CSS custom properties\nYou want to support automatic dark/light mode switching\nYou need to dynamically update colors based on user preferences\nYou're integrating Clerk into an existing application with established CSS variables\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use CSS variables to customize the appearance of Clerk components, but for maximum browser compatibility, it's recommended to use direct color values instead.\n\nUse the following tabs to view the code necessary for each file.\n\nlayout.tsx\nglobal.css\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      colorPrimary: 'var(--brand-primary)',\n    },\n  }}\n>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\nClerk CSS variables\n\nClerk exposes native CSS variables if you would prefer to define variables directly in your application's stylesheet. All variables exposed through the appearance object are also exposed as CSS variables; see the \nproperties\n section for a list of the available variables.\n\nThe Clerk CSS variables are prefixed with clerk- and are in kebab-case:\n\n:root {\n  --clerk-color-primary: #0000ff; /* colorPrimary */\n  --clerk-color-foreground: #000000; /* colorForeground */\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The appearance prop accepts the property theme, which can be set to a theme.\n\nIn the following example, the \"Dark\" theme is applied to all Clerk components.\n\n import { dark } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n <ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n     theme: dark,\n   }}\n >\n   {/* ... */}\n </ClerkProvider>\nApply a theme to all instances of a Clerk component\n\nTo apply a theme to all instances of a Clerk component, you can pass the name of the Clerk component itself to the appearance prop.\n\nIn the following example, the \"Neobrutalism\" theme is applied to all instances of the \n<SignIn />\n component.\n\nimport { dark, neobrutalism } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    theme: dark,\n    signIn: { theme: neobrutalism },\n  }}\n>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\nApply a theme to a single Clerk component\n\nTo apply a theme to a single Clerk component, pass the theme property to the appearance prop of the Clerk component.\n\nIn the following example, the \"Dark\" theme is applied to the \n<SignIn />\n component.\n\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    theme: dark,\n  }}\n/>\nAdvanced usage\nApply multiple themes\n\nYou can also stack themes by passing an array of themes to the theme property of the appearance prop. The themes will be applied in the order they are listed. If styles overlap, the last defined theme will take precedence.\n\nIn the following example, the \"Dark\" theme is applied first, then the \"Neobrutalism\" theme is applied on top of it.\n\n import { dark, neobrutalism } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n <ClerkProvider\n   appearance={{\n     theme: [dark, neobrutalism],\n   }}\n >\n   {/* ... */}\n </ClerkProvider>\nCustomize a theme using variables\n\nYou can customize a theme by passing an object of variables to the variables property of the appearance prop. The variables property is used to adjust the general styles of the component's base theme, like colors, backgrounds, typography.\n\nImportant\n\nFor a list of all of the variables you can customize, and for more examples on how to use the variables property, see the \nVariables\n docs.\n\nIn the following example, the primary color of the themes are customized.\n\nimport { dark, neobrutalism, shadesOfPurple } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    theme: [dark, neobrutalism],\n    variables: { colorPrimary: 'blue' },\n    signIn: {\n      theme: [shadesOfPurple],\n      variables: { colorPrimary: 'green' },\n    },\n  }}\n>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\nAvailable themes\n\nClerk provides six prebuilt themes:\n\nThe default theme\nThe \"Simple\" theme\nThe \"shadcn\" theme\nThe \"Dark\" theme\nThe \"Shades of Purple\" theme\nThe \"Neobrutalism\" theme\n\nTo explore how each theme looks before integrating it into your application, use the Clerk's theme editor, which lets you preview and experiment with themes in real time.\n\nDefault theme\n\nApplied by default when no other theme is provided.\n\n\"Simple\" theme\n\nThis theme is a stripped down \"Default\" theme that removes some more advanced styling techniques, making it easier to apply your own custom styles.\n\nTo use the simple theme, set theme to simple:\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    theme: 'simple',\n  }}\n/>\n\"shadcn\" theme\n\nTo use the shadcn theme, set theme to shadcn:\n\nimport { shadcn } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    theme: shadcn,\n  }}\n/>\n\nImportant\n\nThis theme is compatible with Tailwind CSS v4 usage. If you need support for Tailwind CSS v3, pass the shadcn variables manually to your <ClerkProvider />'s \nvariables\n object.\n\nWhen using the shadcn/ui⁠ library, you can use the shadcn theme to apply the shadcn/ui styles to your Clerk components. This will adapt to both light and dark mode automatically.\n\nImportant\n\nIt's recommended to also import the shadcn.css file within your global.css file. Tailwind scans source files as plain text to detect which classes to generate - classes that only exist in external configurations won't be included in the final CSS.\n\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n@import '@clerk/themes/shadcn.css';\nLight mode\nDark mode\n\"Dark\" theme\n\nTo use the dark theme, set theme to dark:\n\nimport { dark } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    theme: dark,\n  }}\n/>\n\"Shades of purple\" theme\n\nTo use the shades of purple theme, set theme to shadesOfPurple:\n\nimport { shadesOfPurple } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    theme: shadesOfPurple,\n  }}\n/>\n\"Neobrutalism\" theme\n\nTo use the neobrutalism theme, set theme to neobrutalism:\n\nimport { neobrutalism } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    theme: neobrutalism,\n  }}\n/>\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

You can either style using the appearance.elements prop, or target Clerk's stable CSS classes directly in your stylesheet.\n\nApply the simple theme\n\nIn some cases, customizing the default theme of Clerk's components may require complex overrides to achieve your desired styles. To simplify the process, Clerk offers a simple theme that removes advanced styling and provides a clean starting point for further customization. To use the simple theme, apply it using the appearance.theme prop.\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    theme: 'simple',\n  }}\n></ClerkProvider>\nFinding the elements to style\n\nIf you want full control over the appearance of a Clerk component, you can target the underlying elements by using their CSS classes and then apply your own styles.\n\nFirst, you need to identify the underlying element of the Clerk component you want to style. You can do this by inspecting the HTML of the component.\n\nFor example, if you want to style the primary button in a Clerk component, you can right-click on the primary button and select \"Inspect\" from the menu. This will open the browser's developer tools and highlight the element in the HTML, as shown in the following image:\n\nWhen you select an element that is part of a Clerk component, you'll notice a list of classes like so:\n\ncl-formButtonPrimary cl-button 🔒️ cl-internal-1ta0xpz\n\nAny of the classes listed before the lock icon (🔒️) are safe to rely on, such as cl-formButtonPrimary or cl-button from the previous example. You'll use these classes to target elements of the Clerk component.\n\nWarning\n\nAnything after the lock icon (🔒️) are internal classes used for Clerk's internal styling and should not be modified.\n\nOnce you have identified the classes of the element you want to target, you can apply your custom styles in your existing stylesheet, or via the appearance.elements prop.\n\nUse a stylesheet\n\nYou can style the elements of a Clerk component with CSS in your existing stylesheet.\n\nFor this example, say you want to style the primary button in a Clerk component. You inspect the primary button to find the classes that you can use to target the element:\n\ncl-formButtonPrimary cl-button 🔒️ cl-internal-1ta0xpz\n\nYou can then create a CSS file, use the classes you identified to target the primary button, and apply your custom styles. In this case, cl-formButtonPrimary is the class you want to use because it's specific to the primary button:\n\nstyles/global.css\n.cl-formButtonPrimary {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  text-transform: none;\n  background-color: #611bbd;\n}\n\n.cl-formButtonPrimary:hover,\n.cl-formButtonPrimary:focus,\n.cl-formButtonPrimary:active {\n  background-color: #49247a;\n}\nUse custom CSS classes\n\nYou can pass additional classes to Clerk component elements by using the elements property on the appearance prop.\n\nFor example, an element in a Clerk component will have classes that look something like this:\n\ncl-formButtonPrimary cl-button 🔒️ cl-internal-1ta0xpz\n\nRemove the cl- prefix from a class and use it as the key for a new object in the elements property. The value of this object should be the string of classes you want to apply to the element.\n\nThe following example shows how to style the primary button in a <SignIn /> component with custom CSS classes:\n\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      formButtonPrimary: 'your-org-button org-red-button',\n    },\n  }}\n/>\nUse Tailwind\n\nTo use Tailwind CSS v4, you must set the cssLayerName property to ensure that Tailwind's utility styles are applied after Clerk's styles.\n\nIt's recommended to add this to the \n<ClerkProvider>\n that wraps your app so that it's applied to all Clerk components, as shown in the following example. The example names the layer clerk but you can name it anything you want.\n\nUse the following tabs to view the code necessary for each file.\n\nlayout.tsx\nglobal.css\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    cssLayerName: 'clerk',\n  }}\n>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\n\nThen, you can use Tailwind's classes to style the elements of the Clerk component. The following example shows how to use Tailwind classes to style the primary button in a <SignIn /> component:\n\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      formButtonPrimary: 'bg-slate-500 hover:bg-slate-400 text-sm',\n    },\n  }}\n/>\nUse CSS modules to style Clerk components\n\nCSS modules are a great way to scope your CSS to a specific component.\n\nCreate your module file and add the CSS you want to apply, as shown in the following example for the <SignIn /> component:\n\nstyles/SignIn.module.css\n.primaryColor {\n  background-color: bisque;\n  color: black;\n}\n\nThen you can apply this by importing the file and using the classes whenever required:\n\nimport styles from '../styles/SignIn.module.css'\n\nexport default function CustomSignIn() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn\n      appearance={{\n        elements: {\n          formButtonPrimary: styles.primaryColor,\n        },\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\nUse inline CSS objects\n\nYou can style the elements of a Clerk component with inline CSS objects.\n\nThe following example shows how to style the primary button in a <SignIn /> component with an inline CSS object:\n\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      formButtonPrimary: {\n        fontSize: 14,\n        textTransform: 'none',\n        backgroundColor: '#611BBD',\n        '&:hover, &:focus, &:active': {\n          backgroundColor: '#49247A',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  }}\n/>\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

They require more development effort and are not as easy to maintain as the prebuilt components. However, if \nprebuilt components\n don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API.\n\nIf you choose this approach, the Clerk support team will do their best to assist you, but they cannot guarantee a resolution due to the highly customized nature of custom flows.\n\nThe custom flow guide that you need will depend on the settings you've configured in the Clerk Dashboard. For example, if you've enabled email and password, then you'd choose the custom flow for email and password. It's likely you'll need to combine many of the guides to build out your application.\n\nTo get started, choose the guide that best fits your needs from the navigation on the left.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to build a custom user interface that allows users to sign up or sign in within a single flow. It uses email and password authentication, but you can modify this approach according to the needs of your application.\n\nEnable email and password authentication\n\nTo use email and password authentication, you first need to ensure they are enabled for your application.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page.\nEnable Sign-up with email and Sign-in with email.\nSelect the Password tab and enable Sign-up with password. Leave Require a password at sign-up enabled.\n\nNote\n\nBy default, Email verification code is enabled for both sign-up and sign-in. This means that when a user signs up using their email address, Clerk sends a one-time code to their email address. The user must then enter this code to verify their email and complete the sign-up process. When the user uses the email address to sign in, they are emailed a one-time code to sign in. If you'd like to use Email verification link instead, see the custom flow for email links.\n\nSign-in-or-up flow\n\nBecause this guide uses email and password authentication, the example uses the code examples from the email/password custom flow guide. If you are using a different authentication method, such as email or SMS OTP or email links, you will need to adapt the code accordingly.\n\nTo blend a sign-up and sign-in flow into a single flow, you must treat it as a sign-in flow, but with the ability to sign up a new user if they don't have an account. You can do this by checking for the form_identifier_not_found error if the sign-in process fails, and then starting the sign-up process.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/sign-in/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn, useSignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\nimport type { EmailCodeFactor } from '@clerk/types'\n\nexport default function SignInForm() {\n  const { isLoaded, signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const { signUp } = useSignUp()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('')\n  const [showEmailCode, setShowEmailCode] = React.useState(false)\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  // Handle the submission of the form\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    // Start the sign-in process using the email and password provided\n    // If the user is not signed up yet, this will catch the `form_identifier_not_found` error\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      // If sign-in process is complete, set the created session as active\n      // and redirect the user\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              // Handle pending session tasks\n              // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else if (signInAttempt.status === 'needs_second_factor') {\n        // Check if email_code is a valid second factor\n        // This is required when Client Trust is enabled and the user\n        // is signing in from a new device.\n        // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/client-trust\n        const emailCodeFactor = signInAttempt.supportedSecondFactors?.find(\n          (factor): factor is EmailCodeFactor => factor.strategy === 'email_code',\n        )\n\n        if (emailCodeFactor) {\n          await signIn.prepareSecondFactor({\n            strategy: 'email_code',\n            emailAddressId: emailCodeFactor.emailAddressId,\n          })\n\n          // Display second form to capture the verification code\n          setShowEmailCode(true)\n        }\n      } else {\n        // If the status is not complete, check why.

These errors contain a code, message, longMessage and meta property. These properties can be used to provide your users with useful information about the errors being returned from sign-up and sign-in requests.\n\nTip\n\nTo see a list of all possible errors, refer to the Errors documentation.\n\nExample\n\nThe following example uses the email & password sign-in custom flow to demonstrate how to handle errors returned during the sign-in process.\n\nHook\nJavaScript\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { ClerkAPIError } from '@clerk/types'\nimport { isClerkAPIResponseError } from '@clerk/nextjs/errors'\n\nexport default function SignInForm() {\n  const { isLoaded, signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const [errors, setErrors] = React.useState<ClerkAPIError[]>()\n\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  // Handle the submission of the sign-in form\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    // Clear any errors that may have occurred during previous form submission\n    setErrors(undefined)\n\n    if (!isLoaded) {\n      return\n    }\n\n    // Start the sign-in process using the email and password provided\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      // If sign-in process is complete, set the created session as active\n      // and redirect the user\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              // Handle pending session tasks\n              // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else {\n        // If the status is not complete, check why.

You will be able to try again in 30 minutes. For more information, contact support.\",\n      \"code\": \"user_locked\",\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"lockout_expires_in_seconds\": 1800\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nlockout_expires_in_seconds represents the time remaining until the user is able to attempt authentication again. In the above example, 1800 seconds (or 30 minutes) are left until they are able to retry, as of the current moment.\n\nThe admin might have configured e.g. a 45-minute lockout duration. Thus, 15 minutes after one has been locked, 30 minutes will still remain until the lockout lapses.\n\nYou can opt to render the error message returned as-is or format the supplied lockout_expires_in_seconds value as per your liking in your own custom error message.\n\nFor instance, if you wish to inform a user at which absolute time they will be able to try again, you could add the remaining seconds to the current time and format the resulting timestamp.\n\nif (errors[0].code === 'user_locked') {\n  // Get the current date and time\n  let currentDate = new Date()\n\n  // Add the remaining seconds until lockout expires\n  currentDate.setSeconds(currentDate.getSeconds() + errors[0].meta.lockout_expires_in_seconds)\n\n  // Format the resulting date and time into a human-readable string\n  const lockoutExpiresAt = currentDate.toLocaleString()\n\n  // Do something with lockoutExpiresAt\n  console.log('Your account is locked, you will be able to try again at ' + lockoutExpiresAt)\n}\nPassword compromised\n\nIf you have enabled the Reject compromised passwords setting, then sign-up/sign-in and password update attempts will be rejected with an error if the password is compromised. In this case, you can prompt the user to reset their password. See the dedicated custom flow guide for more information.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nThis guide will walk you through how to build a custom email and password sign-up and sign-in flow.\n\nEnable email and password authentication\n\nTo use email and password authentication, you first need to ensure they are enabled for your application.\n\nEnable Sign-up with email.\nFor Verify at sign-up, Email verification code is enabled by default, and is used for this guide. If you'd like to use Email verification link instead, see the email links custom flow.\nEnable Sign in with email.\nThis guide supports password authentication. If you'd like to build a custom flow that allows users to sign in passwordlessly, see the email code custom flow or the email links custom flow.\nSelect the Password tab and enable Sign-up with password.\nSign-up flow\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\nInitiate the sign-up process by passing the user's email address and password to the SignUp.create() method.\nTo verify the user's email address, send a one-time code to the provided email address with the SignUp.prepareEmailAddressVerification() method.\nCollect the user's one-time code and verify it with the SignUp.attemptEmailAddressVerification() method.\nIf the email address verification is successful, the SignUp.status will be complete, and you can finish the sign-up flow by calling the setActive() method, which will set the newly created session as the active session.

This example handles the email_code second factor, so send a one-time code to the provided email address with the SignIn.prepareSecondFactor() method.\nCollect the user's one-time code and verify it with the SignIn.attemptSecondFactor() method.\nIf the second factor verification is successful, the SignIn.status will be complete, and you can finish the sign-in flow by calling the setActive() method, which will set the newly created session as the active session. You may need to check for session tasks⁠ that are required for the user to complete after signing in.\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\nimport type { EmailCodeFactor } from '@clerk/types'\n\nexport default function SignInForm() {\n  const { isLoaded, signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('')\n  const [showEmailCode, setShowEmailCode] = React.useState(false)\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  // Handle the submission of the sign-in form\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    // Start the sign-in process using the email and password provided\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      // If sign-in process is complete, set the created session as active\n      // and redirect the user\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              // Handle pending session tasks\n              // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else if (signInAttempt.status === 'needs_second_factor') {\n        // Check if email_code is a valid second factor\n        // This is required when Client Trust is enabled and the user\n        // is signing in from a new device.\n        // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/client-trust\n        const emailCodeFactor = signInAttempt.supportedSecondFactors?.find(\n          (factor): factor is EmailCodeFactor => factor.strategy === 'email_code',\n        )\n\n        if (emailCodeFactor) {\n          await signIn.prepareSecondFactor({\n            strategy: 'email_code',\n            emailAddressId: emailCodeFactor.emailAddressId,\n          })\n          setShowEmailCode(true)\n        }\n      } else {\n        // If the status is not complete, check why.

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nClerk supports passwordless authentication, which lets users sign in and sign up without having to remember a password. Instead, users receive a one-time password (OTP⁠) via email or phone, which they can use to authenticate themselves.\n\nThis guide will walk you through how to build a custom phone OTP sign-up and sign-in flow. The process for using email OTP is similar, and the differences will be highlighted throughout.\n\nWarning\n\nPhone numbers must be in E.164 format⁠.\n\nEnable phone OTP\n\nTo use phone OTP⁠, you first need to enable it for your application.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page.\nSelect the Phone tab and enable Sign-up with phone and Sign-in with phone. It's recommended to enable Verify at sign-up.\nSign-up flow\n\nTo sign up a user using an OTP⁠, you must:\n\nInitiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's identifier, which for this example is a phone number.\nSend the user an OTP⁠ to the given identifier.\nVerify the code supplied by the user.\nIf the SignUp.status is 'complete', set the newly created session as the active session. You may need to check for session tasks⁠ that are required for the user to complete after signing up.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\nTo create a sign-up flow for email OTP⁠, the flow is the same except you'll swap phoneNumber for emailAddress throughout the code.

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nEmail links can be used to sign up new users, sign in existing users, or allow existing users to verify newly added email addresses to their user profiles.\n\nThe email link flow works as follows:\n\nThe user enters their email address and asks for an email link.\nClerk sends an email to the user, containing a link to the verification URL.\nThe user visits the email link, either on the same device where they entered their email address or on a different device, depending on the settings in the Clerk Dashboard.\nClerk verifies the user's identity and advances any sign-up or sign-in attempt that might be in progress.\nIf the verification is successful, the user is authenticated or their email address is verified, depending on the reason for the email link.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use Clerk's API to build a custom flow for handling email links. It covers the following scenarios:\n\nSign up\nSign in\nVerify a new email address\nEnable email link authentication\n\nTo allow your users to sign up or sign in using email links, you must first configure the appropriate settings in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page.\nEnable Verify at sign-up, and under Verification methods, enable Email verification link.\nEnable Sign-in with email. Because this guide focuses on email links, disable Email verification code and enable Email verification link. By default, Require the same device and browser is enabled, which means that email links are required to be verified from the same device and browser on which the sign-up or sign-in was initiated. For this guide, leave this setting enabled.\nSign-up flow\nThe \nuseSignUp()\n hook is used to get the SignUp object.\nThe SignUp object is used to access the createEmailLinkFlow() method.\nThe createEmailLinkFlow() method is used to access the startEmailLinkFlow() method.\nThe startEmailLinkFlow() method is called with the redirectUrl parameter set to /sign-up/verify.

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nSession tasks are pending requirements that users must complete after authentication, such as choosing an Organization. These tasks ensure that users meet all requirements before gaining full access to your application.\n\nWhen enabled in the Clerk Dashboard, these tasks are handled automatically within the <SignIn /> and <SignUp /> components. If the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can opt out of using the <SignUp /> and <SignIn /> components and create a custom flow⁠ to display tasks.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use the Clerk API to build a custom user interface for handling session tasks.\n\nAvailable tasks\n\nEach task is identified by a unique SessionTask['key']. You can use these task keys to conditionally handle different requirements in your application logic.\n\nThe following table lists the available tasks and their corresponding keys.\n\nSetting\tKey\tDescription\nAllow Personal Accounts\tchoose-organization\tDisabled by default when enabling Organizations for instances created after August 22, 2025⁠. When disabled, users are required to choose an Organization after authenticating. When enabled, users can choose a Personal Account⁠ instead of an Organization.\nForce password reset\treset-password\tEnabled by default for instances created after December 8, 2025⁠. When enabled, the user is required to reset their password on their next sign-in if their password is marked as compromised.\nDetect pending session tasks\n\nFirst, you need to tell your app where to redirect users when they have pending session tasks.\n\nThe taskUrls option allows you to specify custom URL paths where users are redirected after sign-up or sign-in when specific session tasks need to be completed.\n\nConfigure the taskUrls option on the \n<ClerkProvider>\n component.\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  taskUrls={{\n    'choose-organization': '/session-tasks/choose-organization',\n    'reset-password': '/session-tasks/reset-password',\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\nDisplay tasks\n\nNow, the user will be redirected to the URL you've set with the taskUrls option. You need to display the appropriate task UI based on the task that the user needs to complete. If you were using the prebuilt components, you would simply render the appropriate component based on the task. However, since you're building a custom flow, you need to build the UI yourself. You can use the custom flow guide associated with the task to help get you started:\n\nSession task\tCustom flow guide\nchoose-organization\tOrganization switcher guide\nreset-password\tReset password guide\nProtect routes\n\nWhat if your user exits the authentication or session task flow before completing their tasks and doesn't know how to get to the appropriate page to complete their session tasks? What if your user is navigating through your app as a pending user and can't figure out why they can't access certain content?\n\nIf a user's authentication or session task flow is interrupted and they aren't able to complete the tasks, you can use the \n<RedirectToTasks />\n component to redirect them to the appropriate task page so they can complete the tasks and move their session to an active (signed-in) state. This component will redirect users based on the URL's you've set with the taskUrls option.\n\nIn the following example, the <RedirectToTasks /> component is used to protect a page. Users can't access this page until they complete their pending session tasks. You can also wrap your entire application in the <RedirectToTasks /> component, or place it in your application's layout file, so that users can't access any of your app until they complete their pending session tasks.\n\napp/routes/index.tsx\nimport { RedirectToTasks } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: Home,\n})\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return <RedirectToTasks />\n}\nFAQ\nWhat is the navigate parameter in setActive() doing?\n\nIn the authentication custom flows, such as the email/password custom flow, there's a step where you set the session to active using setActive(). If there are pending session tasks, the session won't actually be set as active. It will be in a pending state until all tasks are completed. By default, pending sessions are treated as signed-out across Clerk's authentication context, so the pending user won't be able to access protected content or routes. Therefore, this is the step where you should check for pending session tasks and redirect to the appropriate task page.\n\nawait setActive({\n  session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n  navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n    // Handle pending session tasks\n    // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks\n    if (session?.currentTask) {\n      console.log(session?.currentTask)\n      router.push(`/session-tasks/${session?.currentTask.key}`)\n      return\n    }\n\n    router.push('/')\n  },\n})\n\nHowever, if you've set the taskUrls option on your Clerk integration, it will override the navigate behavior and will redirect the user to whatever URL path you've set for the task. It's recommended to rely on the taskUrls option so that you can maintain the task URLs in one place (your Clerk integration). However, the navigate parameter is still useful and can be used as a fallback.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nMulti-factor verification (MFA) is an added layer of security that requires users to provide a second verification factor to access an account.\n\nClerk supports second factor verification⁠ through SMS verification code, Authenticator application, and Backup codes.\n\nThis guide will walk you through how to build a custom email/password sign-in flow that supports Authenticator application and Backup codes as the second factor.\n\nEnable email and password\n\nThis guide uses email and password to sign in, however, you can modify this approach according to the needs of your application.\n\nTo follow this guide, you first need to ensure email and password are enabled for your application.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page.\nEnable Sign-in with email.\nSelect the Password tab and enable Sign-up with password. Leave Require a password at sign-up enabled.\nEnable multi-factor authentication\n\nFor your users to be able to enable MFA for their account, you need to enable MFA for your application.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Multi-factor⁠ page.\nFor the purpose of this guide, toggle on both the Authenticator application and Backup codes strategies.\nSelect Save.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you're using Duo as an authenticator app, please note that Duo generates TOTP codes differently than other authenticator apps. Duo allows a code to be valid for 30 seconds from the moment it is first displayed, which may cause frequent invalid_code errors if the code is not entered promptly. More information can be found in Duo's Help Center⁠.\n\nSign-in flow\n\nSigning in to an MFA-enabled account is identical to the regular sign-in process. However, in the case of an MFA-enabled account, a sign-in won't convert until both first factors⁠ and second factors⁠ verifications are completed.\n\nTip\n\nFor this example to work, the user must have MFA enabled on their account.

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nClerk supports passwordless authentication via passkeys, enabling users to sign in without having to remember a password. Instead, users select a passkey associated with their device, which they can use to authenticate themselves.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use the Clerk API to build a custom user interface for creating, signing users in with, and managing passkeys.\n\nEnable passkeys\n\nTo use passkeys, first enable the strategy in the Clerk Dashboard⁠.\n\nNote\n\nWhen setting up passkeys with Android or Expo, there are a few additional steps to follow:\n\nSet up passkeys for Android\n.\nSet up passkeys for Expo\n.\nDomain restrictions for passkeys\n\nPasskeys are tied to the domain they are created on and cannot be used across different domains. However, passkeys do work on subdomains if they are registered on the root domain. For example:\n\nPasskeys created on your-domain.com cannot be used on your-domain-admin.com (different domains).\nPasskeys created on your-domain.com can be used on accounts.your-domain.com (subdomain of the same root domain).\nPasskeys created on staging1.your-domain.com cannot be used on staging2.your-domain.com (sibling subdomains) unless the passkey was scoped to your-domain.com (i.e. the shared root domain).\n\nIf you're using satellite domains, in both development and production, passkeys won't be portable between your primary domain and your satellite domains so you should avoid using them.\n\nIf you're not using satellite domains:\n\nIn development, you can either:\n\nThe recommended approach. Use Clerk's \ncomponents\n, Elements, or custom flows⁠, instead of the Account Portal. This ensures the passkey is created and used entirely on your development domain, so passkeys created on localhost will only work on localhost.\nCreate a passkey directly through the Account Portal instead of your local application to keep it tied to the Account Portal's domain. Passkeys created on your Account Portal (e.g., your-app.accounts.dev) will only work on that domain, which can cause issues if you switch between localhost and the Account Portal during development. If you choose this approach, ensure all testing happens on the same domain where the passkey was created.\n\nIn production, your Account Portal is usually hosted on a subdomain of your main domain (e.g. accounts.your-domain.com), enabling passkeys to work seamlessly across your app. However, as stated above, if you use satellite domains, passkeys will not work as intended.\n\nCreate user passkeys\n\nTo create a passkey for a user, you must call User.createPasskey(), as shown in the following example:\n\ncomponents/CustomCreatePasskeysButton.tsx\nexport function CreatePasskeyButton() {\n  const { isSignedIn, user } = useUser()\n\n  const createClerkPasskey = async () => {\n    if (!isSignedIn) {\n      // Handle signed out state\n      return\n    }\n\n    try {\n      await user?.createPasskey()\n    } catch (err) {\n      // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/error-handling\n      // for more info on error handling\n      console.error('Error:', JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  return <button onClick={createClerkPasskey}>Create a passkey</button>\n}\nSign a user in with a passkey\n\nTo sign a user into your Clerk app with a passkey, you must call SignIn.authenticateWithPasskey(). This method allows users to choose from their discoverable passkeys, such as hardware keys or passkeys in password managers.\n\ncomponents/SignInWithPasskeyButton.tsx\nexport function SignInWithPasskeyButton() {\n  const { signIn } = useSignIn()\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  const signInWithPasskey = async () => {\n    // 'discoverable' lets the user choose a passkey\n    // without auto-filling any of the options\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn?.authenticateWithPasskey({\n        flow: 'discoverable',\n      })\n\n      if (signInAttempt?.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          redirectUrl: '/',\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              // Handle pending session tasks\n              // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else {\n        // If the status is not complete, check why. User may need to\n        // complete further steps.\n        console.error(JSON.stringify(signInAttempt, null, 2))\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/error-handling\n      // for more info on error handling\n      console.error('Error:', JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  return <button onClick={signInWithPasskey}>Sign in with a passkey</button>\n}\nRename user passkeys\n\nClerk generates a name based on the device associated with the passkey when it's created. Sometimes users may want to rename a passkey to make it easier to identify.\n\ncomponents/RenamePasskeyUI.tsx\nexport function RenamePasskeyUI() {\n  const { user } = useUser()\n  const { passkeys } = user\n\n  const passkeyToUpdateId = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)\n  const newPasskeyName = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)\n  const [success, setSuccess] = useState(false)\n\n  const renamePasskey = async () => {\n    try {\n      const passkeyToUpdate = passkeys?.find(\n        (pk: PasskeyResource) => pk.id === passkeyToUpdateId.current?.value,\n      )\n\n      await passkeyToUpdate?.update({\n        name: newPasskeyName.current?.value,\n      })\n\n      setSuccess(true)\n    } catch (err) {\n      // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/error-handling\n      // for more info on error handling\n      console.error('Error:', JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n      setSuccess(false)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>Passkeys:</p>\n      <ul>\n        {passkeys?.map((pk: PasskeyResource) => {\n          return (\n            <li key={pk.id}>\n              Name: {pk.name} | ID: {pk.id}\n            </li>\n          )\n        })}\n      </ul>\n      <input ref={passkeyToUpdateId} type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter the passkey ID\" />\n      <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter the passkey's new name\" ref={newPasskeyName} />\n      <button onClick={renamePasskey}>Rename passkey</button>\n      <p>Passkey updated: {success ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\nDelete user passkeys\n\nTo delete a user's passkey from your Clerk app, you must call the delete() method of the passkey object, as shown in the following example:\n\ncomponents/DeletePasskeyUI.tsx\nexport function DeletePasskeyUI() {\n  const { user } = useUser()\n  const { passkeys } = user\n\n  const passkeyToDeleteId = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)\n  const [success, setSuccess] = useState(false)\n\n  const deletePasskey = async () => {\n    const passkeyToDelete = passkeys?.find((pk: any) => pk.id === passkeyToDeleteId.current?.value)\n    try {\n      await passkeyToDelete?.delete()\n\n      setSuccess(true)\n    } catch (err) {\n      // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/error-handling\n      // for more info on error handling\n      console.error('Error:', JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n      setSuccess(false)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>Passkeys:</p>\n      <ul>\n        {passkeys?.map((pk: any) => {\n          return (\n            <li key={pk.id}>\n              Name: {pk.name} | ID: {pk.id}\n            </li>\n          )\n        })}\n      </ul>\n      <input ref={passkeyToDeleteId} type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter the passkey ID\" />\n      <button onClick={deletePasskey}>Delete passkey</button>\n      <p>Passkey deleted: {success ?

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nBefore you start\n\nYou must configure your application instance through the Clerk Dashboard for the social connection(s) that you want to use. Visit the appropriate guide for your platform to learn how to configure your instance.\n\nCreate the sign-up and sign-in flow\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\nFirst, in your .env file, set the NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL environment variable to tell Clerk where the sign-in page is being hosted. Otherwise, your app may default to using the Account Portal sign-in page instead. This guide uses the /sign-in route.\n\n.env\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in\n\nThe following example will both sign up and sign in users, eliminating the need for a separate sign-up page. However, if you want to have separate sign-up and sign-in pages, the sign-up and sign-in flows are equivalent, meaning that all you have to do is swap out the SignIn object for the SignUp object using the \nuseSignUp()\n hook.\n\nThe following example:\n\nAccesses the SignIn object using the \nuseSignIn()\n hook.\nStarts the authentication process by calling SignIn.authenticateWithRedirect(params). This method requires a redirectUrl param, which is the URL that the browser will be redirected to once the user authenticates with the identity provider.\nCreates a route at the URL that the redirectUrl param points to. The following example names this route /sso-callback. This route should either render the prebuilt \n<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback/>\n component or call the Clerk.handleRedirectCallback() method if you're not using the prebuilt component.\n\nThe following example shows two files:\n\nThe sign-in page where the user can start the authentication flow.\nThe SSO callback page where the flow is completed.\nSign in page\nSSO callback page\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { OAuthStrategy } from '@clerk/types'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { signIn } = useSignIn()\n\n  if (!signIn) return null\n\n  const signInWith = (strategy: OAuthStrategy) => {\n    return signIn\n      .authenticateWithRedirect({\n        strategy,\n        redirectUrl: '/sign-in/sso-callback',\n        redirectUrlComplete: '/sign-in/tasks', // Learn more about session tasks at https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks\n      })\n      .then((res) => {\n        console.log(res)\n      })\n      .catch((err: any) => {\n        // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/error-handling\n        // for more info on error handling\n        console.log(err.errors)\n        console.error(err, null, 2)\n      })\n  }\n\n  // Render a button for each supported OAuth provider\n  // you want to add to your app. This example uses only Google.\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => signInWith('oauth_google')}>Sign in with Google</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nHandle missing requirements\n\nDepending on your instance settings, users might need to provide extra information before their sign-up can be completed, such as when a username or accepting legal terms is required. In these cases, the SignUp object returns a status of \"missing_requirements\" along with a missingFields array. You can create a \"Continue\" page to collect these missing fields and complete the sign-up flow. Handling the missing requirements will depend on your instance settings. For example, if your instance settings require a phone number, you will need to handle verifying the phone number.\n\nQuiz\n\nWhy does the \"Continue\" page use the useSignUp() hook? What if a user is using this flow to sign in?\n\nShow answer\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\nContinue page\nSSO callback page\napp/sign-in/continue/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { useSignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  // Use `useSignUp()` hook to access the `SignUp` object\n  // `missing_requirements` and `missingFields` are only available on the `SignUp` object\n  const { isLoaded, signUp, setActive } = useSignUp()\n  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<Record<string, string>>({})\n\n  if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading…</div>\n\n  // Protect the page from users who are not in the sign-up flow\n  // such as users who visited this route directly\n  if (!signUp.id) router.push('/sign-in')\n\n  const status = signUp?.status\n  const missingFields = signUp?.missingFields ??

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nClerk's \n<UserButton />\n and \n<SignOutButton />\n components provide an out-of-the-box solution for signing out users. However, if you're building a custom solution, you can use the signOut() function to handle the sign-out process.\n\nThe signOut() function signs a user out of all sessions in a multi-session application, or only the current session in a single-session context. You can also specify a specific session to sign out by passing the sessionId parameter.\n\nNote\n\nThe sign-out flow deactivates only the current session. Other valid sessions associated with the same user (e.g., if the user is signed in on another device) will remain active.\n\nThe \nuseClerk()\n hook is used to access the signOut() function, which is called when the user clicks the \"Sign out\" button.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/components/sign-out-button.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useClerk } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport const SignOutButton = () => {\n  const { signOut } = useClerk()\n\n  return (\n    // Clicking this button signs out a user\n    // and redirects them to the home page \"/\".\n    <button onClick={() => signOut({ redirectUrl: '/' })}>Sign out</button>\n  )\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nWhen a user visits an invitation link, Clerk first checks whether a custom redirect URL was provided.\n\nIf no redirect URL is specified, the user will be redirected to the appropriate Account Portal page (either sign-up or sign-in), or to the custom sign-up/sign-in pages that you've configured for your application.\n\nIf you specified a redirect URL when creating the invitation, you must handle the authentication flows in your code for that page. You can either embed the \n<SignIn />\n component on that page, or if the prebuilt component doesn't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. This guide demonstrates how to use Clerk's API to build a custom flow for accepting application invitations.\n\nBuild the custom flow\n\nOnce the user visits the invitation link and is redirected to the specified URL, the query parameter __clerk_ticket will be appended to the URL. This query parameter contains the invitation token.\n\nFor example, if the redirect URL was https://www.example.com/accept-invitation, the URL that the user would be redirected to would be https://www.example.com/accept-invitation?__clerk_ticket=......\n\nTo create a sign-up flow using the invitation token, you need to extract the token from the URL and pass it to the signUp.create() method, as shown in the following example.\n\nThe following example expects the user to be signing up with a password and also demonstrates how to collect additional user information for the sign-up, like a first and last name. You can keep, remove, or adjust these fields to fit your application, but either way, you will need to have these settings properly configured in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/accept-invitation/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignUp, useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useSearchParams, useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { isSignedIn, user } = useUser()\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const { isLoaded, signUp, setActive } = useSignUp()\n\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  // Optionally, collect additional fields that your app requires\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = React.useState('')\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = React.useState('')\n\n  // Handle signed-in users visiting this page\n  // This will also redirect the user once they finish the sign-up process\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    if (isSignedIn) {\n      router.push('/')\n    }\n  }, [isSignedIn])\n\n  // Get the token from the query params\n  const token = useSearchParams().get('__clerk_ticket')\n\n  // If there is no invitation token, restrict access to this page\n  if (!token) {\n    return <p>No invitation token found.</p>\n  }\n\n  // Handle submission of the sign-up form\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      if (!token) return null\n\n      // Create a new sign-up with the supplied invitation token.\n      // Make sure you're also passing the ticket strategy.\n      // After the below call, the user's email address will be\n      // automatically verified because of the invitation token.\n      const signUpAttempt = await signUp.create({\n        strategy: 'ticket',\n        ticket: token,\n        firstName,\n        lastName,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      // If the sign-up was completed, set the session to active\n      if (signUpAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({ session: signUpAttempt.createdSessionId })\n      } else {\n        // If the sign-up status is not complete, check why.

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nA multi-session application is an application that allows multiple accounts to be signed in from the same browser at the same time. The user can switch from one account to another seamlessly. Each account is independent from the rest and has access to different resources.\n\nThis guide provides you with the necessary information to build a custom multi-session flow using the Clerk API.\n\nTo implement the multi-session feature to your application, you need to handle the following scenarios:\n\nSwitching between different accounts\nAdding new accounts\nSigning out from one account, while remaining signed in to the rest\nSigning out from all accounts\nEnable multi-session in your application\n\nTo enable multi-session in your application, you need to configure it in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\nToggle on Multi-session handling.\nSelect Save changes.\nGet the session and user\n// Get the session and user\nconst { session, user } = useClerk()\nSwitch between sessions\nconst { client, setActive } = useClerk()\n\n// You can get all the available sessions through the client\nconst availableSessions = client.sessions\nconst currentSession = availableSessions[0].id\n\n// Use setActive() to set the session as active\nawait setActive({\n  session: currentSession.id,\n  navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n    if (session?.currentTask) {\n      // Handle pending session tasks\n      // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks\n      console.log(session?.currentTask)\n      return\n    }\n\n    router.push('/')\n  },\n})\nAdd a new session\n\nTo add a new session, simply link to your existing sign-in flow. New sign-ins will automatically add to the list of available sessions on the client. To create a sign-in flow, see one of the following popular guides:\n\nEmail and password\nPasswordless authentication\nSocial sign-in (OAuth)\nSign out all sessions\n\nUse signOut() to deactivate all sessions on the current client.\n\nconst { signOut, session } = useClerk()\n\n// Use signOut to sign-out all active sessions\nawait signOut()\nSign out active session\n\nUse signOut() to deactivate a specific session by passing the session ID.\n\n// Get the signOut method and the active session\nconst { signOut, session } = useClerk()\n\n// Use signOut to sign-out the active session\nawait signOut(session.id)\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

You can create email links with Clerk by generating a sign-in token.\n\nCommon use cases include:\n\nWelcome emails when users are added off a waitlist\nPromotional emails for users\nRecovering abandoned carts\nSurveys or questionnaires\n\nThis guide will demonstrate how to generate a sign-in token and use it to sign in a user.\n\nGenerate a sign-in token\n\nSign-in tokens⁠ are JWTs that can be used to sign in to an application without specifying any credentials. A sign-in token can be used once, and can be consumed from the Frontend API using the ticket strategy, which is demonstrated in the following example.\n\nNote\n\nBy default, sign-in tokens expire in 30 days. You can optionally specify a different duration in seconds using the expires_in_seconds property.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a cURL request that creates a valid sign-in token:\n\ncurl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/sign_in_tokens' \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{ \"user_id\": \"user_123\" }'\n\nThis will return a url property, which can be used as your email link. Keep in mind that this link will use the Account Portal sign-in page to sign in the user.\n\nIf you would rather use your own sign-in page, you can use the token property that is returned. Add the token as a query param in any link, such as the following example:\n\nhttps://your-site.com/accept-token?token=<INSERT_TOKEN_HERE>\n\nThen, you can embed this link anywhere, such as an email.\n\nBuild a custom flow for signing in with a sign-in token\n\nTo handle email links with sign-in tokens, you must set up a page in your frontend that detects the token, signs the user in, and performs any additional actions you need.\n\nThe following example demonstrates basic code that detects a token in the URL query params and uses it to initiate a sign-in with Clerk.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/accept-token/page.tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useUser, useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react'\nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)\n  const { signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const { isSignedIn, user } = useUser()\n\n  // Get the token from the query params\n  const signInToken = useSearchParams().get('token')\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!signIn || !setActive || !signInToken || user || loading) {\n      return\n    }\n\n    const createSignIn = async () => {\n      setLoading(true)\n      try {\n        // Create the `SignIn` with the token\n        const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n          strategy: 'ticket',\n          ticket: signInToken as string,\n        })\n\n        // If the sign-in was successful, set the session to active\n        if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n          setActive({\n            session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          })\n        } else {\n          // If the sign-in attempt is not complete, check why.\n          // User may need to complete further steps.\n          console.error(JSON.stringify(signInAttempt, null, 2))\n        }\n      } catch (err) {\n        // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/error-handling\n        // for more info on error handling\n        console.error('Error:', JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n      } finally {\n        setLoading(false)\n      }\n    }\n\n    createSignIn()\n  }, [signIn, setActive, signInToken, user, loading])\n\n  if (!signInToken) {\n    return <div>No token provided.</div>\n  }\n\n  if (!isSignedIn) {\n    // Handle signed out state\n    return null\n  }\n\n  if (loading) {\n    return <div>Signing you in...</div>\n  }\n\n  return <div>Signed in as {user.id}</div>\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nClerk provides the ability to add a CAPTCHA widget to your sign-up flows to protect against bot sign-ups. The \n<SignUp />\n component handles this flow out-of-the-box. However, if you're building a custom user interface, this guide will show you how to add the CAPTCHA widget to your custom sign-up flow.\n\nEnable bot sign-up protection\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Attack protection⁠ page.\nEnable the Bot sign-up protection toggle.\n\nWarning\n\nIf your application previously had the Invisible CAPTCHA type selected, it's highly recommended to switch to the Smart option, as the Invisible option is deprecated. For newer applications, CAPTCHA type options are no longer shown in the Dashboard. Bot protection uses the Smart option by default and is enabled by turning on the Bot sign-up protection toggle only.\n\nAdd the CAPTCHA widget to your custom sign-up form\n\nTo render the CAPTCHA widget in your custom sign-up form, you need to include the <div id=\"clerk-captcha\" /> element by the time you call signUp.create(). This element acts as a placeholder onto which the widget will be rendered.\n\nIf this element is not found, the SDK will transparently fall back to an invisible widget in order to avoid breaking your sign-up flow. If this happens, you should see a relevant error in your browser's console.\n\nTip\n\nThe invisible widget fallback automatically blocks suspected bot traffic without offering users falsely detected as bots with an opportunity to prove otherwise. Therefore, it's strongly recommended that you ensure the <div id=\"clerk-captcha\" /> element exists in your DOM.\n\nThe following example shows how to support the CAPTCHA widget:\n\n<>\n  <h1>Sign up</h1>\n  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n    <div>\n      <label htmlFor=\"email\">Enter email address</label>\n      <input\n        id=\"email\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        name=\"email\"\n        value={emailAddress}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmailAddress(e.target.value)}\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <label htmlFor=\"password\">Enter password</label>\n      <input\n        id=\"password\"\n        type=\"password\"\n        name=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n      />\n    </div>\n\n    {/* Clerk's CAPTCHA widget */}\n    <div id=\"clerk-captcha\" />\n\n    <button type=\"submit\">Continue</button>\n  </form>\n</>\nCustomize the appearance of the CAPTCHA widget\n\nYou can customize the appearance of the CAPTCHA widget by passing data attributes to the <div id=\"clerk-captcha\" /> element. The following attributes are supported:\n\ndata-cl-theme: The CAPTCHA widget theme. Can take the following values: 'light', 'dark', 'auto'. Defaults to 'auto'.\ndata-cl-size: The CAPTCHA widget size. Can take the following values: 'normal', 'flexible', 'compact'. Defaults to 'normal'.\ndata-cl-language: The CAPTCHA widget language. Must be either 'auto' (default) to use the language that the visitor has chosen, or language and country code (e.g. 'en-US'). Some languages are supported by Clerk but not by Cloudflare Turnstile, which is used for the CAPTCHA widget. See Cloudflare Turnstile's supported languages⁠.\n\nFor example, to set the theme to 'dark', the size to 'flexible', and the language to 'es-ES', you would add the following attributes to the <div id=\"clerk-captcha\" /> element:\n\n<div id=\"clerk-captcha\" data-cl-theme=\"dark\" data-cl-size=\"flexible\" data-cl-language=\"es-ES\" />\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nWhen a user visits an Organization invitation link, Clerk first checks whether a custom redirect URL was provided.\n\nIf no redirect URL is specified, the user will be redirected to the appropriate Account Portal page (either sign-up or sign-in), or to the custom sign-up/sign-in pages that you've configured for your application.\n\nIf you specified a redirect URL when creating the invitation, you must handle the authentication flows in your code for that page. You can either embed the \n<SignIn />\n component on that page, or if the prebuilt component doesn't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use Clerk's API to build a custom flow for accepting Organization invitations from a link.\n\nBuild the custom flow\n\nOnce the user visits the invitation link and is redirected to the specified URL, the query parameters __clerk_ticket and __clerk_status will be appended to the URL.\n\nFor example, if the redirect URL was https://www.example.com/accept-invitation, the URL that the user would be redirected to would be https://www.example.com/accept-invitation?__clerk_ticket=......\n\nThe __clerk_ticket query parameter contains the ticket token, which is essential for completing the Organization invitation flow. You'll use this token in your code for the page that you redirected the user to.\n\nThe __clerk_status query parameter is the outcome of the ticket verification and will contain one of three values:\n\nsign_in indicates the user already exists in your application. You should create a sign-in flow using the invitation token by extracting the token from the URL and passing it to the signIn.create() method.\nsign_up indicates the user doesn't already exist in your application. You should create a sign-up flow using the invitation token by extracting the token from the URL and passing it to the signUp.create() method.\ncomplete indicates the user already exists in your application, and was signed in. The flow has been completed and no further actions are required.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to handle both sign-up and sign-in flows using the invitation token:\n\nIt extracts the token from the URL.\nIt passes the token to either signUp.create() or signIn.create(), depending on the __clerk_status.\nIt demonstrates how to collect additional fields during sign-up, such as first and last names. You can modify or remove these fields as needed for your application. If you do not have First and last name enabled for your instance in the Clerk Dashboard⁠, remove these fields or signUp.create() will throw an error.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/accept-invitation/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport {

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nOrganization members with appropriate Permissions can invite new users to their Organization and manage those invitations. The invitation recipient can be either an existing user of your application or a new user. If they are a new user, they will need to sign up in order to accept the invitation.\n\nUsers with the appropriate Permissions can also revoke Organization invitations for users that have not yet joined, which will prevent the user from becoming an Organization member.\n\nThis guide will demonstrate how to use the Clerk API to build a custom flow for inviting users to an Organization and managing an Organization's pending invitations.\n\nNote\n\nThis guide is for creating and managing Organization invitations client-side. You can also create an Organization invitation using the Backend API. See the Organization invitations reference for more information.\n\nAlso, see the custom flow for accepting Organization invitations.\n\nTo invite a user:\n\nUse the \nuseOrganization()\n hook to get organization, which is the Active Organization's⁠.\nUse organization to call the inviteMember() method, with the recipient's email address and desired Role passed as arguments.\n\nTo revoke an invitation:\n\nUse the useOrganization() hook to get invitations, which is a list of invitations for the Active Organization's⁠.\ninvitations is an array of OrganizationInvitation objects. Each OrganizationInvitation object has a revoke() method that can be called to revoke the invitation.\n\nThe following example includes:\n\nAn <InviteMember /> component that allows administrators to invite new members to their Organization.\nAn <InvitationList /> component that lists all pending invitations and allows administrators to revoke them.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/components/InvitationList.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useOrganization } from

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nThis guide will demonstrate how to use the Clerk API to build a custom flow for switching between Organizations.\n\nTwo examples are provided: one for a paginated list and one for an infinite list.\n\nThe following examples:\n\nUse the \nuseOrganizationList()\n hook to get memberships, which is a list of the current user's Organization memberships. memberships returns data, which is an array of OrganizationMembership objects.\nMap over the data array to display the user's Organization memberships in a table, providing a button that calls setActive() to set the selected Organization as the Active Organization⁠.\nIf there are no Organizations, the <CreateOrganization /> component (custom-flow version, not the Clerk component) is rendered to allow the user to create an Organization.\n\nThe difference between the two examples is the parameters passed to the useOrganizationList() hook in order to determine how the list is paginated.\n\nThe \"Paginated list\" example provides a button to load more Organizations if there are more available. The data array is paginated and will only return the first 5 results, so the fetchNext() method is used to load more Organizations if they are available.\nThe \"Infinite list\" example sets the infinite option to true to enable infinite results.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\nPaginated list\nInfinite list\napp/components/CustomOrganizationSwitcher.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useAuth, useOrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport CreateOrganization from '../components/create-organization' // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/organizations/create-organizations for this component\n\n// List user's organization memberships\nexport default function JoinedOrganizations() {\n  const { isLoaded, setActive, userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({\n    userMemberships: {\n      // Set pagination parameters\n      pageSize: 5,\n      keepPreviousData: true,\n    },\n  })\n  const { orgId } = useAuth()\n\n  if (!isLoaded) {\n    return <p>Loading...</p>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Joined organizations</h1>\n      {userMemberships?.data?.length > 0 && (\n        <>\n          <table>\n            <thead>\n              <tr>\n                <th>Identifier</th>\n                <th>Organization</th>\n                <th>Joined</th>\n                <th>Role</th>\n                <th>Set as active org</th>\n              </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n              {userMemberships?.data?.map((mem) => (\n                <tr key={mem.id}>\n                  <td>{mem.publicUserData.identifier}</td>\n                  <td>{mem.organization.name}</td>\n                  <td>{mem.createdAt.toLocaleDateString()}</td>\n                  <td>{mem.role}</td>\n                  <td>\n                    {orgId === mem.organization.id ?

For example, you can add text to the form with the error's message so that the user can try again.\n\nUser's password has been marked as compromised\n\nWarning\n\nIf your instance is older than December 18, 2025, you will need to update your instance⁠ to the Reset password session task update.\n\nIf you have manually marked a user's password as compromised, and the user tries authenticating with it, the sign-up/sign-in attempt will receive an HTTP status of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and the form_password_compromised error code.\n\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"long_message\": \"Your password may be compromised.

You will be required to reset your password after signing in.\",\n      \"code\": \"form_password_compromised\",\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"name\": \"param\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe user will not be able to authenticate with their compromised password, so you should:\n\nUpdate your sign-up or sign-in flow to prompt them to authenticate with another method, such as an email address (so they can use email OTP⁠ or email link), or a phone number (so they can use an SMS OTP⁠). Once they authenticate with another method, their session will enter a pending state⁠ until they reset their password. If they do not have any other identification methods, e.g if they only have username and password, they will be authenticated but their session will enter a pending state⁠ until they reset their password.\nHandle the reset-password session task so the user can reset their password and their session can be updated from pending to active.\nUpdate your sign-up/sign-in flow\n\nTo update your sign-up/sign-in flow, you can check for the error code and then prompt the user to authenticate with another method. This example uses the email/password custom flow but adds code that prompts the user to authenticate with an email code when their password is compromised. You can use the same approach with other custom flows.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/sign-in/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { ClerkAPIError, EmailCodeFactor, SignInFirstFactor } from '@clerk/types'\nimport { isClerkAPIResponseError } from '@clerk/nextjs/errors'\n\nconst SignInWithEmailCode = () => {\n  const { isLoaded, signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  const [verifying, setVerifying] = React.useState(false)\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('')\n\n  async function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent) {\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    if (!isLoaded && !signIn) return null\n\n    try {\n      // Start the sign-in process using the email code method\n      const { supportedFirstFactors } = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n      })\n\n      // Filter the returned array to find the 'email_code' entry\n      const isEmailCodeFactor = (factor: SignInFirstFactor): factor is EmailCodeFactor => {\n        return factor.strategy === 'email_code'\n      }\n      const emailCodeFactor = supportedFirstFactors?.find(isEmailCodeFactor)\n\n      if (emailCodeFactor) {\n        // Grab the emailAddressId\n        const { emailAddressId } = emailCodeFactor\n\n        // Send the OTP code to the user\n        await signIn.prepareFirstFactor({\n          strategy: 'email_code',\n          emailAddressId,\n        })\n\n        // Set verifying to true to display second form\n        // and capture the OTP code\n        setVerifying(true)\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/error-handling\n      // for more info on error handling\n      console.error('Error:', JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  async function handleVerification(e: React.FormEvent) {\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    if (!isLoaded && !signIn) return null\n\n    try {\n      // Use the code provided by the user and attempt verification\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.attemptFirstFactor({\n        strategy: 'email_code',\n        code,\n      })\n\n      // If verification was completed, set the session to active\n      // and redirect the user\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              // Handle pending session tasks\n              // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else {\n        // If the status is not complete, check why.

The reset-password session task will cause the user's session to be in a pending state until they reset their password.\n\nFirst, you need to tell your app where to redirect users when they have pending session tasks. The taskUrls option allows you to specify custom URL paths where users are redirected after sign-up or sign-in when specific session tasks need to be completed.\n\nConfigure the taskUrls option on the \n<ClerkProvider>\n component.\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  taskUrls={{\n    'choose-organization': '/session-tasks/choose-organization',\n    'reset-password': '/session-tasks/reset-password',\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\n\nNow, the user will be redirected to the URL you've set with the taskUrls option. This page is where you will add the forgot/reset password code, such as the reset user's password with an email address example from the previous section.\n\nWhat if your user exits the authentication or session task flow before completing their tasks and doesn't know how to get to the appropriate page to complete their session tasks? What if your user is navigating through your app as a pending user and can't figure out why they can't access certain content? If a user's authentication or session task flow is interrupted and they aren't able to complete the tasks, you can use the \n<RedirectToTasks />\n component to redirect them to the appropriate task page so they can complete the tasks and move their session to an active (signed-in) state. This component will redirect users based on the URL's you've set with the taskUrls option.\n\nIn the following example, the <RedirectToTasks /> component is used to protect a page. Users can't access this page until they complete their pending session tasks. You can also wrap your entire application in the <RedirectToTasks /> component, or place it in your application's layout file, so that users can't access any of your app until they complete their pending session tasks.\n\napp/routes/index.tsx\nimport { RedirectToTasks } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: Home,\n})\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return <RedirectToTasks />\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nImportant\n\nYou can perform up to 5 user impersonations per month for free. To increase this limit, refer to the pricing page⁠.\n\nClerk's user impersonation feature allows you to sign in to your application as one of your users, enabling you to directly reproduce and remedy any issues they're experiencing. It's a helpful feature for customer support and debugging.\n\nThis guide will walk you through how to build a custom flow that handles user impersonation. You will build a dashboard that is only accessible to users with the org:admin:impersonate permission. The user visiting the dashboard will see a list of the application's users. When they choose to impersonate a user, they will be signed in as that user and redirected to the homepage.\n\nBefore you start\n\nThis example builds a dashboard that is only accessible to users with the org:admin:impersonate permission. To use this example, you must first create the custom org:admin:impersonate permission. Or you can modify the authorization checks⁠ to fit your use case.\n\nBuild the custom flow\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\nUse the following tabs to view the code for:\n\nThe main page that gets the list of the application's users using the JS Backend SDK\nThe Client Component that has the UI for displaying the users and the ability to impersonate them\nThe Server Action that generates the actor token using the Backend API⁠\nMain page\nClient Component\nServer Action\napp/dashboard/page.tsx\nimport { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\nimport ImpersonateUsers from './_components'\n\nexport default async function AccountPage() {\n  const { has } = await auth()\n\n  // Protect the page\n  if (!has({ permission: 'org:admin:impersonate' })) {\n    return <p>You do not have permission to access this page.</p>\n  }\n\n  const client = await clerkClient()\n\n  // Fetch list of application's users using Clerk's JS Backend SDK\n  const users = await client.users.getUserList()\n\n  // This page needs to be a server component to use clerkClient.users.getUserList()\n  // You must pass the list of users to the client for the rest of the logic\n  // But you cannot pass the entire User object to the client,\n  // because its too complex.

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nUsers are able to add multiple email addresses to their account. Adding an email address requires the user to verify the email address before it can be added to the user's account.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to build a custom user interface that allows users to add and verify an email address for their account.\n\nConfigure email verification\n\nThere are two verification methods available for email addresses:\n\nEmail verification code: Users receive an email with an OTP⁠ to verify their email address.\nEmail verification link: Users receive an email with a link to verify their email address.\n\nBy default, the verification method that is enabled is email verification code. To use email code verification, skip to the Email code verification section.\n\nTo use email links, you must configure the following settings in the Clerk Dashboard:\n\nOn the User & authentication⁠ page of the Clerk Dashboard, in the Email tab, under the Sign-in with email section, enable the Email verification link option. By default, Require the same device and browser is enabled, which means that email links are required to be verified from the same device and browser on which the sign-up or sign-in was initiated. For this guide, leave this setting enabled.\nDisable Email verification code.\nSave your changes.\n\nThen skip to the Email link verification section.\n\nEmail code verification\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\nEvery user has a User object that represents their account. The User object has a emailAddresses property that contains all the email addresses associated with the user. The \nuseUser()\n hook is used to get the User object.\nThe User.createEmailAddress() method is passed to the \nuseReverification()\n hook to require the user to reverify their credentials before being able to add an email address to their account.\nIf the createEmailAddress() function is successful, a new EmailAddress object is created and stored in User.emailAddresses.\nThe prepareVerification() method is used on the newly created EmailAddress object to send a verification code to the user.\nThe attemptVerification() method is used on the same EmailAddress object with the verification code provided by the user to verify the email address.\napp/account/add-email/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useReverification, useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { EmailAddressResource } from '@clerk/types'\nimport * as React from 'react'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser()\n\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('')\n  const [isVerifying, setIsVerifying] = React.useState(false)\n  const [successful, setSuccessful] = React.useState(false)\n  const [emailObj, setEmailObj] = React.useState<EmailAddressResource | undefined>()\n  const createEmailAddress = useReverification((email: string) =>\n    user?.createEmailAddress({ email }),\n  )\n\n  // Handle loading state\n  if (!isLoaded) return <p>Loading...</p>\n\n  // Handle signed-out state\n  if (!isSignedIn) return <p>You must be signed in to access this page</p>\n\n  // Handle addition of the email address\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    try {\n      // Add an unverified email address to user\n      const res = await createEmailAddress(email)\n      // Reload user to get updated User object\n      await user.reload()\n\n      // Find the email address that was just added\n      const emailAddress = user.emailAddresses.find((a) => a.id === res?.id)\n      // Create a reference to the email address that was just added\n      setEmailObj(emailAddress)\n\n      // Send the user an email with the verification code\n      emailAddress?.prepareVerification({ strategy: 'email_code' })\n\n      // Set to true to display second form\n      // and capture the code\n      setIsVerifying(true)\n    } catch (err) {\n      // See https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/error-handling\n      // for more info on error handling\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Handle the submission of the verification form\n  const verifyCode = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    try {\n      // Verify that the code entered matches the code sent to the user\n      const emailVerifyAttempt = await emailObj?.attemptVerification({ code })\n\n      if (emailVerifyAttempt?.verification.status === 'verified') {\n        setSuccessful(true)\n      } else {\n        // If the status is not complete, check why.

To use a prebuilt UI, use the Account Portal pages or \nprebuilt components\n.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to build a custom user interface that allows users to add, delete, and reverify their SSO connections.\n\nBefore you start\n\nYou must configure your application instance through the Clerk Dashboard for the SSO connections that you want to use.\n\nFor social (OAuth) connection(s), see the appropriate guide for your platform.\nFor enterprise connection(s), see the appropriate guide for your platform.\n\nThis guide uses Discord, Google, and GitHub as examples.\n\nBuild the custom flow\nThe \nuseUser()\n hook is used to get the current user's User object. The isLoaded boolean is used to ensure that Clerk is loaded.\nThe options array is used to create a list of supported SSO connections. This example uses OAuth strategies. You can edit this array to include all of the SSO connections that you've enabled for your app in the Clerk Dashboard. You can also add custom SSO connections by using the oauth_custom_<name> strategy.\nThe addSSO() function is used to add a new external account using the strategy that is passed in.\nIt uses the user object to access the createExternalAccount() method.\nThe createExternalAccount() method is used to create a new external account using the strategy that is passed in. It's passed to the \nuseReverification()\n hook to require the user to reverify their credentials before being able to add an external account to their account.\nThe unconnectedOptions array is used to filter out any existing external accounts from the options array.\nThe normalizeProvider() function is used to strip the oauth prefix from each strategy so it can be matched with the provider field in the user's existing external accounts.\nIn the UI, the unconnectedOptions array is used to create a list of buttons for the user to add new external accounts.\nIn the UI, the User object is used to access the externalAccounts property, which is mapped through to create a list of the user's existing external accounts. If there is an error, it is displayed to the user in the 'Status' column. If the account didn't verify when the user added it, a 'Reverify' button is displayed, which will redirect the user to the provider in order to verify their account.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/account/manage-external-accounts/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useUser, useReverification } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { CreateExternalAccountParams, ExternalAccountResource, OAuthStrategy } from '@clerk/types'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\n// Capitalize the first letter of the provider name\n// E.g.

'oauth_discord' -> 'discord'\n// Used to match the strategy with the 'provider' field in externalAccounts\nconst normalizeProvider = (provider: string) => {\n  return provider.split('_')[1]\n}\n\nexport default function AddAccount() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  // Use Clerk's `useUser()` hook to get the current user's `User` object\n  const { isLoaded, user } = useUser()\n  const createExternalAccount = useReverification((params: CreateExternalAccountParams) =>\n    user?.createExternalAccount(params),\n  )\n  const accountDestroy = useReverification((account: ExternalAccountResource) => account.destroy())\n\n  // List the options the user can select when adding a new external account\n  // Edit this array to include all of your enabled SSO connections\n  const options: OAuthStrategy[] = ['oauth_discord', 'oauth_google', 'oauth_github']\n\n  // Handle adding the new external account\n  const addSSO = async (strategy: OAuthStrategy) => {\n    await createExternalAccount({\n      strategy,\n      redirectUrl: '/account/manage-external-accounts',\n    })\n      .then((res) => {\n        if (res?.verification?.externalVerificationRedirectURL) {\n          router.push(res.verification.externalVerificationRedirectURL.href)\n        }\n      })\n      .catch((err) => {\n        console.log('ERROR', err)\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        console.log('Redirected user to oauth provider')\n      })\n  }\n\n  // Show a loading message until Clerk loads\n  if (!isLoaded) return <p>Loading...</p>\n\n  // Find the external accounts from the options array that the user has not yet added to their account\n  // This prevents showing an 'add' button for existing external account types\n  const unconnectedOptions = options.filter(\n    (option) =>\n      !user?.externalAccounts.some((account) => account.provider === normalizeProvider(option)),\n  )\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div>\n        <p>Connected accounts</p>\n        {user?.externalAccounts.map((account) => {\n          return (\n            <ul key={account.id}>\n              <li>Provider: {capitalize(account.provider)}</li>\n              <li>Scopes: {account.approvedScopes}</li>\n              <li>\n                Status:{' '}\n                {/* This example uses the `longMessage` returned by the API.

This will target the existing default item and allow you to rearrange it.\n\nIn the following example, the \"Sign out\" menu item is moved to the top of the menu, a custom \"Create organization\" link is added as the second menu item, and the \"Manage account\" menu item is moved to the bottom of the menu.\n\nconst DotIcon = () => {\n  return (\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n      <path d=\"M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512z\" />\n    </svg>\n  )\n}\n\nconst CustomUserButton = () => {\n  return (\n    <header>\n      <UserButton>\n        <UserButton.MenuItems>\n          <UserButton.Action label=\"signOut\" />\n          <UserButton.Link\n            label=\"Create organization\"\n            labelIcon={<DotIcon />}\n            href=\"/create-organization\"\n          />\n          <UserButton.Action label=\"manageAccount\" />\n        </UserButton.MenuItems>\n      </UserButton>\n    </header>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default CustomUserButton\nConditionally render menu items\n\nTo conditionally render menu items based on a user's Role or Custom Permissions, you can use the \nhas()\n helper function.\n\nIn the following example, the \"Create organization\" menu item will only render if the current user has the org:app:admin permission.\n\nconst DotIcon = () => {\n  return (\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n      <path d=\"M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512z\" />\n    </svg>\n  )\n}\n\nconst CustomUserButton = () => {\n  const { has, isLoaded } = useAuth()\n\n  if (!isLoaded) {\n    return <span>Loading...</span>\n  }\n\n  const isAdmin = has({ permission: 'org:app:admin' })\n\n  return (\n    <header>\n      <UserButton>\n        {isAdmin && (\n          <UserButton.MenuItems>\n            <UserButton.Link\n              label=\"Create organization\"\n              labelIcon={<DotIcon />}\n              href=\"/create-organization\"\n            />\n          </UserButton.MenuItems>\n        )}\n      </UserButton>\n    </header>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default CustomUserButton\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To acquaint yourself with the template markup syntax, consult Imperavi's docs⁠.\n\nAs you will see, the template markup is an HTML-like language and each type of node supports its own set of attributes which control its behavior. A lot of the attributes are borrowed from HTML itself.\n\nRevolvapp allows the user to design the template using blocks and under the hood transpiles its markup to table-based HTML so that the resulting email renders consistently across email clients.\n\nHandlebars templating language\n\nBoth the email and SMS editor use the Handlebars⁠ templating language for the interpolation of dynamic values into your content via variables⁠. Variables are wrapped in double curly braces. For example: {{app.name}}. When the message is to be sent, the variable will be replaced with the actual value, which in this example would be the name of the application.\n\nWhen editing a template in the Clerk Dashboard, you can insert variables at the desired position, so there is no need to write them by hand. Though, you can still do so if you like.\n\nNote\n\nIn order to unescape special characters, you may need to wrap variables in triple curly braces. For example: {{{app.name}}}. This will allow special characters (e.g. ', &) to appear as displayed and not as escaped HTML entities (e.g. &apos;, &amp;).\n\nVariable name\tDescription\naction_url\tThe URL the user will be redirected to after visiting the link.\napp.domain_name\tThe domain name of the application.\napp.logo_image_url\tThe URL of the logo image of the application.\napp.name\tThe name of the application.\ninvitation.expires_in_days\tThe number of days until the invitation expires.\ninvitation.public_metadata\tThe public metadata of the invitation.\ninviter.name\tThe name of the user who invited the recipient.\nEdit email templates\n\nTo access the email templates:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Emails⁠ page.\nSelect a template to edit.\nOnce you have selected a template, you will be presented with template operations, the template settings, and the WYSIWYG editor.\nTemplate operations\n\nThe following operations are available for an email template:\n\nPreview: enables you to get an idea of how the template will render when sent to the recipient. This is useful for sampling your changes without actually having to commit them first. The app_logo and copyright sections (if present) will be replaced with their actual markup in this view.\nCopy: copies the current state of the editor to another instance. This is especially useful for promoting changes from your development or staging environment to production after you have tested them. The copy icon will not appear if there are no other instances available on your application.\nRevert: reverts to the system default template version. This can be useful if you want to start over from scratch.\nReset: undo all changes since the last save by selecting the Reset button at the bottom right of the dashboard.\nEmail template settings\n\nThe following settings can be changed per email template:\n\nDelivered by Clerk: Clerk will deliver your emails using its own Email Service Provider (ESP), which is currently SendGrid⁠. However, if you wish to handle delivery of emails on your own, then you can toggle this setting off. This means that Clerk will no longer be sending this particular email and in order to deliver it yourself, you will need to listen to the emails.created webhook and extract the necessary info from the event payload.\nName: a name for the template on the template listing page. It does not affect the outgoing email in any way.\nFrom: the email address that will be used as the From address in the email header. The format is <local part>@<your-domain>. You can change the local part to a custom value. If no value is provided, it defaults noreply.\nReply-To: the email address that will be used as the Reply-To address in the email header. This is useful if you want to direct replies to a different email address than the one used in the From field. The format is <local part>@<your-domain>. You can change the local part to a custom value. If no value is provided, the Reply-To header will be omitted.\nSubject: the subject line of the email.\nEmail WYSIWYG editor\n\nThe email WYSIWYG editor is split into two parts:\n\nThe toolbar\nThe text area\nToolbar controls\n\nThe toolbar is located at the top of the editor and contains the following controls, in order from left to right:\n\nShortcut button\nMobile view toggle\nHTML mode toggle - For this tool to appear, you will need to unselect any currently selected block.\nBackground button\nSettings button\n\nFor the following controls to appear, you will need to select an existing block in the text area. These controls will not be visible otherwise.\n\nAdd block button\nAlignment button\nLink button\nText color button\nVariable button\nBorder button\nText area controls\n\nThe email WYSIWYG editor text area is intended mainly for authoring content. Though, if you select a block, a set of tools will also appear. In order from top to bottom, these are:\n\nMove handle\nDelete\nClone\nEdit SMS templates\n\nTo access the SMS templates:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SMS⁠ page.\nSelect a template to edit. You can also disable certain SMS notifications.\nYou'll be redirected to the template's page where you can see what the template looks like. To customize the content of an SMS message, you must deliver it yourself; see the Delivered by Clerk section for more information.\nDelivered by Clerk\n\nClerk will deliver your SMS messages using its own SMS Gateway. However, if you wish to handle SMS delivery on your own, then you can toggle Delivered by Clerk off.\n\nThis means that Clerk will no longer be sending this particular SMS and in order to deliver it yourself, you will need to listen to the sms.created webhook and extract the necessary info from the event payload.\n\nNote\n\nRemember, this is a per-template setting and will not be applied to other templates.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

If you encounter any issues, contact support⁠ with as much detail as possible.\n\nClerk offers the ability to override the strings for all of the elements in each of the Clerk components. This allows you to provide localization for your users or change the wording to suit your brand.\n\n@clerk/localizations\n\nThe @clerk/localizations package contains predefined localizations for the Clerk components.\n\nLanguages\n\nClerk currently supports the following languages with English as the default:\n\nEnglish name\tLanguage tag (BCP 47)\tKey\nArabic (Saudi)\tar-SA\tarSA\nBelarus\tbe-BY\tbeBY\nBengali\tbn-IN\tbnIN\nBulgarian\tbg-BG\tbgBG\nCatalan\tca-ES\tcaES\nChinese (Simplified)\tzh-CN\tzhCN\nChinese (Traditional)\tzh-TW\tzhTW\nCroatian\thr-HR\thrHR\nCzech\tcs-CZ\tcsCZ\nDanish\tda-DK\tdaDK\nDutch\tnl-BE\tnlBE\nDutch\tnl-NL\tnlNL\nEnglish (GB)\ten-GB\tenGB\nEnglish (US)\ten-US\tenUS\nFarsi\tfa-IR\tfaIR\nFinnish\tfi-FI\tfiFI\nFrench\tfr-FR\tfrFR\nGerman\tde-DE\tdeDE\nGreek\tel-GR\telGR\nHebrew\the-IL\theIL\nHindi\thi-IN\thiIN\nHungarian\thu-HU\thuHU\nIcelandic\tis-IS\tisIS\nItalian\tit-IT\titIT\nIndonesian\tid-ID\tidID\nJapanese\tja-JP\tjaJP\nKazakh\tkk-KZ\tkkKZ\nKorean\tko-KR\tkoKR\nMalay\tms-MY\tmsMY\nMongolian\tmn-MN\tmnMN\nNorwegian\tnb-NO\tnbNO\nPolish\tpl-PL\tplPL\nPortuguese (BR)\tpt-BR\tptBR\nPortuguese (PT)\tpt-PT\tptPT\nRomanian\tro-RO\troRO\nRussian\tru-RU\truRU\nSerbian\tsr-RS\tsrRS\nSlovak\tsk-SK\tskSK\nSpanish\tes-ES\tesES\nSpanish (Costa Rica)\tes-CR\tesCR\nSpanish (Mexico)\tes-MX\tesMX\nSpanish (Uruguay)\tes-UY\tesUY\nSwedish\tsv-SE\tsvSE\nTamil\tta-IN\ttaIN\nTelugu\tte-IN\tteIN\nThai\tth-TH\tthTH\nTurkish\ttr-TR\ttrTR\nUkrainian\tuk-UA\tukUA\nVietnamese\tvi-VN\tviVN\nUsage\n\nCaution\n\nThe localizations will only update the text in the \nClerk components\n used in your application. The hosted Clerk Account Portal will remain in English.\n\nTo get started, install the @clerk/localizations package.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm install @clerk/localizations\n\nOnce the @clerk/localizations package is installed, you can import the localizations you need by removing the \"-\" from the locale. You can then pass the localization to the localization prop.\n\nTo apply a localization, pass the appearance prop to the \n<ClerkProvider>\n component. The appearance prop accepts the property localization, which can be set to the imported localization.\n\nIn the following example, the fr-FR locale is imported as frFR and applied to all Clerk components.\n\n// fr-FR locale is imported as frFR\nimport { frFR } from '@clerk/localizations'\n\n<ClerkProvider localization={frFR}>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\nAdding or updating a localization\n\nClerk's localizations are customer-sourced and we encourage customers to add or update localizations. To do so, follow these steps:\n\nFork the https://github.com/clerk/javascript/⁠ repo.\nClone it locally to edit it.\nReview Clerk's Contributing⁠ guide.\nIf you are updating an existing localization locate the file in packages/localizations/src\nIf you are adding a new language, copy the en-US.ts file and name it according to your language. The naming is the abbreviated language-region. For example, for French in Canada, it would be fr-CA.ts.\nGo through the file and edit the entries.\nIf you are adding a new localization, add the language to the packages/localizations/src/index.ts file.\nCommit your changes to git and push them to your fork. Create a Pull Request⁠ from your fork to Clerk's repo against the main branch. We will review and either approve or ask for updates.\nCustom localizations\n\nYou can also provide your own localizations for the Clerk components. This is useful if you want to provide limited or quick localization for a language Clerk doesn't currently support, adjust the wording to match your brand, or customize default error messages.\n\nFirst, you need to find the key for the element that you want to customize. To find the key for your translation, open up Clerk's English localization file⁠. Search the file for the term that you want to customize.\n\nFor example, say you want to change the text of the \"Continue\" button on the <SignIn /> component to say \"LETS GO!\". In this case, you'd search for \"Continue\". The first result that comes up is formButtonPrimary, which is the key for the \"Continue\" button.\n\nNow that you know the key, you can pass it to the localization prop and set the value to the text you want to display. In this case, you'd set the value to \"LETS GO!\", as shown in the following example.\n\n// Set your customizations in a `localization` object\nconst localization = {\n  formButtonPrimary: 'LETS GO!',\n}\n\n<ClerkProvider localization={localization}>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\n\nYou can also customize multiple entries by passing multiple keys. The following example updates the \"to continue to\" subtitles on the <SignUp /> component to say \"to access\" instead.\n\nconst localization = {\n  signUp: {\n    start: {\n      subtitle: 'to access {{applicationName}}',\n    },\n    emailCode: {\n      subtitle: 'to access {{applicationName}}',\n    },\n  },\n}\n\n<ClerkProvider localization={localization}>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\nCustomize error messages\n\nYou can customize Clerk's default error messages by targeting the unstable__errors key. This key lets you define specific error keys for different error types and assign them custom message strings. You can find the full list of error keys in the English localization file⁠. Search for the unstable__errors object to find the keys you can customize.\n\nThe following example updates the not_allowed_access error message. This message appears when a user tries to sign in with an email domain that isn't allowed to access your application.\n\nconst localization = {\n  unstable__errors: {\n  not_allowed_access:\n    'Send us an email if you want your corporate email domain allowlisted for access',\n  },\n}\n\n<ClerkProvider localization={localization}>\n  {/* ... */}\n</ClerkProvider>\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

We're actively building a replacement for Clerk Elements with a different approach to customization, and we'll share more details soon.\n\nClerk Elements is a library of unstyled, composable components that can be used to build custom UIs on top of the Clerk APIs without having to manage the underlying logic.\n\nWhy use Clerk Elements?\n\nYou should use Clerk Elements if you want a deeper level of control and customization of the styles and layout of your UI while using the Clerk APIs. For example, if \nthe appearance prop\n does not meet your needs, Clerk Elements might be for you. That said, you can also use Clerk Elements alongside the prebuilt components.\n\nComponent-first - Make it as easy to build custom UIs with Clerk as it is with Clerk's drop-in prebuilt components. Clerk Elements handles the underlying business logic for you and provides a curated library of components without sacrificing on best practices or features.\nUnstyled, with a little bit of magic - Use the web platform and best-in-class components for building great authentication flows. Baked-in to the components are little bits of magic, like the fully accessible segmented one-time password (OTP)⁠ input, and instant password validation during sign up.\nIntegrate Clerk Elements into your workflow\n\nClerk Elements can be integrated into your existing application and workflows. For example, you may want to use Clerk Elements with:\n\nTailwind CSS – If you use Tailwind CSS, you can pass a className prop to most elements that Clerk Elements renders. See the styling guide to learn more.\nExisting styles or component library – If you have an existing component library that you want to use to build your authentication UIs, Clerk Elements supports composition via an asChild prop. Read the styling guide to learn more.\nWith prebuilt components - Continue using prebuilt components while customizing the flows you care most about.\nGetting started\n\nClerk Elements currently only works with Next.js App Router and Clerk Core 2⁠. As it gets closer to a stable release, support for additional frameworks will be added. If your Next.js application is already using Clerk, make sure to upgrade to Core 2. If you're starting from scratch, follow the \nNext.js quickstart\n before proceeding.\n\nTo get started, install the Clerk Elements package:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm install @clerk/elements\n\nImportant\n\nIf your project uses TypeScript, make sure that your moduleResolution⁠ in tsconfig.json is set to bundler. Otherwise, you might run into issues with resolving TypeScript types from Clerk Elements.\n\nOnce you have your project set up, you can start building custom UIs with Clerk Elements using Clerk's guides and examples. For example, to use Clerk Elements to build a custom sign-in flow, you can explore:\n\nBuild a sign-in flow\nSign-in examples\nSign-in components\n\nNote\n\nWith the beta release, only sign-up and sign-in flows are supported. Support for building the rest of the prebuilt components with Elements is actively being worked on.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The route needs to be an optional catch-all route⁠ so the sign-in flow can handled nested paths, as shown in the following example:\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return <SignIn.Root>[Sign In Root]</SignIn.Root>\n}\n\nYou will use these two imports to build out the rest of the flow. <SignIn.Root> manages the sign-in state and handles connecting the components to Clerk's APIs.\n\nTip\n\nIf you're getting TypeScript errors on the @clerk/elements imports you probably have forgotten to set your moduleResolution⁠ in tsconfig.json to bundler.\n\nAdd the start step\n\nThe Clerk authentication flows are made up of steps. Steps handle rendering the UI for each part of the flow. To allow users to create a sign-in attempt, the start step needs to be rendered. The following example does so with the <SignIn.Step> component:\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n        <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\nAdd form fields\n\nMake it functional by adding input fields. The following example uses the <Clerk.Field> component to render an identifier field, as well as the <Connection> component to allow users to sign in with a social connection, like Google:\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n        <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>\n\n        <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>\n\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\">\n          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input />\n          <Clerk.FieldError />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n\n        <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\n\n<Clerk.Field> takes care of wiring up the input with the label element, and <Clerk.FieldError> will render any field-specific errors that get returned from Clerk's API. The <SignIn.Action> component provides common actions that are used throughout the flows. In this case, using the submit action to render a submit button for the start form.\n\nNote\n\nIf your Clerk instance supports signing in with Google and doesn't require multi-factor authentication (MFA), you should be able to complete a sign-in with the components rendered so far.\n\nAdd verification\n\nAs users progress through a sign-in attempt, they may be asked to verify a number of authentication factors in the verifications step. You can render a form for the user to complete verification, but each verification strategy requires different fields. You must render the form fields conditionally for each authentication strategy your instance supports using the <SignIn.Strategy> component.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to conditionally render a form for the email_code strategy:\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n        <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>\n\n        <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>\n\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\">\n          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input />\n          <Clerk.FieldError />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n\n        <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"verifications\">\n        <SignIn.Strategy name=\"email_code\">\n          <h1>Check your email</h1>\n          <p>\n            We sent a code to <SignIn.SafeIdentifier />.\n          </p>\n\n          <Clerk.Field name=\"code\">\n            <Clerk.Label>Email code</Clerk.Label>\n            <Clerk.Input />\n            <Clerk.FieldError />\n          </Clerk.Field>\n\n          <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>\n        </SignIn.Strategy>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\n\nVerification is the final step in the sign-in flow. When a user has verified all required factors, the sign-in attempt will be complete and they will be signed in.\n\nAdd password support\n\nIf your instance is configured to support authenticating with passwords, you must add a few additional steps and verification strategies. You can choose if you want to support providing a password in the start step with an additional field, or as an additional verification strategy. For this guide, add it as a standalone verification strategy.\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n        <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>\n\n        <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>\n\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\">\n          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input />\n          <Clerk.FieldError />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n\n        <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"verifications\">\n        <SignIn.Strategy name=\"email_code\">\n          <h1>Check your email</h1>\n          <p>\n            We sent a code to <SignIn.SafeIdentifier />.\n          </p>\n\n          <Clerk.Field name=\"code\">\n            <Clerk.Label>Email code</Clerk.Label>\n            <Clerk.Input />\n            <Clerk.FieldError />\n          </Clerk.Field>\n\n          <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>\n        </SignIn.Strategy>\n\n        <SignIn.Strategy name=\"password\">\n          <h1>Enter your password</h1>\n\n          <Clerk.Field name=\"password\">\n            <Clerk.Label>Password</Clerk.Label>\n            <Clerk.Input />\n            <Clerk.FieldError />\n          </Clerk.Field>\n\n          <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>\n          <SignIn.Action navigate=\"forgot-password\">Forgot password?</SignIn.Action>\n        </SignIn.Strategy>\n\n        <SignIn.Strategy name=\"reset_password_email_code\">\n          <h1>Check your email</h1>\n          <p>\n            We sent a code to <SignIn.SafeIdentifier />.\n          </p>\n\n          <Clerk.Field name=\"code\">\n            <Clerk.Label>Email code</Clerk.Label>\n            <Clerk.Input />\n            <Clerk.FieldError />\n          </Clerk.Field>\n\n          <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>\n        </SignIn.Strategy>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"forgot-password\">\n        <h1>Forgot your password?</h1>\n\n        <SignIn.SupportedStrategy name=\"reset_password_email_code\">\n          Reset password\n        </SignIn.SupportedStrategy>\n\n        <SignIn.Action navigate=\"previous\">Go back</SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"reset-password\">\n        <h1>Reset your password</h1>\n\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"password\">\n          <Clerk.Label>New password</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input />\n          <Clerk.FieldError />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"confirmPassword\">\n          <Clerk.Label>Confirm password</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input />\n          <Clerk.FieldError />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n\n        <SignIn.Action submit>Reset password</SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\n\nTo enable users to reset their passwords, you can add the following additional steps:\n\nforgot-password – Renders <SignIn.SupportedStrategy>, which initiates the reset process, whereby an email code is sent to the user for verification.\n<SignIn.SupportedStrategy> is also used in the forgot-password and choose-strategy steps to trigger verification of a supported strategy.\nreset-password – Allows a verified user to input a new password. If your instance has been set up to accept SMS codes, you can also use reset_password_phone_code.\n\nNote\n\nIf your instance isn't configured to use passwords, or any of the strategies outlined here, Clerk Elements will log a warning to the console during development.\n\nCustomize and add styling\n\nLearn how to style your Clerk Elements components with the styling guide.\n\nFor more extensive customization of the UI, see the additional Clerk Elements components such as <Loading> and <FieldState>.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The easiest way to implement Clerk is with our \nall-in-one UI components\n.\nClerk Elements currently only works with Next.js App Router and Clerk Core 2⁠.\n\nYou can style Clerk Elements components with the following props:\n\nclassName – Can be used on any Clerk Elements component that renders markup.\nasChild – Can be used to change the rendered element entirely.\n\nThis guide will demonstrate multiple different styling approaches using the following basic sign-in flow as a starting point:\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n        <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\">\n          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input />\n          <Clerk.FieldError />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n        <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"verifications\">\n        <SignIn.Strategy name=\"email_code\">\n          <Clerk.Field name=\"code\">\n            <Clerk.Label>Code</Clerk.Label>\n            <Clerk.Input />\n            <Clerk.FieldError />\n          </Clerk.Field>\n          <SignIn.Action submit>Verify</SignIn.Action>\n        </SignIn.Strategy>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\nTailwind CSS\n\nIf you are already using Tailwind CSS⁠, no additional setup is required. Classes from Tailwind can be applied to most Clerk Elements components. Use your editor's IntelliSense to see if className is a valid prop on a component you want to style.\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step\n        name=\"start\"\n        className=\"bg-white w-96 rounded-2xl py-10 px-8 shadow-sm border space-y-6\"\n      >\n        <div className=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-4\">\n          <Clerk.Connection\n            name=\"google\"\n            className=\"flex items-center gap-x-3 justify-center font-medium border shadow-sm py-1.5 px-2.5 rounded-md\"\n          >\n            <Clerk.Icon className=\"size-4\" />\n            Google\n          </Clerk.Connection>\n          <Clerk.Connection\n            name=\"github\"\n            className=\"flex items-center gap-x-3 justify-center font-medium border shadow-sm py-1.5 px-2.5 rounded-md\"\n          >\n            <Clerk.Icon className=\"size-4\" />\n            GitHub\n          </Clerk.Connection>\n        </div>\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\" className=\"space-y-2\">\n          <Clerk.Label className=\"text-sm font-medium\">Email</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input className=\"w-full border rounded-md py-1.5 px-2.5\" />\n          <Clerk.FieldError className=\"block text-red-500 text-sm\" />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n        <SignIn.Action submit className=\"bg-black text-white rounded-md py-1.5 px-2.5\">\n          Continue\n        </SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\nWith existing components via asChild\n\nMany of the Clerk Elements components accept an asChild prop that allows you to swap out the rendered element. This is useful if you have an existing design system or component library that you wish to use with Clerk Elements.\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nimport { Button } from '@components/button'\nimport { Input } from '@components/input'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n        <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\" asChild>\n          <Button>Sign in with Google</Button>\n        </Clerk.Connection>\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\">\n          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input asChild>\n            <Input />\n          </Clerk.Input>\n          <Clerk.FieldError />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n        <SignIn.Action submit asChild>\n          <Button>Continue</Button>\n        </SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"verifications\">\n        <SignIn.Strategy name=\"email_code\">\n          <Clerk.Field name=\"code\">\n            <Clerk.Label>Code</Clerk.Label>\n            <Clerk.Input asChild>\n              <Input />\n            </Clerk.Input>\n            <Clerk.FieldError />\n          </Clerk.Field>\n          <SignIn.Action submit asChild>\n            <Button>Continue</Button>\n          </SignIn.Action>\n        </SignIn.Strategy>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\n\nNotice how the Clerk Elements components are wrapping the rendered <Input> and <Button> when asChild is used. This ensures the underlying event handlers and necessary props are passed along automatically.\n\nConfigure your components for asChild\n\nTo use the asChild prop, your component must spread its incoming props and return forwardRef()⁠. Here's an example of how you might implement a custom <Input /> component:\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react'\n\nconst CustomInput = forwardRef(function CustomInput(props, forwardedRef) {\n  return <input ref={forwardedRef} {...props} className=\"custom-class\" />\n})\nCSS Modules\n\nClasses from an imported CSS module can be applied to most Clerk Elements components with className.\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\nimport styles from './sign-in.module.css'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"start\" className={styles.startStep}>\n        <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\" className={styles.provider}>\n          Sign in with Google\n        </Clerk.Connection>\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\">\n          <Clerk.Label className={styles.label}>Email</Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input className={styles.input} />\n          <Clerk.FieldError className={styles.error} />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n        <SignIn.Action submit className={styles.submit}>\n          Continue\n        </SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n      <SignIn.Step name=\"verifications\" className={styles.verificationsStep}>\n        <SignIn.Strategy name=\"email_code\">\n          <Clerk.Field name=\"code\">\n            <Clerk.Label className={styles.label}>Code</Clerk.Label>\n            <Clerk.Input className={styles.input} />\n            <Clerk.FieldError className={styles.error} />\n          </Clerk.Field>\n          <SignIn.Action submit className={styles.submit}>\n            Verify\n          </SignIn.Action>\n        </SignIn.Strategy>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\nInline styles\n\nYou can also use inline styles with Clerk Elements. This is useful when you need to apply styles conditionally or avoid creating a separate CSS file.\n\napp/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\nimport * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <SignIn.Root>\n      <SignIn.Step\n        name=\"start\"\n        style={{\n          backgroundColor: 'white',\n          padding: '1rem',\n          border: '1px solid #dddddd',\n          borderRadius: '4px',\n        }}\n      >\n        <Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\">\n          <Clerk.Label\n            style={{\n              color: '#dddddd',\n              fontSize: '0.875rem',\n            }}\n          >\n            Email\n          </Clerk.Label>\n          <Clerk.Input\n            style={{\n              border: '1px solid #dddddd',\n              borderRadius: '4px',\n              padding: '1rem',\n            }}\n          />\n        </Clerk.Field>\n        <SignIn.Action\n          submit\n          style={{\n            backgroundColor: '#111111',\n            color: 'white',\n            padding: '1rem',\n            borderRadius: '4px',\n          }}\n        >\n          Continue\n        </SignIn.Action>\n      </SignIn.Step>\n    </SignIn.Root>\n  )\n}\nState-based styling\n\nIn some cases you might want to style components based on their state. Clerk Elements exposes data attributes for this purpose, as well as components that expose the state programmatically to support more complex logic.\n\nData attributes\n\n<Field> and <Input> can be styled based on their validity state by targeting the data-valid or data-invalid attributes:\n\nstyle.css\n.input {\n  --border-color: gray;\n  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);\n\n  &[data-invalid] {\n    --border-color: red;\n  }\n}\npage.tsx\n<Clerk.Input className=\"input\" />\nFunction as children\n\nIf you need programmatic access to state for more complex styling, several components accept a function as children. This is useful when dealing with animations, or for conditionally rendering elements based on state.\n\nFor example, to access a field's state, use <FieldState>.\n\npage.tsx\n<Clerk.Field name=\"email\">\n  <Clerk.FieldState>{(state) => state === 'invalid' && <ErrorIcon />}</Clerk.FieldState>\n  <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>\n  <Clerk.Input />\n  <Clerk.FieldError />\n</Clerk.Field>\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

We're actively building a replacement for Clerk Elements with a different approach to customization, and we'll share more details soon.\n\nClerk Elements provides a set of common components that are used across all flows. It's recommended to import them all under the Clerk namespace to make discovery easier and reduce naming conflicts with other common components throughout your application. The code snippets on this page assume you have imported the components this way.\n\nAnatomy\nimport * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned, all components accept a className prop.\n\n<Connection>\n\nRenders a social connection button based on the provided name. Throws an error in development if the provided social connection is not enabled in your instance. See Social connections (OAuth) to learn how to enable them in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nBy default, <Connection> will be rendered as an unstyled <button>.\n\nProperties\nName\nasChild\nType\nboolean (optional)\nDescription\n\nIf true, <Connection> will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: false\n\nName\nname\nType\nstring\nDescription\n\nName of the social connection to render.\n\nUsage\npage.tsx\n<SignIn.Root>\n  <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n    <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>\n  </SignIn.Step>\n</SignIn.Root>\n\nYou can enrich this example by providing an <Icon> to display the social connection's logo.\n\n<Field>\n\nAssociates its child elements with a specific <Input>. It automatically generates unique IDs and associates child <Label> and <Input> elements with each other.\n\nProperties\nName\nname\nType\n'code' | 'confirmPassword' | 'currentPassword' | 'emailAddress' | 'firstName' | 'identifier' | 'lastName' | 'name' | 'newPassword' | 'password' | 'phoneNumber' | 'username'\nDescription\n\nName for form field, will be used to associate all underlying field elements.\n\nName\nalwaysShow?\nType\nboolean\nDescription\n\nWhen true, the field will always be rendered, regardless of its state. When false, the field is hidden if it's optional or if it's a filled-out required field. Default: false\n\nName\nchildren?\nType\n(state: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info' | 'idle') => React.ReactNode\nDescription\n\nProvide a function as children and access the field's state.\n\nUsage\n\nPlace common components like <Input>, <FieldError>, or <Label> inside <Field>.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"unique-name\">{/* Your content */}</Clerk.Field>\nFunction as children\n\nThe state you can access here is the same as in <FieldState>.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"unique-name\">{(state) => <p>Field's state is: {state}</p>}</Clerk.Field>\n<FieldError>\n\nRenders error messages associated with a specific <Field>. By default, the error's message will be rendered in an unstyled <span>. Optionally, the children prop accepts a function to customize rendering.\n\nProperties\nName\nname?\nType\nstring\nDescription\n\nUsed to target a specific field by name when rendering outside of a <Field> component. Default: Automatically inferred\n\nName\nasChild?\nType\nboolean\nDescription\n\nIf true, <FieldError> will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: false\n\nName\nchildren?\nType\n({ message: string, code: string }) => React.ReactNode\nDescription\n\nProvide a function as children and access the error's message and code.\n\nUsage\n\nIf the <Field> is in an error state, <FieldError> will display its message.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"unique-name\">\n  <Clerk.FieldError />\n</Clerk.Field>\nFunction as children\n\nBy having access to both message and code you can enrich the incoming message or localize it by checking for a specific code.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"unique-name\">\n  <Clerk.FieldError>\n    {({ message, code }) => (\n      <span>\n        {message} ({code})\n      </span>\n    )}\n  </Clerk.FieldError>\n</Clerk.Field>\n<FieldState>\n\nEnables you to programmatically access additional information from the parent <Field> component. By default, you'll have access to state. state will also contain the field's ValidityState⁠. <FieldState> is useful for implementing animations if you need direct access to the state value.\n\nIf you use <Input type=\"password\" validatePassword>, additional information in the form of message and codes is provided.\n\nProperties\nName\nchildren\nType\n(args: { state: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info' | 'idle'; message: string | undefined; codes: (string | [string, Record<string, string | number>])[] | undefined }) => React.ReactNode\nDescription\n\nUse this function to access the field's state. Optionally, information regarding password validation is given.\n\nUsage\n\n<Input> will start with a state of idle until the user interacts with it. Depending on the user's input, the state will change to success or error.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"emailAddress\">\n  <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>\n  <Clerk.Input />\n  <Clerk.FieldState>{({ state }) => <p>Field's state is: {state}</p>}</Clerk.FieldState>\n</Clerk.Field>\n<Input type=\"password\" validatePassword>\n\nIf you're using <Input type=\"password\" validatePassword>, the <FieldState>'s children function receives additional arguments:\n\nName\nmessage\nType\nstring\nDescription\n\nThe standardized English message generated for the current state of the input. This message is generated based on the codes associated with the <FieldState>.\n\nName\ncodes\nType\n(string | [string, Record<string, string | number>])[]\nDescription\n\nThe error codes associated with the <FieldState>. You can use these codes to return a custom message or localize its contents.\n\nInitially, the <Input> will have a state of idle until the user interacts with the input. Depending on the user's input, the state will change to 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info'.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"password\">\n  <Clerk.Label>Password</Clerk.Label>\n  <Clerk.Input type=\"password\" validatePassword />\n  <Clerk.FieldState>\n    {({ state, codes, message }) => (\n      <div>\n        <pre>Field state: {state}</pre>\n        <pre>Field msg: {message}</pre>\n        <pre>Codes: {JSON.stringify(codes, null, 2)}</pre>\n      </div>\n    )}\n  </Clerk.FieldState>\n</Clerk.Field>\n<GlobalError />\n\nRenders errors that are returned from Clerk's API but are not associated with a specific form field. By default, renders the error's message wrapped in a <div>. Optionally, the children prop accepts a function to customize rendering. Must be a child of components like <SignIn>/<SignUp> to have access to the underlying form state.\n\nProperties\nName\nasChild?\nType\nboolean\nDescription\n\nIf true, <GlobalError> will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: false\n\nName\ncode?\nType\nstring\nDescription\n\nForces the message with the matching code to be shown. This is useful when using server-side validation. Default: undefined\n\nName\nchildren?\nType\n({ message: string, code: string }) => React.ReactNode\nDescription\n\nProvide a function as children and access the error's message and code.\n\nUsage\npage.tsx\n<SignIn.Root>\n  <Clerk.GlobalError />\n</SignIn.Root>\nFunction as children\n\nBy having access to both message and code you can enrich the incoming message or localize it by checking for specific code.\n\npage.tsx\n<SignIn.Root>\n  <Clerk.GlobalError>\n    {({ message, code }) => (\n      <span>\n        {message} ({code})\n      </span>\n    )}\n  </Clerk.GlobalError>\n</SignIn.Root>\n<Icon>\n\nBy default, renders as an <img> element with the logo of the parent <Connection> as the value of its src prop. Must be a child of <Connection>.\n\nTip\n\n<Icon> is designed to give you access to Clerk's social connection logos and has intentionally limited customizability. If you need more customizability, consider options such as Iconify⁠.\n\nProperties\nName\nasChild?\nType\nboolean\nDescription\n\nIf true, <Icon> will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: false\n\nUsage\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to render the Google social connection logo with <Icon>:\n\npage.tsx\n<SignIn.Root>\n  <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n    <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\">\n      <Clerk.Icon />\n      Sign in with Google\n    </Clerk.Connection>\n  </SignIn.Step>\n</SignIn.Root>\n<Input>\n\nHandles rendering of <input /> elements⁠ within Clerk's flows. Supports special type prop values to render input types that are unique to authentication and user management flows. Additional props will be passed through to the <input />.\n\nNote\n\nFor screen reader accessibility, always associate a <Label> with your <Input> elements.\n\nProperties\nName\nasChild?\nType\nboolean\nDescription\n\nIf true, <Input> will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: false\n\nName\nname?\nType\nstring\nDescription\n\nName for the form field. Will be used to associate all underlying field elements. Can be automatically inferred from the name on the <Field> component.\n\nName\ntype?\nType\n'text' | 'email' | 'tel' | 'otp'* | 'password'\nDescription\n\nType for the input. Default: 'text'\n\nName\nautoComplete?\nType\nstring\nDescription\n\nRefers to the HTML attribute⁠. If <Input> is used inside a <SignIn> flow and autoComplete=\"webauthn\" is set, passkey autofill⁠ will be attempted.\n\nNote\n\nValues denoted with * are unique Clerk input types.\n\nThe following data attributes are also added to the underlying element:\n\ndata-valid - If the field state is valid\ndata-invalid - If the field state is invalid (Either the ValidityState⁠ or has an associated error from Clerk's API)\ndate-state - Refers to the <FieldState> status\ndata-has-value - If the input has a value\nUsage\n<Clerk.Field name=\"identifier\">\n  <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>\n  <Clerk.Input type=\"email\" />\n</Clerk.Field>\n<Input type=\"otp\">\n\nA special type used to render an input that accepts a one-time password (OTP)⁠. If the corresponding <Field> has name=\"code\", the child <Input> will default to the otp type. Only numbers are accepted as inputs, and the default max length is 6.\n\nBy default, a single text <input /> will be rendered. If provided, the render prop will be called for each character present in the input. This enables UI patterns where an OTP input is visually represented as N distinct elements.\n\nProperties\nName\nlength?\nType\nnumber\nDescription\n\nSets how many digits the input number can be. Default: 6\n\nName\nautoSubmit?\nType\nboolean\nDescription\n\nIf true, the form will be automatically submitted once the input is filled out. Default: false\n\nName\npasswordManagerOffset?\nType\nnumber\nDescription\n\nPassword managers place their icon inside an <input />. This default behaviour is not desirable when you use the render prop to display N distinct element. With this prop you can increase the width of the <input /> so that the icon is rendered outside the OTP inputs. Default: 40\n\nName\nrender?\nType\n({ value, status }: { value: string; status: 'none' | 'selected' | 'cursor' | 'hovered' }) => React.ReactNode\nDescription\n\nA render prop function that receives the value and status of each character. value is the character to render, status is the current status of the input character.\n\nThe properties asChild and name from <Input> also apply to <Input type=\"otp\">.\n\nThe following data attributes are also added to the underlying element:\n\ndata-otp-input\nUsage\n\nA single <input type=\"text\" /> input that only allows 6 numbers to be entered. Once the user filled in all information, the form is automatically submitted.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"code\">\n  <Clerk.Input type=\"otp\" autoSubmit />\n</Clerk.Field>\nSegmented\n\nYou can render each number into an individual item and animate its appearance depending on the status.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"code\">\n  <Clerk.Input\n    type=\"otp\"\n    passwordManagerOffset={40}\n    render={({ value, status }) => <span data-status={status}>{value}</span>}\n  />\n</Clerk.Field>\n<Input type=\"password\">\n\nA thin wrapper around the <input type=\"password\" /> element⁠ to provide password validation logic. You can define password rules in the Clerk Dashboard. By default, this validation is turned off and you need to set a validatePassword prop.\n\nOnce activated, you can access the instant validation feedback through <FieldState> and display rich information to your users.\n\nProperties\nName\nvalidatePassword?\nType\nboolean\nDescription\n\nIf true, password validation according to your password rules is happening while the user types in their password. Default: false\n\nThe following data attributes are also added to the underlying Element if validatePassword is true:\n\ndata-has-passed-validation - If the password has passed the validation or not\n\nThe existing data attributes from <Input> are also present on this Element.\n\nUsage\n\nFor more information on how to use state, codes, and message check the <FieldState> docs.\n\n<Clerk.Field name=\"password\">\n  <Clerk.Label>Password</Clerk.Label>\n  <Clerk.Input type=\"password\" validatePassword />\n  <Clerk.FieldState>\n    {({ state, codes, message }) => (\n      <div>\n        <pre>Field state: {state}</pre>\n        <pre>Field msg: {message}</pre>\n        <pre>Codes: {codes?.join(', ')}</pre>\n      </div>\n    )}\n  </Clerk.FieldState>\n</Clerk.Field>\n<Label>\n\nRenders a <label> element that is automatically associated with its sibling <Input /> inside of a <Field>. Additional props will be passed through to the <label> element⁠.\n\nProperties\nName\nasChild?\nType\nboolean\nDescription\n\nIf true, <Label /> will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: false\n\nUsage\n<Clerk.Field name=\"unique-name\">\n  <Clerk.Label>Label</Clerk.Label>\n</Clerk.Field>\nWith asChild\n<Clerk.Field name=\"unique-name\">\n  <Clerk.Label asChild>\n    <label className=\"my-custom-label\">Label</label>\n  </Clerk.Label>\n</Clerk.Field>\n<Loading>\n\nEnables you to access the loading state of a chosen scope. Scope can refer to a step, a <Connection>, or the global loading state. The global loading state is true when any of the other scopes are loading.\n\nProperties\nName\nchildren\nType\n(isLoading: boolean) => React.ReactNode\nDescription\n\nA function that receives isLoading as an argument. isLoading is a boolean that indicates if the current scope is loading or not.\n\nName\nscope?\nType\nstring\nDescription\n\nSpecify which loading state to access. Can be a step, a connection, or the global loading state. If <Loading> is used outside a <Step>, the scope will default to 'global'. If used inside a <Step> the scope will default to the current step. For external authentication providers, the scope needs to be manually defined in the format of provider:<provider name>. Default: 'global'\n\nRelying on the auto-inference of the scope can be helpful when using <Loading> in shared components, which might be referenced inside different steps. You won't need to manually pass the scope as a prop to your shared component.\n\nUsage\npage.tsx\n<SignIn.Root>\n  <Clerk.Loading>\n    {(isGlobalLoading) => (isGlobalLoading ? 'Global Loading...' : 'Global')}\n  </Clerk.Loading>\n  <SignIn.Step name=\"start\">\n    <Clerk.Connection name=\"google\">\n      <Clerk.Loading scope=\"provider:google\">\n        {(isLoading) => (isLoading ?

Authorization is the process of determining the access rights and privileges of a user, ensuring they have the necessary permissions to perform specific actions.\n\nClerk provides two main features that can be used to implement authorization checks:\n\nOrganizations\nUsers can be assigned Roles and Permissions\nUseful for Role-based and Permission-based access control\nBilling\nUsers can subscribe to Plans and Features\nUseful for Subscription-based and Feature-based access control\n\nYou can use either options independently or combine them together depending on your application's needs.\n\nThere are a few methods to perform authorization checks:\n\nThe has() helper (recommended): returns false if the user is unauthorized.\nBenefits: it can be used both client-side and server-side. It offers flexibility and control over the response; if a user is not authorized, you can choose how your app responds.\nLimitations: when checking for Permissions, it only checks for Custom Permissions. To check for System Permissions, you have to verify the user's Role instead, which isn't as flexible.\nThe \n<Protect>\n component: prevents content from rendering if the user is unauthorized.\nBenefits: it can be used both client-side and server-side (in Server Components).\nLimitations: this component only visually hides its children when the current user is not authorized. The contents of its children remain accessible via the browser's source code even if the user fails the authorization check. Do not use this component to hide sensitive information that should be completely inaccessible to unauthorized users. For truly sensitive data, it's recommended to use has() to perform authorization checks on the server before sending the data to the client.\n\nThis guide will show you how to implement authorization checks in order to protect actions, content, or entire routes based on the user's Permissions, but the same concepts can be applied to Roles, Features, and Plans. When calling the has() helper, you would simply replace the permission parameter with the appropriate access control type, such as role, feature, or plan.\n\nImportant considerations\nWhen doing authorization checks, it's recommended to use Permission-based over Role-based, and Feature-based over Plan-based authorization, as these approaches are more granular, flexible, and more secure.\nNote: Using has() on the server-side to check Permissions works only with Custom Permissions, as System Permissions aren't included in the session token claims. To check System Permissions, verify the user's Role instead.\nChecking for a Role or Permission depends on the user having an Active Organization⁠. Without an Active Organization, the authorization checks will likely always evaluate to false by default.\nIf you would like to perform Role-based authorization checks without using Clerk's Organizations feature, see the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) guide.\nIf you have both Organizations and Billing enabled, a Permission check will only work if the Feature part of the Permission key (org:<feature>:<permission>) is a Feature included in the Organization's active Plan. For example, say you want to check if an Organization member has the Custom Permission org:teams:manage, where teams is the Feature. Before performing the authorization check, you need to ensure that the user's Organization is subscribed to a Plan that has the teams Feature. If not, the authorization check will always return false, even if the user has the Custom Permission.\nUse has() for authorization checks\n\nThe has() helper returns false if the user does not have the correct access control. If they aren't authorized, you can choose how your app responds. It can be used to perform authorization checks in pages, route handlers, and Server Actions (Next.js only) to protect them from unauthorized access.\n\nWarning\n\nUsing has() on the server-side to check Permissions works only with Custom Permissions, as System Permissions aren't included in the session token claims. To check System Permissions, verify the user's Role instead.\n\nProtect a page\nProtect a route handler\nProtect a Server Action\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to perform authorization checks in a page in order to protect the content from unauthorized access. It uses has() to check if the user has the org:team_settings:manage Permission.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router, but can be adapted to other frameworks by using the appropriate method for accessing the Auth object.\n\nServer-side\nClient-side\napp/page.tsx\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // Use `auth()` to access the `has()` helper\n  // For other frameworks, use the appropriate method for accessing the `Auth` object\n  const { has } = await auth()\n\n  // Check if the user is authorized\n  const canManage = has({ permission: 'org:team_settings:manage' })\n\n  // If has() returns false, the user does not have the correct permissions\n  // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns null.\n  if (!canManage) return null\n\n  return <h1>Team Settings</h1>\n}\nUse <Protect> for authorization checks\n\nThe \n<Protect>\n component prevents content from rendering if the user does not have the correct access control. If they aren't authorized, you can pass a fallback UI to the fallback prop. Under the hood, it uses the has() helper so it can only check for custom permissions. It can be used both client-side and server-side (in Server Components).\n\nThe following example uses the <Protect> component to only render the content for users with the org:team_settings:manage permission. If they aren't authorized, <Protect> will render the fallback UI that's passed to the fallback prop.\n\napp/page.tsx\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Protect\n      permission=\"org:team_settings:manage\"\n      fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to manage team settings.</p>}\n    >\n      <form>{/* Add UI for managing team settings */}</form>\n    </Protect>\n  )\n}\nAuthorization checks in JavaScript\n\nIf you are not using React-based frameworks, you can use the Clerk JavaScript SDK to perform authorization checks. The following example demonstrates how to use the checkAuthorization() method to check if a user is authorized.\n\nJavaScript\nmain.js\nimport { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js'\n\nconst clerkPubKey = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\n\nconst clerk = new Clerk(clerkPubKey)\nawait clerk.load()\n\n// Check if the user is authenticated\nif (clerk.isSignedIn) {\n  // Check if the user is authorized\n  const canManageSettings = clerk.session.checkAuthorization({\n    permission: 'org:team_settings:manage',\n  })\n}\nAdd custom types\n\nIn order to enhance typesafety in your project, you can define a global ClerkAuthorization interface, which defines the acceptable values for custom access control types.\n\nNote\n\nBy default, Roles and Permissions types, such as OrganizationCustomRoleKey and OrganizationCustomPermissionKey, are assigned string. However, if a ClerkAuthorization type is defined, it will be utilized instead.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to define a global ClerkAuthorization interface with the default Roles that Clerk provides.\n\ntypes/globals.d.ts\nexport {}\n\ndeclare global {\n  interface ClerkAuthorization {\n    permission: ''\n    role: 'org:admin' | 'org:member'\n  }\n}\n\nBecause Clerk supports custom access control types, you can modify ClerkAuthorization to align with the custom access control types configured in your Clerk application. See the following example, where the default Clerk Roles org:admin and org:member are replaced with custom Roles org:super_admin, org:teacher, and org:student, and custom Permissions are also added.\n\ntypes/globals.d.ts\nexport {}\n\ndeclare global {\n  interface ClerkAuthorization {\n    permission: 'org:quiz:create' | 'org:quiz:grade' | 'org:quiz:read' | 'org:quiz:fill'\n    role: 'org:super_admin' | 'org:teacher' | 'org:student'\n  }\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

These options enable you to limit sign-ups, sign-ins, or prevent accounts with specific identifiers, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and even entire domains, from accessing your application.\n\nSign-up modes\n\nClerk supports multiple sign-up modes, giving you flexibility in managing user access to your application:\n\nPublic\nRestricted\nWaitlist\nPublic\n\nIn Public mode, the sign-up process is open to anyone. This mode is the default and is ideal for applications that want broad user access.\n\nRestricted\n\nIn Restricted mode, user access is controlled by the application admin(s). Users can be added to the application through invitations, enterprise connections or manual user creation. This mode is ideal for applications that are in private beta or internal tools.\n\nTo enable this mode:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Restrictions⁠ page.\nToggle on Enable restricted mode and select Save.\n\nAdditional features available in Restricted mode:\n\nThe \n<SignIn />\n component will keep the prompt to sign up hidden by default. This is to avoid confusion for users who don't have access.\n\nThe \n<SignUp />\n is accessible only to users who have been invited and have a valid invitation link. Users who don't have access will see a message indicating that they need an invitation to sign up.\n\nWaitlist\n\nNote\n\nIf you're using Next.js, the \n<Waitlist />\n component is available in @clerk/nextjs@6.2.0 and above.\n\nIn Waitlist mode, users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist. This mode is ideal for apps in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch.\n\nTo enable this mode:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Waitlist⁠ page.\nToggle on Enable waitlist and select Save.\n\nAdditional features available in Waitlist mode:\n\nThe \n<SignIn />\n component will only be accessible to users who have been approved from the waitlist.\n\nThe \n<SignUp />\n is accessible only to users who have been invited and have a valid invitation link. Users who don't have access will see a message indicating that they need an invitation to sign up.\n\nThe \n<Waitlist />\n component provides a form where users can submit their details to join the waitlist. Once approved by admins, users will receive an email with access instructions.\n\nIf you're using the <Waitlist /> component, you must provide the waitlistUrl prop either in the \n<ClerkProvider>\n or \n<SignIn />\n component to ensure proper functionality.\n\nManage waitlist entries\n\nTo manage a user on your waitlist:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Waitlist⁠ page.\nOn the right-side of the user's row, select the menu icon (...).\nSelect Invite to invite the user to your application. Select Deny to deny the user access to your application.\nAllowlist\n\nWarning\n\nThis feature requires a paid plan⁠ for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the pricing⁠ page for more information.\n\nBy adding specific identifiers to the allowlist, only users with those identifiers will be able to sign up to your application, while others will be blocked. This is useful for internal tools, where you want to allow only users with your company domain to have access to the application.\n\nAfter creating an account, users cannot change their identifier to bypass the allowlist, making this feature a secure way to control who can access your application. For example, if you add clerk.dev as an allowed email domain, any user with a @clerk.dev email address can sign up for your application. Email addresses from different domains will not be able to sign up.\n\nNote\n\nAllowlist identifiers are case-insensitive. For example, allowing JOHN.DOE@clerk.dev has the same effect as allowing john.doe@clerk.dev, since identifiers are normalized to lowercase.\n\nTo enable this feature:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Restrictions⁠ page.\nIn the Allowlist tab, toggle on Enable allowlist and select Save.\n\nCaution\n\nEnabling the Allowlist without adding any identifier exceptions blocks all sign-ups.\n\nBlocklist\n\nWarning\n\nThis feature requires a paid plan⁠ for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the pricing⁠ page for more information.\n\nBy adding specific identifiers to the blocklist, you can prevent users with those identifiers from signing up. This helps protect your application from attacks, such as scripts creating multiple spam accounts. For example, adding clerk.dev to the blocked email domains list prevents anyone with an email address ending in @clerk.dev from signing up.\n\nNote\n\nBlocklist identifiers are case-insensitive. For example, blocking JOHN.DOE@clerk.dev has the same effect as blocking john.doe@clerk.dev, since identifiers are normalized to lowercase.\n\nYou can also block email addresses from all subdomains by using *@*.clerk.dev. This prevents sign-ups from email addresses such as @subdomain.clerk.dev or @subdomain2.clerk.dev, and deeper subdomains like @subdomain.subdomain2.clerk.dev.\n\nTo enable this feature:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Restrictions⁠ page.\nIn the Blocklist tab, toggle on Enable blocklist and select Save.\n\nWarning\n\nIn the case that you have enabled the allowlist and the blocklist and have added the same identifier in both, the allowlist takes precedence.\n\nFor additional security, adding an individual email address to the blocklist will also block any attempts to sign up or sign in with the email address modified to contain a subaddress. Subaddresses are identified by the presence of any of the following characters in the local part of the email address: +, #, =.\n\nFor example, if you add john.doe@clerk.dev as a blocked email address, it means that anybody with john.doe@clerk.dev email address will not be able to sign up for your application, including john.doe+anything@clerk.dev and any other subaddress.\n\nBlock email subaddresses\n\nBlock email subaddresses allows you to block all email addresses that contain the characters +, = or # from signing up or being added to existing accounts. For example, an email address like user+sub@clerk.com will be blocked.\n\nNote\n\nExisting accounts with email subaddresses will not be affected by this restriction, and will still be allowed to sign in.\n\nThis feature is designed to prevent malicious sign-in attempts. The first email containing a subaddress will be allowed, but any subsequent sign-ins using additional subaddresses will be blocked.\n\nTo enable this feature:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Restrictions⁠ page.\nToggle on Block email subaddresses and select Save.\nBlock sign-ups that use disposable email addresses\n\nBlock disposable email addresses allows you to block all email addresses that are known to be disposable from signing up for your application. This is useful to prevent spam accounts from signing up.\n\nTo enable this feature:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Restrictions⁠ page.\nToggle on Block sign-ups that use disposable email addresses and select Save.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Criteria to base this decision upon typically revolve around user activity on the application and how long it has been since the user first signed in.\n\nUltimately, picking the ideal session lifetime is a trade-off between security and user experience. Longer sessions are generally better for UX but worse for security; and vice-versa.\n\nFortunately, with Clerk, you have the ability to fully control the lifetime of your users' sessions. There are two settings for doing so and you can set them via your instance settings in the Clerk Dashboard⁠: Inactivity timeout and Maximum lifetime.\n\nNote\n\nNote that either one or both must be enabled at all times. For security reasons, you are not allowed to disable both settings.\n\nInactivity timeout\n\nWarning\n\nThis feature requires a paid plan⁠ for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the pricing⁠ page for more information.\n\nInactivity timeout is the duration after which a session will expire and the user will have to sign in again, if they haven't been active on your site.\n\nA user is considered inactive when the application is closed, or when the app stops refreshing the token.\n\nBy default, this setting is disabled. You can enable it and configure a custom inactivity timeout by following these steps:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\nToggle on Inactivity timeout.\nSet your desired duration.\n\nNote\n\nYou should be aware of browser limitations, which may cause users to be signed out before the configured inactivity timeout.\n\nMaximum lifetime\n\nMaximum lifetime is the duration after which a session will expire and the user will have to sign in again, regardless of their activity on your site.\n\nBy default, this setting is enabled with a default value of 7 days for all newly created instances. Setting a custom maximum lifetime requires a paid plan⁠ for production use, but it's available in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. To find this setting and change the value:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\nToggle on Maximum lifetime.\nSet your desired duration.\n\nNote\n\nYou should be aware of browser limitations, which may cause users to be signed out before the configured maximum lifetime.\n\nBrowser limitations on cookies\n\nRegardless of how session lifetimes are configured, there are certain browser limitations & behaviors which may clear Clerk's session cookie. This will cause users to be signed out, even if your session lifetimes are set to a longer duration. As a result, it is impossible to achieve a setup where your users are never signed out.\n\nUser behaviors\n\nIn the event that a user manually clears their cookies, Clerk's session cookie will be lost. Similarly, if a user signs in via an incognito window and they then close all incognito windows, Clerk's session cookie will be lost. Both of these scenarios will cause the user to have to sign in again.\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\nCookies set in Google Chrome have a Max-Age upper limit of 400 days⁠. Users who are using Google Chrome will be signed out within 400 days, even if session lifetime is set to a longer duration. There is no workaround for this.\n\nThis is per the HTTP Working Group Specification⁠ which is likely to get implemented by other browsers in the near future.\n\nMulti-session applications\n\nA multi-session application is an application that allows multiple accounts to be signed in from the same browser at the same time. The user can switch from one account to another seamlessly. Each account is independent from the rest and has access to different resources.\n\nTo enable multi-session in your application, you need to configure it in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\nToggle on Multi-session handling.\nSelect Save.\nAdd multi-session support to your app\n\nThere are two main ways to add the multi-session feature to your application:\n\nUse the \n<UserButton />\n component if you want to use a prebuilt UI.\nBuild a custom flow if you want to rebuild the existing Clerk flow using the Clerk API.\n\nIt's highly recommended to wrap your application with the following <MultisessionAppSupport /> component. The fragment's key is set to the session ID. Every time the session ID changes, the key changes, forcing React to recreate the entire component tree under the fragment and guaranteeing a full rerendering cycle.\n\nfunction MultisessionAppSupport({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const { session } = useSession()\n\n  return <React.Fragment key={session ? session.id : 'no-users'}>{children}</React.Fragment>\n}\n\nThe following example demonstrates adding multi-session support to a Next.js App Router application. It requires creating the <MultisessionAppSupport /> as a client component, and then using it in the app/layout.tsx file to wrap the entire application. This ensures the layout.tsx remains a server component.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nMultisessionAppSupport.tsx\napp/layout.tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { MultisessionAppSupport } from './components/MultisessionAppSupport'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <ClerkProvider afterMultiSessionSingleSignOutUrl=\"/\">\n        <MultisessionAppSupport>\n          <body>{children}</body>\n        </MultisessionAppSupport>\n      </ClerkProvider>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nSign out behavior\n\nBy default, signing out from a currently active account in a multi-session app will navigate to the sign-in page's /choose route.\n\nIf a sign-in URL is not set, signing out will navigate to Clerk's Account Portal /sign-in/choose page, allowing the user to choose which account to switch into.\n\nIf a sign-in URL is set, either through the \nsignInUrl\n prop on <ClerkProvider> or the CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL environment variable, signing out will navigate to that URL's /choose route. For example, if signInUrl or CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL is set to https://example.com/sign-in, signing out of a multi-session app will navigate to https://example.com/sign-in/choose.\n\nTo redirect to a custom route, pass the \nafterMultiSessionSingleSignOutUrl\n property to <ClerkProvider>.\n\nCustomize session token\n\nSession tokens are JWTs that contain a set of default claims required by Clerk. You can customize these tokens by providing additional claims of your own.\n\nTo learn how to customize session tokens, see the dedicated guide.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

For example, in a banking application, transferring money is considered a \"sensitive action.\" Reverification can be used to confirm the user's identity.\n\nClerk's prebuilt components handle reverification for certain sensitive actions, out of the box. However, this guide will show you how to implement reverification for sensitive actions that are unique to your application.\n\nSensitive actions that require reverification\n\nThe following table shows the sensitive actions that require reverification along with the required strategy and timeframe for each action. When using Clerk's prebuilt components, reverification is automatically handled for these actions.\n\nAction\tStrategy\tTimeframe\nUpdate username\tStrongest available\t10m\nSet/update password\tStrongest available\t10m\nAdd/remove email address\tStrongest available\t10m\nAdd/remove phone number\tStrongest available\t10m\nAdd/remove Web3 Wallet\tStrongest available\t10m\nAdd/remove passkey\tStrongest available\t10m\nSet primary identification\tStrongest available\t10m\nConnect/remove external account\tStrongest available\t10m\nAdd/remove MFA (TOTP, phone number, backup codes)\tStrongest available\t10m\nRevoke session\tStrongest available\t10m\nDelete account\tStrongest available\t10m\nCaveats\n\nBefore enabling this feature, consider the following:\n\nAvailable factors for reverification: Not all authentication factors are supported for reverification. Users can only reverify their credentials using the following factors:\nFirst factors⁠: password, email code, phone code\nSecond factors⁠: phone code, authenticator app, backup code\nGraceful downgrade of verification level: If you request a second_factor or multi_factor level of verification but the user lacks a second factor available, the utilities automatically downgrade the requested level to first_factor.\nEligibility for sensitive actions: Users without any of the above factors cannot reverify. This can be an issue for apps that don't require email addresses to sign up or have disabled email codes in favor of email links.\nHow to require reverification\n\nThe simplest way to require reverification for a sensitive action is to use the \nuseReverification()\n hook. This hook will automatically check if the user has verified their credentials within 10 minutes and if not, displays a modal that prompts the user to verify their credentials. See the \nreference doc\n for more information and comprehensive examples.\n\nHowever, you may have sensitive actions on the server side that you want to require reverification for, such as in a Server Action or Route Handler. In this case, you can use the auth.has() helper to check if the user has verified their credentials within a specific time period. This only does the check on the server side, so you still need to handle reverification on the client side in order for your users to be able to verify their credentials. See the examples below for more information.\n\nHandle reverification server-side\n\nTo handle reverification server-side, use the auth.has() helper to check if the user has verified their credentials within a specific time period. Pass a configuration to set the time period you would like. You can pass one of the following configurations: strict_mfa, strict, moderate, and lax. See the reference doc for details on each configuration.\n\nIf the user hasn't verified their credentials within that time period, return either reverificationError or reverificationErrorResponse, depending on the framework you're using. Use the following tabs to see examples for different frameworks.\n\nNext.js Server Action\nNext.js Route Handler\nRuby on Rails\nOther\n\nThe following example uses the has() helper to check if the user has verified their credentials within a specific time period. The strict configuration sets the time period to 10 minutes. If the user hasn't verified their credentials within 10 minutes, the reverificationError utility is used to return an error.\n\napp/actions.ts\n'use server'\n\nimport { auth, reverificationError } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport const myAction = async () => {\n  const { has } = await auth.protect()\n\n  // Check if the user has *not* verified their credentials within the past 10 minutes\n  const shouldUserRevalidate = !has({ reverification: 'strict' })\n\n  // If the user hasn't reverified, return an error with the matching configuration (e.g. `strict`)\n  if (shouldUserRevalidate) {\n    return reverificationError('strict')\n  }\n\n  // If the user has verified credentials, return a successful response\n  return { success: true }\n}\nHandle reverification client-side\n\nAfter setting up reverification on the server-side, you must handle reverification on the client-side so that your users can verify their credentials.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to use the \nuseReverification()\n hook to detect authorization errors and automatically display a modal that allows the user to verify their identity. Upon successful verification, the previously failed request is automatically retried.\n\nNext.js Server Action\nNext.js Route Handler\nReact\napp/perform-action/page.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useReverification } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { myAction } from '../actions'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const performAction = useReverification(myAction)\n\n  const handleClick = async () => {\n    const myData = await performAction()\n    // If `myData` is null, the user cancelled the reverification process\n    // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns null.\n    if (!myData) return\n  }\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Perform action</button>\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This guide demonstrates how to force MFA for all users by using clerkMiddleware() to intercept all requests and check whether a user has MFA enabled. If the user does not have MFA enabled, clerkMiddleware() redirects them to the /mfa page where they can set up MFA.\n\nEnable MFA in the Clerk Dashboard\n\nIf you haven't already, enable MFA for your users.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Multi-factor⁠ page.\nToggle on the MFA strategies you would like to enable.\nCustomize the session token to include the two_factor_enabled property\n\nEvery User object has a two_factor_enabled property that indicates whether the user has MFA enabled. Store this property in the session token so that you can check it in your clerkMiddleware().\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\nUnder Customize session token, in the Claims editor, enter the following JSON and select Save. The key can be any string, but the value must be the user.two_factor_enabled property, as shown in the following example.

Verifiers SHOULD permit subscriber-chosen memorized secrets at least 64 characters in length. All printing ASCII RFC 20⁠ characters as well as the space character SHOULD be acceptable in memorized secrets. Unicode ISO/IEC 10646⁠ characters SHOULD be accepted as well. To make allowances for likely mistyping, verifiers MAY replace multiple consecutive space characters with a single space character prior to verification, provided that the result is at least 8 characters in length. Truncation of the secret SHALL NOT be performed. For purposes of the above length requirements, each Unicode code point SHALL be counted as a single character.\n\nNIST Special Publication 800-63B⁠\n\nWhile these rules might seem lax independently, NIST's additional compromised password protection guidelines do more to prevent the use of unsafe passwords.\n\nAlso, bear in mind, that passwords are not a requirement for using Clerk. Applications can be configured to use a passwordless strategy that relies on your users being sent one-time passwords⁠ instead.\n\nReject compromised passwords\n\nClerk refers to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines to determine its handling of compromised passwords:\n\nWhen processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised. NIST Special Publication 800-63B⁠\n\nSpecifically, Clerk contracts with HaveIBeenPwned⁠ to compare prospective passwords against its corpus of over 10 billion compromised credentials.\n\nWhen the user provides the correct password, if it has been found in online breach data, they will be prompted to reset their password. This is useful for blocking passwords in the case that:\n\nThe password has recently been added to the compromised password database\nThe user was able to set a compromised password because protection was off at the time\nThe user was migrated to Clerk along with their existing password digest\n\nNote\n\nPassword reset for compromised passwords uses the same flow as \"forgot password\". The user will need to authenticate first via an OTP⁠ code sent to their email or phone and only then they will be able to set a new — more secure — password.\n\nTo configure this feature:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page.\nSelect the Password tab and on the right side, select Update password requirements. You can enable or disable Reject compromised passwords.\nPassword strength\n\nClerk uses zxcvbn-ts⁠ for estimating the strength of passwords and leverages the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) guidelines⁠ to determine its handling of password strength:\n\nNote\n\nOWASP recommends using a password strength estimation library like zxcvbn to evaluate the strength of passwords. This can help identify weak passwords and prevent their use.\n\nFor users that set an average/weak password that complies with your organization's policies but could be stronger - Clerk also provides a gentle recommendation to use a stronger password.\n\nNote\n\nOWASP recommends providing feedback to users on the strength of their password and offering suggestions for improvement. This can help users create stronger passwords and improve the overall security of the application.\n\nManually set a password as compromised\n\nWarning\n\nIf your instance is older than December 18, 2025, you will need to update your instance⁠ to the Reset password session task update.\n\nClerk provides a way to manually set a password as compromised. This is useful for blocking passwords in the case that:\n\nThe password has recently been added to the compromised password database.\nThe user was able to set a compromised password because protection was off at the time.\n\nTo manually set a user's password as compromised:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to Users⁠ page and select the user you want to mark as compromised. You'll be redirected to the user's settings.\nIn the Password section, if a password is set, select the three dots icon and select Set password as compromised. A modal will appear asking you to confirm the action. Complete the instructions.\n\nImportant\n\nSetting a user's password as compromised will prevent the user from signing in until they reset their password. If you are implementing custom authentication flows⁠, you will need to handle the compromised password flow by yourself. See the dedicated custom flow guide for more information.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This is in contrast to user authentication, which verifies the identity of a human user. Clerk currently supports three types of machine authentication tokens:\n\nOAuth access tokens\nM2M (machine-to-machine) tokens\nAPI keys\nOAuth access tokens\n\nOAuth⁠ is a widely adopted standard designed to provide a secure way for users to grant third-party applications limited access to their data and resources without providing their login credentials directly. While OAuth includes several different flows that serve different purposes, Clerk primarily supports the authorization code flow, which returns an OAuth access token⁠ that can be used by a machine to authenticate requests to Clerk's API on behalf of a user.\n\nTo learn more about machine authentication with OAuth access tokens, see the OAuth scoped access and OAuth token verification guides.\n\nIf you are looking for support for the OAuth client credentials flow⁠, Clerk does not yet support it, but we are aiming to add support for it in the near future. Add your feedback and get notified when it's available here⁠.\n\nM2M tokens\n\nIf your goal is to authenticate requests made between several different services within your own infrastructure, this is the intended use case for Clerk's M2M tokens feature. With this feature, you can create machines, dictate which machines are allowed to communicate with each other, and create tokens that can be used to authenticate requests between these machines.\n\nTo learn more about machine authentication with M2M tokens, see the M2M tokens guide.\n\nAPI keys\n\nIf you'd like for your application's users to be able to create API keys that can delegate access to your application's API on their behalf, this is the intended use case for Clerk's API keys feature.\n\nWith this feature, you will be able to allow users to create API keys directly through the \n<UserProfile />\n component, or create your own UI for API keys via custom hooks. It will also be simple to verify API keys on your backend using Clerk's SDKs, and you or your users will be able to instantly revoke API keys at any time.\n\nTo learn more about machine authentication with API keys, see the API keys guide.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

It is intended primarily as a method for authenticating requests between different backend services within your own infrastructure.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to create and configure machines, how to create m2m tokens, and how to use a token to authenticate a request.\n\nNote\n\nIf you find that the use case being described does not fit what you are looking to accomplish with machine authentication, check out the machine authentication overview for more information on the different types of machine authentication that Clerk supports and what features are available for each type.\n\nPricing\n\nBefore getting started, it's important to note that M2M tokens will be a paid feature. They are currently free to use while in beta, but will be charged based on usage after the beta period comes to an end. The pricing will be as follows:\n\n$0.001 per token creation.\n$0.00001 per token verification.\n\nThere will be usage stats and monitoring available in the Clerk Dashboard before the beta period comes to an end to make it easy to understand your usage and what you're being charged.\n\nThere will also be a feature that allows the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)⁠ instead of opaque tokens⁠ before the beta period comes to an end. While JWTs can't be instantly revoked, they don't require a network request for verification and incur charges only for creation, not verification.\n\nCreating machines\n\nClerk's M2M feature is designed to secure and facilitate communication between different machines within your backend infrastructure. To get started, head to the M2M authentication⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard, where you can create machines and configure their allowed communication partners.\n\nThis example creates two machines, Machine A and Machine B, and configures them to allow communication with each other.\n\nSelect Add machine to add a machine.\nUnder Name, enter your machine name (Machine A). Select Create.\nRepeat this process for another machine (Machine B), but this time, in the Scopes section, select Machine A to allow Machine B to communicate with Machine A.\nIn the list of machines, next to Machine A, select Edit machine.\nIn the Scopes section, select Machine B to allow Machine A to communicate with Machine B.\nSelect Update to save the changes.\n\nBoth machines are now configured to enable full bi-directional communication between them, allowing them to create tokens to authenticate requests in either direction.\n\nImportant\n\nWhen you modify machine scopes, the changes only apply to newly created M2M tokens. Any existing M2M tokens that were created before the scope modification will retain their original scopes and will not be affected by the changes.\n\nNow that you have your machines set up, the next step is to create tokens that will allow them to authenticate requests between each other.\n\nCreating M2M tokens\n\nBefore creating an M2M token, you need to ensure that you have set up your environment variables to include the machine secret key that was generated when configuring the machines in the Clerk Dashboard. This key can be viewed at any time by selecting the View machine secret option under the ... menu by any given machine in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nNote that each machine has a unique machine secret key, so you will need to set up environment variables for each machine, and ensure that the correct machine secret key is available for each machine.\n\n.env\nCLERK_MACHINE_SECRET_KEY = ak_xxx\n\nImportant\n\nLoading environment variables is different depending on the framework you are using. For example, Next.js requires the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for environment variables that are available on the frontend. In other frameworks, you can use a package like dotenv⁠. Check your framework's documentation for information on how to load environment variables.\n\nTo create an M2M token, call the createToken() method:\n\nconst m2mToken = await clerkClient.m2m.createToken()\nconsole.log(m2mToken)\n\nWhile it is strongly recommended to use environment variables for security, if you need to pass in the machine secret key directly rather than using an environment variable, you can do so by passing it as an argument to the createToken() method, as shown in the following example:\n\nconst m2mToken = await clerkClient.m2m.createToken({\n  machineSecretKey: 'ak_xxx',\n})\nconsole.log(m2mToken)\n\nThe method will return an object with the following properties:\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"mt_xxx\",\n  \"subject\": \"mch_xxx\",\n  \"scopes\": [\"mch_xxx\"],\n  \"claims\": null,\n  \"revoked\": false,\n  \"revocationReason\": null,\n  \"expired\": false,\n  \"expiration\": 1754942036732,\n  \"createdAt\": 1754938436732,\n  \"updatedAt\": 1754938436732,\n  \"token\": \"mt_xxx\"\n}\n\nThe token property contains the token that you will use to authenticate requests between machines. You can transmit this token however you wish, but it is common to use it as a bearer token in the Authorization header of your requests, as shown in the following example:\n\nawait fetch('<machine-b-url>', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    Authorization: `Bearer ${m2mToken.secret}`,\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from Machine A' }),\n})\n\nThere are two additional optional arguments that can be passed to the createToken() method:\n\nsecondsUntilExpiration - The number of seconds until the token will expire. By default, the token will not expire.\nclaims - A JavaScript object that can be used to store additional information about the token.\nVerifying M2M tokens\n\nImagine a request was made from Machine A to Machine B, and Machine B received it successfully. The next step is to verify that the token is valid and that the request is coming from a valid machine. To do so, you can use the verifyToken() method:\n\n// code for receiving the request and extracting the token from the\n// Authorization header...\n\nconst m2mToken = await clerkClient.m2m.verifyToken({ token })\n\nKeep in mind that this code would be running on Machine B. On Machine B, set process.env.CLERK_MACHINE_SECRET_KEY to the machine secret key for Machine B (or pass it directly with the machineSecretKey argument). The token parameter would be the token that was received from the request sent from Machine A.\n\nIf the token is valid, the method will return an object with the following properties:\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"mt_xxx\",\n  \"subject\": \"mch_xxx\",\n  \"scopes\": [\"mch_xxx\"],\n  \"claims\": null,\n  \"revoked\": false,\n  \"revocationReason\": null,\n  \"expired\": false,\n  \"expiration\": 1754943177115,\n  \"createdAt\": 1754939577115,\n  \"updatedAt\": 1754939577568,\n  \"token\": undefined\n}\n\nYou can then fulfill the request, or reject it if the token is invalid.\n\nRevoking M2M tokens\n\nTo revoke an M2M token, call the revokeToken() method:\n\nawait clerkClient.m2m.revokeToken({\n  m2mTokenId: m2mToken.id,\n  revocationReason: 'Just because 🤪', // optional, for your records\n})\n\nThis will revoke the token and prevent it from being used to authenticate any future requests.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Each format has trade-offs that make it better suited for different use cases.\n\nJWT tokens\n\nJSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are self-contained tokens that encode claims (such as user ID, scopes, and expiration) directly within the token. JWTs are signed using your instance's private key and can be verified using the corresponding public key.\n\nBenefits\nNetworkless verification: JWTs can be verified locally using your instance's public key, without making a network request to Clerk's servers.\nSelf-contained: All necessary information is embedded in the token itself.\nPerformance: Reduces latency by eliminating round-trip network requests for verification.\nLimitations\nCannot be instantly revoked: Once issued, a JWT remains valid until it expires. Revocation requires waiting for the token to expire or implementing additional revocation logic.\nOpaque tokens\n\nOpaque tokens are randomly generated strings that contain no embedded information. They must be verified by making a request to Clerk's servers, which looks up the token in a database, and is then able to retrieve associated information about the token.\n\nBenefits\nInstant revocation: Opaque tokens can be revoked immediately, making them ideal for security-sensitive applications where you need to invalidate access quickly.\nLimitations\nNetwork dependency: Every verification requires a network request to Clerk's servers.\nLatency: Verification is slower due to the network round-trip.\nCompatibility: There are certain third-party tools and libraries that only support JWT tokens.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The API may change before general availability.\n\nClerk's API keys feature allows your application's users to create API keys that can delegate access to your application's API on their behalf. API keys are typically long-lived tokens associated with a user or organization that provide access to a set of API endpoints for third-party services.\n\nFor example, imagine you're building an application like ChatGPT and you want developers on your platform to retrieve their recent conversations. You could let them generate API keys that are tied to their individual user accounts, giving them access only to their own chats. In this case, the API key would be scoped to a specific user. API keys can also be scoped to organizations or have granular scopes, such as allowing a key to read chats but not create new ones.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to create API keys, list them, use them to authenticate requests, and revoke them when needed.\n\nNote\n\nIf you find that the use case being described does not fit what you are looking to accomplish with machine authentication, check out the machine authentication overview for more information on the different types of machine authentication that Clerk supports and what features are available for each type.\n\nPricing\n\nBefore getting started, it's important to note that API keys will be a paid feature. They are currently free to use while in beta, but will be charged based on usage after the beta period comes to an end. The pricing will be as follows:\n\n$0.001 per key creation.\n$0.00001 per key verification.\n\nThere will be usage stats and monitoring available in the Clerk Dashboard before the beta period comes to an end to make it easy to understand your usage and what you're being charged.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore you can use API keys in your application, you must enable them in the Clerk Dashboard:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the API keys⁠ page.\nSelect Enable API keys.\nSelect the option that you need depending on your use case: Enable User API keys, Enable Organization API keys, or both.\nSelect Enable.\n\nNote\n\nIf the API keys feature is disabled in the Dashboard, any existing keys will fail verification but will not be revoked. If you re-enable the feature, those keys will work again. This is different from revoking individual keys, which permanently invalidates them.\n\nEnabling your users to create API keys via Clerk's UI components\n\nClerk provides UI components that you can drop into your application to support your users in generating and managing API keys. You can integrate these components into your application's interface, or create your own custom logic for API key management using JS Backend SDK methods.\n\nIf you're using Clerk's \n<UserProfile />\n or \n<OrganizationProfile />\n components and have enabled API keys in the Clerk Dashboard, an API Keys tab will automatically appear in those profile components. This tab will allow your users to create, view, and revoke API keys, without writing any additional custom code on your end.\n\nIf you'd prefer to hide the API Keys tab in the user or organization profile components, you can do so by passing a prop to the component, as such:\n\n<UserProfile apiKeysProps={{ hide: true }} />\n<OrganizationProfile apiKeysProps={{ hide: true }} />\n<UserButton userProfileProps={{ apiKeysProps: { hide: true } }} />\n\nIt's also possible to render the \n<APIKeys />\n component directly if you want to embed the API key management UI within your own application's interface.\n\nTip\n\nHiding the UI doesn't prevent users from creating API keys - they can still generate them through Clerk's Frontend API. If you want to ensure only backend-issued API keys are valid, include the scopes or claims parameters when creating your keys. Your verification logic can then reject any keys missing the required scopes or claims, making user-generated keys unusable.\n\nUsing API keys in requests\n\nOnce you have an API key, you can use it to authenticate requests to your application's API. The API key should be sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header:\n\nawait fetch('https://your-api.com/users', {\n  method: 'GET',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n  },\n})\n\nOn your backend, you can verify the API key using Clerk's SDKs. See the verifying API keys guide for framework-specific examples.\n\nUsing API keys via Clerk's SDKs\n\nIf you would like to create, list, and revoke API keys programmatically on the server side, you can use Clerk's Backend SDKs. This guide uses the \nJS Backend SDK\n to demonstrate usage, but please note that the API keys feature is available in all of Clerk's Backend SDKs.\n\nCreating API keys\n\nTo create an API key, call the create() method:\n\nconst apiKey = await clerkClient.apiKeys.create({\n  name: 'My API Key',\n  subject: 'user_xxx', // or 'org_xxx' for organization API keys\n  description: 'API key for accessing my application', // optional\n  scopes: ['read:users', 'write:users'], // optional\n  secondsUntilExpiration: 86400, // optional: expires in 24 hours\n})\n\nThe method returns an object containing the API key details, including the secret property with the actual API key value:\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"ak_xxx\",\n  \"name\": \"My API Key\",\n  \"description\": \"API key for accessing my application\",\n  \"subject\": \"user_xxx\",\n  \"scopes\": [\"read:users\", \"write:users\"],\n  \"claims\": null,\n  \"revoked\": false,\n  \"revocationReason\": null,\n  \"expired\": false,\n  \"expiration\": 1754942036732,\n  \"createdAt\": 1754938436732,\n  \"updatedAt\": 1754938436732,\n  \"createdBy\": \"user_xxx\",\n  \"secret\": \"ak_xxx\"\n}\n\nWarning\n\nThe API key secret is only available in the initial response from create() and cannot be retrieved again. Make sure to store the secret securely immediately after creation. If you lose the secret, you will need to create a new API key.\n\nRequired parameters\nname - A descriptive name for the API key (e.g., \"Production API Key\", \"Development Key\").\nsubject - The user ID (user_xxx) or organization ID (org_xxx) to associate the API key with.\nOptional parameters\ndescription - A longer description of what the API key is used for.\nscopes - An array of scope strings that define what the API key can access.\nclaims - A JavaScript object that can be used to store additional information about the API key.\ncreatedBy - The user ID of the user creating the API key (for audit purposes).\nsecondsUntilExpiration - The number of seconds until the API key expires. By default, API keys never expire. They are typically long-lived tokens since automatic expiration could cause third-party services using them to break unexpectedly. Instead, API keys can be instantly revoked if there is a security issue - this is possible because they are opaque tokens⁠ rather than JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)⁠.\nListing API keys\n\nTo list API keys, call the list() method:\n\nconst apiKeys = await clerkClient.apiKeys.list({\n  subject: 'user_xxx', // Filter by user or organization ID\n  includeInvalid: false, // Whether to include revoked or expired keys\n})\n\nThe method returns a paginated response with API key objects (without secrets):\n\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"ak_xxx\",\n      \"name\": \"My API Key\",\n      \"description\": \"API key for accessing my application\",\n      \"subject\": \"user_xxx\",\n      \"scopes\": [\"read:users\"],\n      \"revoked\": false,\n      \"expired\": false,\n      \"expiration\": 1754942036732,\n      \"createdAt\": 1754938436732,\n      \"updatedAt\": 1754938436732\n    }\n  ],\n  \"totalCount\": 1\n}\nVerifying API keys\n\nTo verify an API key secret, call the verify() method:\n\nconst apiKey = await clerkClient.apiKeys.verify(secret)\n\nIf the API key is valid, the method will return the API key object with its properties. If the API key is invalid, revoked, or expired, the method will throw an error.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to handle verification errors:\n\nimport { isClerkAPIResponseError } from '@clerk/shared/error'\n\ntry {\n  const apiKey = await clerkClient.apiKeys.verify(secret)\n  // API key is valid, proceed with the request\n} catch (error) {\n  if (isClerkAPIResponseError(error)) {\n    console.error(error.errors[0]?.message)\n  }\n  throw error\n}\n\nNote\n\nIn most cases, you'll want to verify API keys using framework-specific helpers like auth() in Next.js, which handles the verification automatically. See the verifying API keys guide for more details.\n\nRevoking API keys\n\nImportant\n\nWhen you revoke an API key, it is immediately invalidated. Any requests using that API key will be rejected. Make sure to notify users or update your systems before revoking API keys that are in active use.\n\nTo revoke an API key, call the revoke() method:\n\nawait clerkClient.apiKeys.revoke({\n  apiKeyId: apiKey.id,\n  revocationReason: 'Key compromised', // optional, for your records\n})\n\nThis will revoke the API key and prevent it from being used to authenticate any future requests. The API key will remain in your list but will be marked as revoked.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The CAPTCHA widget will only be shown if the client is suspected to be a bot.\n\nWarning\n\nIf your application previously had the Invisible CAPTCHA type selected, it's highly recommended to switch to the Smart option, as the Invisible option is deprecated. For newer applications, CAPTCHA type options are no longer shown in the Dashboard. Bot protection uses the Smart option by default and is enabled by turning on the Bot sign-up protection toggle only.\n\nLimitations\nClerk uses Cloudflare⁠ for bot detection, which isn't supported in non-browser environments (e.g. Expo, Chrome Extension). If you're using any of these SDKs, disable bot protection from the Clerk Dashboard.\nIf you're building a custom sign-up flow using the Clerk API instead of using Clerk components, and you have enabled Bot sign-up protection, then you need to ensure you have added a DOM node to render the CAPTCHA widget.

The user must enter this code to complete the sign-in process.\n\nNote\n\nIf the user has already enabled MFA (such as an authenticator app or SMS verification), Client Trust will not trigger - their existing MFA method will be used instead.\n\nEnable Client Trust\n\nClient Trust is automatically enabled for Clerk applications created after November 14, 2025. For applications created before this date, you can enable Client Trust in the Clerk Dashboard:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Updates⁠ page.\nEnable the Client Trust update.\nHow Client Trust differs from traditional MFA\nAspect\tClient Trust\tTraditional MFA\nTrigger\tAutomatic on new devices\tUser must enable it\nVerification method\tEmail/phone code\tTOTP, SMS code, backup codes\nUser setup required\tNone\tUser must configure their preferred method\nWhen it applies\tOnly for password sign-ins\tAll sign-ins\nImpact on custom sign-in flows\n\nIf you've built a custom sign-in flow⁠ that allows password-based sign-ins using the Clerk API or SDKs, you'll need to handle the needs_second_factor status that Client Trust can trigger.\n\nWhen Client Trust requires verification, the sign-in attempt will return a status of needs_second_factor with email_code in the supportedSecondFactors array. Your flow should:\n\nCheck if the sign-in status is needs_second_factor.\nCheck if email_code is in the supportedSecondFactors array.\nCall prepareSecondFactor() to send the verification code to the user's email address or phone number.\nCollect the code from the user.\nCall attemptSecondFactor() to verify the code.\nIf successful, set the session as active.\n\nFor a complete implementation example, see the email/password custom flow guide.\n\nTip\n\nIf your application supports both Client Trust and user-enabled MFA, make sure to check for all possible second factor⁠ strategies when handling the needs_second_factor status.\n\nLimitations\nPassword-only: Client Trust only applies to password-based sign-ins. Passwordless authentication methods (such as email links, OTPs⁠, passkeys, and OAuth) are not affected.\nEmail/Phone number required: Client Trust requires the user to have a verified email address or phone number to receive the verification code.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

One method is a \"brute force\" attack, where a script will attempt many different passwords to sign into an account. One line of defense against these attacks is to temporarily deny attempts to sign into accounts that attempt too many failed sign-ins in a short period of time. Locking out sign-in attempts disrupts the attack and makes the account a less attractive target.\n\nHow Clerk protects against brute force attacks\n\nAccount lockout is a Clerk feature that enables you to protect your users from brute-force attacks on static credentials. If enabled on your instance, Clerk will automatically track users' failed verification attempts when they try to authenticate via password on backup code.\n\nHow account lockout works\n\nBy default, Clerk applications will lock user accounts after 100 failed sign-in attempts and require a one hour cool down period before anyone can attempt to sign into that account again. (While 100 attempts may seem like a lot to a human, it is very easy to reach this maximum for a bot!)\n\nIf the maximum allowed attempts are reached, the user will be locked out from signing in again until the lockout duration lapses. Lockout can also be configured to never expire, in which case the user will not be able to sign in unless an admin unlocks them.\n\nAn admin can unlock a user before the expiry of the lockout period via the Clerk Dashboard or programmatically.\n\nClerk measures the following actions as part of account lockout:\n\nPassword attempts\nPassword resets\nBackup code requests\nEmail & Phone codes\nTOTP attempts\nWhat a locked out user sees\n\nWhen a user exceeds the maximum sign-in attempts, the Clerk \n<SignIn />\n component will inform them of how long they have been locked out for and to contact support for more information.\n\nNote\n\nCurrently, users cannot unlock their own account or submit a request to the admin to be unlocked (\"self-service unlock\"). This is an upcoming feature, so see the changelog⁠ periodically to find out when it is available. Until then, you can lock and unlock user accounts programmatically.\n\nCustomize max sign-in attempts and lockout duration\n\nYou can customize the number of times a sign-in can be attempted before the account is locked, and how long lockouts last. To configure this feature, in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Attack protection⁠ page. Here, you can enable or disable Account lockout, or configure the following settings:\n\nThe Maximum attempt limit setting controls the number of failed sign-in attempts before a user is locked out. To change this setting, enter a new number of failed attempts allowed. (The default is 100 attempts.)\nLockout duration controls the amount of time a user is locked out from their account after reaching the Maximum attempt limit.\nThe Time limit setting allows you to set an amount of time until the user account is unlocked. To change this setting, select the unit of time (minutes/hours/days/years) and enter the number of units you want lockouts to last.\nThe Indefinite Lockout setting locks a user account until it's manually unlocked in the Clerk Dashboard.\nUnlock user accounts\n\nThere are two ways to unlock a user's account:\n\nThrough the Clerk Dashboard\nProgrammatically\nUnlock a user through the Clerk Dashboard\n\nUsers with admin roles can override lockouts through the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nIn the top in the Clerk Dashboard, select Users⁠.\nLocate the locked user by looking for a \"locked\" badge next to their username/email.\nOn the right of that user's row, open the menu by selecting the three dots icon.\nSelect Unlock to unlock the user account.\n\nAlternatively, you can unlock a user's account on their profile page.\n\nIn the top in the Clerk Dashboard, select Users⁠.\nLocate the locked user by looking for a \"locked\" badge next to their username/email.\nSelect the user's row to be taken to their profile page.\nScroll to the Unlock user section, and select Unlock user.\nUnlock a user programmatically\n\nYou can programmatically unlock a user using the UnlockUser⁠ Backend API endpoint.\n\nUse cases\nDisplay an unlock button\n\nYour custom sign-in page could expose a button or link that allows the user to request an unlock token when they are locked out of their account.\n\nYour app should be able to generate a random unlock token and associate it with the user.\nThe unlock token can be sent to the user via email or SMS.\nAfter successful entry of the unlock token, your app's backend can issue an unlock request to the Clerk Backend API.\nSend an unlock request to an admin\n\nIf your app supports users submitting admin requests, it could expose a way of requesting an admin unlock.\n\nA request for unlock could arrive in your app's admin dashboard.\nIf an admin reviews the request and decides to grant access back to the user, they can request an unlock from your app's backend, which should in turn call the Clerk Backend API.\nLock a user programmatically\n\nIf you'd like to manually lock a user from signing in, you can use the LockUser⁠ Backend API endpoint. Keep in mind that Clerk will still lock the user based on failed verification attempts.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

XSS vulnerabilities are incredibly serious and we recommend you reference the OWASP® Foundation's Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Cheat Sheet⁠ to learn how you can prevent an attack.\n\nPrevention is just one aspect of an effective security model. To prepare for the worst case scenario where an attack is successful, you should ensure your application is configured to minimize the attack's surface area.\n\nClerk works to minimize the surface area by using HttpOnly cookies for authenticated requests to our Frontend API⁠, so that credentials cannot be leaked during XSS attacks.\n\nWhat is a HttpOnly cookie?\n\nHttpOnly is a flag on the Set-Cookie⁠ header that is issued by a server to set a cookie in the browser.\n\nBy default, cookies can be accessed via document.cookie in JavaScript. When the HttpOnly flag is set on a cookie, the cookie is only accessible server-side through HTTP requests. The cookie cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript code, including attempts to read it via document.cookie. This provides an important security boundary between client and server-side cookie access.\n\nHow do HttpOnly cookies minimize XSS attacks?\n\nDuring an XSS attack, malicious JavaScript can execute in users' browsers. If session tokens are stored in JavaScript-accessible locations like localStorage or non-HttpOnly cookies, the attacker can steal these tokens and impersonate users even after the XSS vulnerability is fixed. If this happens, it is recommended you invalidate existing tokens and force users to sign in again.\n\nBy using HttpOnly cookies, Clerk ensures session tokens cannot be accessed by JavaScript, protecting them from XSS attacks.\n\nFor maximum security, avoid storing session tokens in JavaScript-accessible locations like:\n\nCookies without the HttpOnly flag\nWindow.localStorage⁠\nWindow.sessionStorage⁠\nIndexedDB⁠\nWhy is the __session cookie on my application domain not HttpOnly?\n\nThe __session cookie contains the session token and it is dropped by Clerk to your application's root domain (e.g. example.com). It is not HttpOnly because it needs to be accessible by Clerk's client-side SDKs. However, for this reason, the token contained in this cookie is short-lived (1 minute lifetime), so as to mitigate any potential XSS attacks. Read more about the __session and __client cookies in the guide on how Clerk works.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The attack inherits the victim's identity and privileges to perform an undesired action on the their behalf. For most sites, browser requests automatically include credentials associated with the site, such as the user's session cookie, IP address, Windows domain credentials, and more. Therefore, if the user is currently authenticated, the site cannot distinguish between a forged request initiated by the attacker and a legitimate request from the user.\n\nThe OWASP® Foundation, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)⁠\n\nMost CSRF attacks can be protected against by properly configuring the way session tokens are stored. Clerk handles the necessary configuration on your behalf by configuring cookies with the SameSite flag.\n\nWhat does a CSRF attack look like?\n\nImagine an attacker made a malicious website at foo.com that contained the following code:\n\n<img src=\"https://www.example.com/?action=delete&id=123\" />\n\nNotice the query string ?action=delete&id=123.\n\nIf a user signed in to example.com loads this page, and example.com is configured to execute actions from the query string for authorized users, an attacker could potentially delete the user's account on example.com without their knowledge. The user would simply see a webpage with a broken image, which could be easily hidden using CSS.\n\nHow does SameSite help prevent CSRF attacks?\n\nFortunately, the SameSite flag⁠, which can be added to the Set-Cookie header, can prevent CSRF attacks. In the previous example, if the developers of example.com set the SameSite flag on their session cookies to Strict or Lax, the browser would not send the cookie with requests to foo.com. Therefore, the attack would fail as the user would not be authenticated and the backend would presumably block the delete action.\n\nLet's break down what each of the values of SameSite do:\n\nStrict: The cookie will only be sent with HTTP requests initiated from the same site. While this may seem like the most secure option, it results in users being signed out if they navigate to the site from an external link. Since the cookie is omitted in cross-site requests, this leads to a poor user experience and is generally not recommended when using cookies for authentication.\nLax: The cookie will be sent with HTTP requests initiated from the same site, and with direct navigations from a cross-site origin, but not with requests to load resources such as images or frames. This setting still protects against CSRF attacks without the poor user experience issues of Strict, where users are signed out when navigating from external links. Lax is the default setting in modern browsers and is recommended for most use cases.\nNone: The browser will send cookies for both same-site and cross-site requests. While this setting allows for more flexibility in certain scenarios, it also increases the risk of CSRF attacks and therefore is not recommended.\n\nClerk sets the SameSite flag for all of its session cookies to Lax, which is the default in modern browsers.\n\nDo I need to take additional steps to prevent CSRF attacks?\n\nYou do not, but it is still possible to accidentally make your application vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n\nBecause Clerk uses the Lax setting, it is critical to remember that navigation alone should never trigger a mutation in your backend. Otherwise, the user can be tricked into clicking a link that takes an action they did not intend.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This vulnerability arises when web applications reuse existing session IDs instead of generating new ones during the authentication process. By exploiting this flaw, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to a user's account and perform malicious actions on their behalf.\n\nSee the OWASP Session Fixation⁠ page for specific examples of how this attack works.\n\nHow does Clerk protect against session fixation?\n\nClerk resets the session token each time a user signs in or out of a browser.

This protects your apps from XSS attacks and data injections.\n\nFor Clerk to work correctly in your application, the following CSP directives are required:\n\nscript-src - This value should include the host application's FAPI hostname, such as https://clerk.your-domain.com, as well as cloudflare's bot protection host, https://challenges.cloudflare.com.\nconnect-src - This value should include the host application's FAPI hostname, such as https://clerk.your-domain.com.\nimg-src - This value should be https://img.clerk.com.\nworker-src - Use the 'self' value to indicate that workers can be loaded from first-party scripts. The blob: schema value also needs to be included.\nstyle-src - This value should include 'unsafe-inline' due to Clerk's usage of runtime CSS-in-JS for styling.\nframe-src - This value should include cloudflare's bot protection host, https://challenges.cloudflare.com.\n\nThere are two ways to configure your CSP headers:\n\nAutomatic CSP configuration - This is available for the Next.js SDK only. Clerk provides built-in support for automatically injecting CSP headers through middleware. This simplifies the process of setting up a secure CSP that works correctly with Clerk.\nManual CSP configuration\nAutomatic CSP configuration\n\nWarning\n\nAutomatic CSP configuration is available only for @clerk/nextjs >=6.14.0.\n\nClerk provides built-in support for automatically injecting CSP headers by adding the contentSecurityPolicy option to your clerkMiddleware(). There are two modes available depending on how strict you want your CSP to be:\n\ndefault configuration\nstrict configuration\ndefault configuration\n\nThe default configuration will apply the following CSP directives:\n\nconnect-src - 'self' https://clerk-telemetry.com https://*.clerk-telemetry.com https://api.stripe.com https://maps.googleapis.com https://{{fapi_url}}\ndefault-src - 'self'\nform-action - 'self'\nframe-src - 'self' https://challenges.cloudflare.com https://*.js.stripe.com https://js.stripe.com https://hooks.stripe.com\nimg-src - 'self' https://img.clerk.com\nscript-src - 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https http https://*.js.stripe.com https://js.stripe.com https://maps.googleapis.com\nstyle-src - 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\nworker-src - 'self' blob:\nproxy.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nconst isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'])\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware(\n  async (auth, request) => {\n    if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {\n      await auth.protect()\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    contentSecurityPolicy: {},\n  },\n)\nstrict configuration\n\nWhen using the strict configuration, Clerk will:\n\nAutomatically generate a unique nonce for each request.\nConfigure the CSP header with appropriate directives.\nMake the nonce available to your application through the x-nonce header.\n\nThe middleware will handle passing the nonce to the <ClerkProvider> automatically, so you don't need to manually set the nonce prop when using server components.\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nconst isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'])\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware(\n  async (auth, request) => {\n    if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {\n      await auth.protect()\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    contentSecurityPolicy: {\n      strict: true,\n    },\n  },\n)\n\nImportant\n\nYou must pass the \ndynamic prop\n to <ClerkProvider> for strict CSP configuration to work correctly. This is because the nonce value is generated on the server and passed to the client, which requires dynamic rendering.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    // When using clerkMiddleware with `strict` configuration,\n    // the nonce is automatically provided.\n    // No need to manually set the `nonce` prop on `<ClerkProvider>`\n    <ClerkProvider dynamic>\n      <html lang=\"en\">\n        <body>{children}</body>\n      </html>\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nIf you need to apply the nonce to custom scripts, you can access it through the headers:\n\npages/index.tsx\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const nonce = headers().get('x-nonce')\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <script nonce={nonce} src=\"/custom-script.js\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nAdd additional CSP directives\n\nYou can customize your Content Security Policy (CSP) by adding your own directives to either the default or strict configurations. Simply provide a directives object, and your custom rules will be merged with Clerk's default security settings.\n\nIn the following example, the connect-src directive is configured to include api.example.com and analytics.example.com, and the img-src directive is configured to include images.example.com.\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nconst isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'])\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware(\n  async (auth, request) => {\n    if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {\n      await auth.protect()\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    contentSecurityPolicy: {\n      strict: true,\n      directives: {\n        'connect-src': ['api.example.com', 'analytics.example.com'],\n        'img-src': ['images.example.com'],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n)\nManual CSP configuration\n\nThe following example demonstrates a Next.js config file that sets the necessary directives for your application's assets and Clerk to load and function correctly. The values used in the example are generated from your currently selected instance in the Clerk Dashboard. Make sure to handle both your development instance and production instance hosts.\n\nWarning\n\nYou will need to make sure any third-party domains where scripts or assets are loaded from are also specified.\n\nnext.config.js\nconst cspHeader = `\n  default-src 'self';\n  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL https://challenges.cloudflare.com;\n  connect-src 'self' https://YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL;\n  img-src 'self' https://img.clerk.com;\n  worker-src 'self' blob:;\n  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';\n  frame-src 'self' https://challenges.cloudflare.com;\n  form-action 'self';\n`\n\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/(.*)',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',\n            value: cspHeader.replace(/\\n/g, ''),\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\nUsage of unsafe-eval and unsafe-inline directives in Next.js\n\nNext.js and Clerk have specific requirements for script-src and style-src directives. Here's what you need to know:\n\nscript-src 'unsafe-eval' is a requirement for Next.js⁠ to run in development environments. For production environment CSPs, it should be removed.\nscript-src 'unsafe-inline' depends on your Next.js routing structure.\nApp Router: Required in both development and production environments, unless you are using the strict-dynamic approach.\nPages Router: Can be safely removed.\nstyle-src 'unsafe-inline' is a requirement for Clerk's components to inject their styles. Removing this requirement is on Clerk's roadmap. If you'd like to see this implemented sooner, contact support⁠.\nImplementing a strict-dynamic CSP\n\nIf you'd like to manually implement a strict-dynamic CSP⁠, Clerk supports this, but with a different type of configuration. As strict-dynamic CSPs require a \"nonce\" value that should be programmatically generated per-request, the best way to make this work is within middleware that runs on every request. The following example demonstrates how to implement a strict-dynamic CSP with Next.js middleware, but the same approach could be used with any other framework.\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {\n  return applyCsp(req)\n})\n\nfunction applyCsp(req) {\n  // create a randomly generated nonce value\n  const nonce = Buffer.from(crypto.randomUUID()).toString('base64')\n\n  // format the CSP header\n  const cspHeader = `\n    default-src 'self';\n    script-src 'self' 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-${nonce}' https: http: ${\n      process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '' : `'unsafe-eval'`\n    };\n    connect-src 'self' https://YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL;\n    img-src 'self' https://img.clerk.com;\n    worker-src 'self' blob:;\n    style-src 'self';\n    frame-src 'self' https://challenges.cloudflare.com;\n    form-action 'self';\n  `\n  // Replace newline characters and spaces\n  const contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue = cspHeader.replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ').trim()\n\n  // set the nonce and csp values in the request headers\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(req.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-nonce', nonce)\n  requestHeaders.set('Content-Security-Policy', contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue)\n\n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n\n  response.headers.set('Content-Security-Policy', contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue)\n\n  return response\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params\n    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',\n    // Always run for API routes\n    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',\n  ],\n}\n\nWith this strict-dynamic configuration in place, all script tags must be passed with a nonce value or they will be blocked. This can be done by passing the nonce value as a nonce parameter to the script tag. For example, <script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" nonce=\"<nonce_value>\"></script>. If you are using Next.js, any scripts loaded through next will automatically have the nonce value injected.\n\nWith the above middleware, the nonce value is made accessible via the x-nonce request header. An example is provided below on how to access this value within a Next.js page.\n\npages/index.tsx\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const nonce = headers().get('x-nonce')\n\n  return <p>{nonce}</p>\n}\n\nIf you're using one of Clerk's React-based SDKs, in order for Clerk to load correctly, the nonce value must also be passed to the <ClerkProvider> component. This can be done by passing the nonce value as a nonce prop to the <ClerkProvider> component. For example:\n\nImportant\n\nYou must pass the \ndynamic prop\n to <ClerkProvider> for strict-dynamic CSPs to work correctly. This is because the nonce value is generated on the server and passed to the client, which requires dynamic rendering.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    // Note: since this is server-rendered, you don't _need_ to pass the nonce, see note below\n    <ClerkProvider nonce={headers().get('x-nonce')} dynamic>\n      <html lang=\"en\">\n        <body>{children}</body>\n      </html>\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nIf you are using Next.js and your layout file is rendered on the server (as is the case with the example above), Clerk's SDK will automatically read the nonce from the request and pass it into <ClerkProvider>. If you are rendering the provider on the client, you will need to explicitly pass the nonce value to the client and into <ClerkProvider>.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

When this setting is enabled, only email links opened on the same device and browser that a sign-in or sign-up was initiated on will successfully authenticate the user.\n\nEnabling this protection means that the following scenario cannot happen:\n\nA malicious actor knows the email of a user and requests an email link to sign-in or sign-up.\nThe user opens the email and visits the link, or the user's email provider follows links in emails for phishing or spam protection.\nThe malicious actor is able to gain access to the user's account because the email link has been opened successfully.\n\nDisabling this protection means that your users are vulnerable to the scenario above, but they will be able to sign-in or sign-up with email link across devices and browsers. For example, initiating an email link sign in on a laptop and then opening the email link on a phone to sign in successfully.\n\nWith same device and browser protection on, users will see the following warning if an email link for sign-in or sign-up was opened on a different device or browser:\n\nTo configure this security setting, navigate to the User & authentication⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard and ensure that under the Sign-in with email section, the Email verification link option is enabled.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This security feature helps identify potentially malicious sign-in activity.\n\nEmail notification for unauthorized access\n\nWhen a sign-in attempt is made from an unfamiliar device, Clerk notifies the account owner by email with details about the newly created session. The email notification varies depending on the instance's configuration and the application's billing plan.\n\nBy default, the email includes information about the unauthorized sign-in attempt, such as device type, operating system, IP address, location, and the sign-in method used. If you've set a support email for your app, Clerk will add instructions for the user to contact the app administrator.\n\nFor supported instances, the email might also include a button that allows users to sign out from the unrecognized device. Selecting this button immediately revokes the session.\n\nTo customize the unauthorized sign-in email notification:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Emails⁠ page.\nSelect Sign in from new device. You'll be redirected to the template settings page.\nEdit the email template.\nSelect Apply changes.\nRevoke sessions for unauthorized sign-ins\n\nWarning\n\nThis feature requires a paid plan⁠ for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the pricing⁠ page for more information.\n\nFor apps that support this feature, users can immediately revoke unauthorized sign-ins directly from the email notification. With a single click, the suspicious session is revoked and the user is redirected to a confirmation page.\n\nThe confirmation page depends on the instance configuration:\n\nAccount Portal enabled: The user is redirected to the unauthorized sign-in page, where content can be customized based on the app's theme.\nAccount Portal disabled: The user sees a plain text confirmation of the successful session revocation.\n\nIn either case, after revoking the session, users must sign in again unless they have an active session on their device.\n\nTo customize the URL path of the unauthorized sign-in page:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Paths⁠ page.\nUnder Application paths, enter the Unauthorized sign in URL path.\nSelect Save.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Whether you're using AI-powered development tools to build applications with Clerk, or building a Model Context Protocol (MCP)⁠ server that allows AI agents to access user data, these guides cover everything you need to get started.\n\nSkills\n\nClerk Skills are installable packages that give AI coding agents specialized knowledge about Clerk. Once installed, agents can help you add authentication, manage organizations, sync users, and more.\n\nnpx skills add clerk/skills\n\nWorks with most agents including Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI, and more. See the dedicated guide for available Skills and installation options.\n\nUse Clerk's MCP server\n\nClerk provides its own MCP server that helps AI coding agents provide accurate SDK snippets and implementation patterns. This is useful when building authentication features with Clerk in AI tools. Learn how to connect to Clerk's MCP server.\n\nBuild your own MCP implementation\n\nAn MCP implementation involves two parties: a \"client\" and a \"server\". In web development, the terms \"client\" and \"server\" often refer to the frontend (browser) and backend (web server). However, in the context of MCP, these terms have different meanings:\n\nThe \"client\" is the LLM application that wants to access another service on a user's behalf. For example, Claude would be the \"client\" if it wants to get access to Gmail.\nThe \"server\" is the system that hosts the protected resources the client wants to access. In this example, this would be Gmail. This is sometimes referred to as the \"resource server\" or \"MCP server\".\n\nClerk supports MCP through dynamic client registration (for registering MCP servers programmatically), consent screens (for secure user authorization), and SDK support, making it an ideal authorization server for MCP implementations.\n\nTo learn how to implement both sides of the flow using Clerk, refer to the following guides:\n\nBuild an MCP server\nConnect an MCP client\nAI prompts\n\nClerk's AI prompt library provides curated prompts to help you work more efficiently with AI-powered development tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and more. These prompts guide AI assistants in helping you implement Clerk's features correctly.\n\nTo learn more, see the \nAI prompts\n guide.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

It assumes that you have already built an MCP server in your application with Clerk by following the guide on \nbuilding an MCP server\n.\n\nConnect your client LLM to your MCP server\n\nTo complete the integration, you'll need to connect an MCP-compatible client to your MCP server. Each client has a different way of connecting to MCP servers, and given that the MCP spec is still in development, you may need to refer to the client's documentation for the most up-to-date instructions.\n\nImportant\n\nFor most client implementations of MCP, dynamic client registration⁠ is required. This allows MCP-compatible clients to automatically register themselves with your server during the OAuth flow. Before proceeding, ensure you have toggled on the Dynamic client registration option in the OAuth applications⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nDevelopment vs. Production Setup\nDevelopment: Start your MCP server by running npm run dev and use http://localhost:3000/mcp as your server URL.\nProduction: Use your deployed URL (e.g. https://your-domain.com/mcp) for security and proper functionality.\n\nWarning\n\nAlways use HTTPS URLs in production environments. HTTP connections are not secure and may not work with all MCP clients.\n\nCursor\nVSCode\nClaude Code\nClaude Desktop\nWindsurf\nConnecting Cursor to your MCP server\nNavigate to Cursor Settings. To find this, open the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P) and search for Cursor Settings, or select the gear icon in the top right corner of the app.\nIn the sidenav, select Tools & MCP. If you don't see this, you may need to update Cursor to the latest version.\nSelect the New MCP Server option, which will open up a new tab with the MCP configuration JSON file.\nAdd the following configuration to the JSON file:\n{ \"mcpServers\": { \"clerk-mcp-server\": { \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000/mcp\" } } }\n\nImportant\n\nReplace http://localhost:3000/mcp with your production URL if you've deployed your MCP server.\n\nSelect the Needs login option when it loads. You'll be redirected to a Clerk OAuth consent screen to authorize Cursor to access your user data.\nSelect Allow. Once authorized, your tool(s) should be listed as enabled and you should see a green active status.\nStart a new chat in Agent Mode⁠ and prompt it to fetch your Clerk user data (e.g., \"What is my Clerk user data?\").\nSelect the Run tool option once it becomes available.\n\nYou've now successfully connected Cursor to your MCP server and authenticated it using Clerk.\n\nExpected Response Format\n\nWhen you successfully connect and authenticate your MCP client, prompting for your Clerk user data should return information similar to:\n\nUser ID: <user-id>\nUsername: <username>\nFirst Name: <first-name>\nLast Name: <last-name>\nPrimary Email: <primary-email>\nSecondary Email: <secondary-email>\n2FA Enabled: No\nAccount Banned: No\nAccount Locked: No\nProfile Image: <profile-image>\nExternal Accounts: <external-account>\nOrganization Creation Enabled: Yes\nDelete Self Enabled: Yes\n\nThe exact response will vary based on your specific Clerk user profile and the prompt you use with your LLM client.\n\nNot Currently Supported\n\nThe MCP protocol and spec are still in development, and as a result, implementation across clients can vary. While we are working to support all clients, there are some clients that are not currently supported:\n\nCline: While it does have MCP support, their implementation is not compatible with the latest MCP spec.\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues connecting your MCP client:\n\nAuthentication fails: Ensure Dynamic client registration is enabled in the OAuth applications⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\nConnection refused: Verify your MCP server is running and accessible at the specified URL.\nHTTPS errors: Make sure you're using HTTPS URLs in production environments.\nTool not available: Confirm your client displays the tool in the list of available tools, and that the tool has been properly implemented.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

These instances vary slightly and should only be used appropriately.\n\nDevelopment instance\n\nA Development instance is Clerk's default instance type and has characteristics that allow it to be more useful for local development. To facilitate development and local authentication, Development instances have a more relaxed security posture and are not suitable for production workloads.\n\nSome notable examples of Development-only characteristics in a Clerk application are:\n\nA Development banner is shown prominently in the Clerk Dashboard to make clear you're managing or configuring non-production data.\nEmail and SMS templates are prefixed with the environment type to prevent against using Development instances for production purposes.\nSome social connections use shared credentials by default.\nThe Account Portal will use a Clerk development domain that ends with accounts.dev instead of your app's production domain.\nOAuth consent screens will show the development domain that ends with accounts.dev instead of your production domain.\nSearch engines will not be able to crawl and index your application.\nDevelopment instances are capped at 500 users, and user data can not be transferred between instances.\nThe architecture of Clerk's sessions management is different in development environments compared to production environments, due to the need to communicate cross-domain between localhost and <slug>.accounts.dev. The __clerk_db_jwt object is only used in development environments. For more specific details on the differences between Clerk's session management architecture in development and production environments, see the technical breakdown below.\n\nNote\n\nAll paid functionality is available in a Development instance. However, when you deploy your application to Production, you will be asked to upgrade to a Pro account if you are using paid features. See our pricing page for full details.\n\nProduction instance\n\nA Production instance is the more robust option of Clerk's instance types. Production instances are meant to support high volumes of traffic and by default, have a more strict security posture.\n\nSome notable differences between Production and Development instances in a Clerk application are:\n\nYou must associate a production domain within the Clerk Dashboard\nYou are required to provision your own SSO credentials\n\nWhen deploying to production, you must first activate your Production environment. See the Deploying to Production guide to learn about the process and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nStaging environments\n\nStaging environments enable you to internally test and demo changes to your application or website before deploying them to production. Currently, Clerk only offers Development and Production instances. Official support for Staging instances is still on the roadmap⁠. However, you can set up a \"staging environment\" by creating a separate Clerk application with a separate domain.\n\nCreating a separate Clerk application will prevent you from using live production environment data in your staging environment.\n\nImportant\n\nWhen you use a separate Clerk application for your staging environment, changes to this application will not be automatically mirrored in your main application for your production environment. You must manually make these changes yourself if you want them to be reflected in both applications.\n\nSet up a staging Clerk application\n\nThe following steps will help you set up a new Clerk application with a staging-specific domain:\n\nSet up a subdomain - This will be your staging domain. For example, if your domain is my-site.com, you could use staging.my-site.com.\nCreate a new Clerk app - Your staging environment will connect to this app instead of your main one. See the Clerk quickstart guide to learn how to create a Clerk app.\nDeploy and configure your staging app's production instance - Using production API keys will make your staging app more secure. Follow the Deploy to production guide to do so.\nAlternatives\nPreview environments\n\nWhile staging environments are typically long-lived, preview environments are typically generated on-demand for specific pull requests. See the section on using Clerk in a preview environment to learn about your options.\n\nShared production credentials\n\nIf you would like to share settings and data between your production and staging environments, see the dedicated guide. This is not recommended because you will be sharing a user table between your production and staging environments.\n\nPreview environments\n\nSome popular hosting providers like Vercel and Netlify offer preview deployments, which enable you to view changes to your site in a live environment before merging and deploying them to production.\n\nThere are two high-level approaches to using Clerk in a preview environment:\n\nSharing production settings and user data\nUsing independent settings and user data\nSharing production settings and user data\n\nTo share production settings and user data with your preview environment, your preview environment must be hosted on the same root domain (but a separate subdomain) as your production application. The preview environment must also be configured to use the same API keys as your production environment.\n\nGenerally, hosts have a special feature to host the preview environment on a subdomain of your root domain, for example:\n\nVercel: use the Preview Deployment Suffix⁠ feature. This feature is only available on Vercel's Pro and Enterprise plans.\nNetlify: use the Automatic Deploy Subdomain⁠ feature.\nUsing independent settings and user data\n\nThere are two approaches to creating a preview environment with independent settings and user data:\n\nEasiest: Use your host's provided preview domain, like *.vercel.app or *.netlify.app, with development API keys from Clerk.\nAcquire an additional root domain for your preview environment, completely separate from your production application's root domain.\nUse your host's provided preview domain\n\nConfigure the preview environment to use development API keys from Clerk. It is currently not possible to use Clerk production API keys with your host's provided preview domain.\n\nAcquire an additional root domain\n\nWarning\n\nTo use an independent environment, it is critical that you acquire an additional domain. An independent environment will not work if it is configured on the same domain as your production application, even if it is on a separate subdomain.\n\nTo use an additional root domain, you must first configure your host to deploy preview environments to that domain:\n\nVercel: use the Preview Deployment Suffix⁠ feature. This feature is only available on Vercel's Pro and Enterprise plans.\nNetlify: use the Automatic Deploy Subdomain⁠ feature.\n\nYou can configure this environment with either your development API keys (recommended) or you can create an additional production instance and use those production API keys.\n\nSession architecture differences\n\nTip\n\nIn order to understand this section, it's recommended to have a solid understanding of how Clerk's session management architecture works. For more information on this topic, check out the guide on how Clerk works.\n\nClerk manages session state differently in production and development environments.\n\nIn production, Clerk uses a client token to represent the user's session. This client token is stored as an HttpOnly cookie (__client) on the Clerk FAPI domain. Because, in production, FAPI is hosted on a subdomain of your application (e.g., clerk.example.com) via a CNAME record, your app's frontend and FAPI are on the same site. This allows the client token to be securely and reliably sent with each request from your frontend to FAPI using same-site cookies.\n\nHowever, in development, your app's frontend typically runs on a localhost domain, while FAPI for development instances is hosted on a domain ending with accounts.dev. As a result, requests from your app's frontend to FAPI are cross-site, and the client token cannot be securely and reliably stored or transmitted using cookies.\n\nQuiz\n\nWhy can't the client token be securely and reliably stored and transmitted in a cookie when cross-site requests are made?\n\nShow answer\n\nTo address these limitations, development instances use a different approach to maintain session state. An object called the \"dev browser\", which is linked directly to the client token within Clerk's internals, is used to maintain session state across the session lifetime, and is transmitted via querystring (__clerk_db_jwt) rather than via cookie. This strategy allows for a more reliable experience for local development, as it does not require the use of cross-site cookies.\n\nWhile this enables smooth local development workflows, it is not secure enough for production use. Including a sensitive value like the client token in a querystring is not a strong security practice, as it can be seen directly in server logs, browser history, internet providers' logs, and could be potentially intercepted by third-parties via malicious browser extensions or network interceptors. This is why the __clerk_db_jwt object is not used in production instances and the same-site cookie (__client) is used instead.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Machine token usage is free during our public beta period but will be subject to pricing once generally available. Pricing is expected to be competitive and below market averages.\n\nClerk provides a built-in \nauth()\n function that supports token validation via the acceptsToken parameter. This lets you specify which type(s) of token your API route should accept in your TanStack React Start application.\n\nBy default, acceptsToken is set to session_token, which means OAuth tokens will not be accepted unless explicitly configured. You can pass either a single token type or an array of token types to acceptsToken. To learn more about the supported token types, see the \nauth() parameters documentation\n.\n\nExample 1: Accepting a single token type\n\nIn the following example, the acceptsToken parameter is set to only accept oauth_tokens.\n\nIf the token is invalid or missing, auth() will return null for subject and other properties, and the request will be rejected with a 401 response.\nIf the token is valid, it returns the authenticated user's subject and their associated scopes for use in the application logic.\nexport async function clerkAuth({ request }: { request: Request }) {\n  const { subject, scopes } = await auth({\n    acceptsToken: 'oauth_token',\n  })\n\n  // If auth() returns null, the token is invalid\n  if (!subject) {\n    throw new Error('OAuth access token is invalid')\n  }\n\n  return { subject, scopes }\n}\nExample 2: Accepting any token type\n\nIn the following example, the acceptsToken parameter is set to accept any token type.\n\nIf the token is a session_token, it logs that the request is from a user session.\nOtherwise, it logs that the request uses a machine token and specifies its type.\nimport { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'\n\nconst authStateFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {\n  const { tokenType } = await auth({ acceptsToken: 'any' })\n\n  if (tokenType === 'session_token') {\n    console.log('This is a session token from a user')\n  } else {\n    console.log(`This is a ${tokenType} token`)\n  }\n\n  return {}\n})\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

For example, to force users to redirect to a specific URL after signing in, you would use the signInForceRedirectUrl prop on \n<ClerkProvider>\n rather than the CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL environment variable.\n\nSign-in and sign-up redirects\n\nComponents, such as \n<ClerkProvider>\n, \n<SignIn>\n, and more, provide props for you to specify where users will be redirected. For example, <ClerkProvider> has the signInFallbackRedirectUrl and signUpFallbackRedirectUrl props.\n\nHowever, it's recommended to use environment variables instead of these props whenever possible.\n\nFor the FORCE and FALLBACK variables, it's recommended to define both sign-up and sign-in variables, as some users may choose to sign up instead after attempting to sign in, and vice versa.\n\nGeneral\nNext.js\nVariable\tDescription\tExample\nCLERK_SIGN_IN_URL\tThe full URL or path to your sign-in page. Needs to point to your primary application on the client-side. Required for a satellite application in a development instance.\t/sign-in\nCLERK_SIGN_UP_URL\tThe full URL or path to your sign-up page. Needs to point to your primary application on the client-side. Required for a satellite application in a development instance.\t/sign-up\nCLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL\tIf provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs in.\t/dashboard\nCLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL\tIf provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs up.\t/dashboard\nCLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL\tThe fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs in, if there's no redirect_url in the path already. Defaults to /.\t/dashboard\nCLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL\tThe fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs up, if there's no redirect_url in the path already. Defaults to /.\t/dashboard\nClerk Publishable and Secret Keys\n\nTo access your Clerk app in your local project, you must specify your app's Publishable Keys⁠ for use in the frontend, and Secret Keys⁠ for use in the backend.\n\nGeneral\nNext.js\nVariable\tDescription\nCLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\tYour Clerk app's Publishable Key⁠. It will be prefixed with pk_test_ in development instances and pk_live_ in production instances.\nCLERK_SECRET_KEY\tYour Clerk app's Secret Key⁠. It will be prefixed with sk_test_ in development instances and sk_live_ in production instances. Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable.\nAPI and SDK configuration\n\nThe following environment variables enable you to configure API and SDK behavior, such as what version of the SDK your project uses, what proxy URL you use to connect to Clerk's Frontend API, and more.\n\nGeneral\nNext.js\nVariable\tDescription\nCLERK_JS_URL\tSets the URL that @clerk/clerk-react should hot-load @clerk/clerk-js from. CLERK_JS does the same but is deprecated.\nCLERK_JS_VERSION\tSets the npm version for @clerk/clerk-js.\nCLERK_API_URL\tSets the Clerk API URL for debugging. Defaults to \"https://api.clerk.com\"\nCLERK_API_VERSION\tSets the version of the Clerk API to use. Defaults to \"v1\"\nCLERK_JWT_KEY\tSets the JWT verification key that Clerk will use to provide networkless JWT session token verification. Refer to Manual JWT verification.\nCLERK_FAPI\tSets the URL to your Clerk apps' Frontend API.\nCLERK_PROXY_URL\tSets the URL for your proxy.\nSatellite domains\n\nClerk supports sharing sessions across different domains by adding one or many satellite domains to an application. See the satellite domains guide for more information.\n\nGeneral\nNext.js\nVariable\tDescription\nCLERK_DOMAIN\tSets your satellite application's domain. Required to share sessions across multiple domains.\nCLERK_IS_SATELLITE\tIndicates whether or not the application is a satellite application.\nWebhooks\n\nThe following environment variable allows you to protect your webhook signing secret. It is read by Clerk's verifyWebhook() function.\n\nVariable\tDescription\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET\tThe signing secret for your webhook.\nTelemetry\n\nClerk provides environment variables for opting out of telemetry data collection. See the telemetry documentation for more information.\n\nGeneral\nNext.js\nVariable\tDescription\nCLERK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED\tSet this to 1 to disable Clerk's telemetry data collection.\nCLERK_TELEMETRY_DEBUG\tSet this to 1 to prevent telemetry data from being sent to Clerk. It will be logged to the console instead.\nDeprecated\n\nThe following environment variables are deprecated but still supported to avoid breaking changes. Don't use them in new projects. It is recommended to switch to using the recommended alternatives in old projects.\n\nGeneral\nNext.js\nVariable\tDescription\nCLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL\tFull URL or path to navigate to after successful sign up. Defaults to /. CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL and CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL have priority and should be used instead.\nCLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL\tFull URL or path to navigate to after successful sign in. Defaults to /. CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL and CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL have priority and should be used instead.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This is done by passing the user's session token to the backend. The session token contains cryptographically signed claims about the user's identity and authentication state.\n\nAuthenticating a request depends on what type of request you are making. If the request is made from the same origin as the server, Clerk automatically includes the session token in the request. If the request is made from a different origin, you must manually pass the session token in the Authorization header.\n\nRequired headers\n\nThe following headers are required for Clerk to authenticate a request. It contains information that Clerk uses to determine whether a request is in a signed in or signed out state, or if a handshake must be performed.\n\nAuthorization⁠: This should include the user's session token as a Bearer token.\nAccept⁠\nHost⁠\nOrigin⁠\nReferer⁠\nSec-Fetch-Dest⁠\nUser-Agent⁠\nX-Forwarded-Host⁠\nX-Forwarded-Proto⁠\nAlternatively, you can use CloudFront-Forwarded-Proto⁠\nExamples\n\nTo make authenticated requests, the approach differs based on whether your client and server are on the same origin or different origins.\n\nSame-origin requests\n\nIf your client and server are on the same origin (e.g. making an API call to foo.com/api from JavaScript running on foo.com), the session token is automatically passed to the backend in a cookie. All requests to same-origin endpoints are authenticated by default; simply make the request as you normally would and the session token will be included.\n\nUse the following tabs to see how to make authenticated same-origin requests using different frameworks.\n\nHook\nJavaScript\n\nYou can use the native browser Fetch API⁠ as you normally would and the request will be authenticated. The cookie holding the session token is automatically included with same-origin requests.\n\nFetch\nFetch with SWR\nFetch with TanStack Query\nexport default async function useFetch() {\n  const authenticatedFetch = async (...args) => {\n    return fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json())\n  }\n  return authenticatedFetch\n}\nCross-origin requests\n\nIf your client and server are on different origins (e.g. making an API call to a server on api.foo.com from JavaScript running on a client at foo.com), the session token needs to be passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.\n\nYou can retrieve the session token using the getToken() method. Since getToken() returns a Promise, you'll need to await its resolution before making the request.\n\nUse the following tabs to see how to access the getToken() method depending on your framework.\n\nHook\nJavaScript\n\nUse the \nuseAuth()\n hook to access the getToken() method.\n\nFetch\nFetch with SWR\nFetch with TanStack Query\nexport default function useFetch() {\n  // Use `useAuth()` to access the `getToken()` method\n  const { getToken } = useAuth()\n\n  const authenticatedFetch = async (...args) => {\n    // Use `getToken()` to get the current session token\n    const token = await getToken()\n\n    return fetch(...args, {\n      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }, // Include the session token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header\n    }).then((res) => res.json())\n  }\n\n  return authenticatedFetch\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The URL returned from this property can be scaled down with the following image optimization options:\n\n\"width\": Sets the minimum width of the image in pixels.\n\"height\": Sets the minimum height of the image in pixels.\n\"fit\": Describes how the image should fit its container. It can take the following values:\n\"scale-down\": The image will scale down to fit the sizes specified in \"width\" and \"height\" if it's bigger, but will not scale up if it's smaller.\n\"crop\": The image will scale down and be cropped to fit within the area specified in \"width\" and \"height\".\n\"quality\": Specifies the image quality for JPEG, WebP, PNG, and AVIF files. Accepts values from 1 to 100. Defaults to 85.\nExample\n\nThe following example demonstrates how you can get the imageUrl from the currently active user in a session, and display their profile picture using Clerk's image optimization options.\n\nClient-side\nServer-side\n\nOn the client-side, you can use the \nuseClerk()\n hook to get the imageUrl from the currently active user's User object.\n\nexport default function ImageOptimization() {\n  // Use the `useClerk()` hook to get the current user's `User` object\n  const clerk = useClerk()\n  const { user } = clerk\n  if (!user) return <p>No Image URL found</p>\n\n  // Get the image URL from the user's `User` object\n  const { imageUrl } = user\n\n  // Add image optimization options to the image URL\n  const params = new URLSearchParams()\n  params.set('height', '200')\n  params.set('width', '200')\n  params.set('quality', '100')\n  params.set('fit', 'crop')\n\n  // Construct the final image URL with the optimization options\n  const imageSrc = `${imageUrl}?${params.toString()}`\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Image source:</h1>\n      <p>{imageSrc}</p>\n      <h2>Image:</h2>\n      <img src={imageSrc} alt=\"User image\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This makes webhooks seem \"real-time\", but it's important to note that they are asynchronous.\n\nFor example, if you are onboarding a new user, you can't rely on the webhook delivery as part of that flow. Typically the delivery will happen quickly, but it's not guaranteed to be delivered immediately or at all. Webhooks are best used for things like sending a notification or updating a database, but not for synchronous flows where you need to know the webhook was delivered before moving on to the next step. If you need a synchronous flow, see the onboarding guide for an example.\n\nClerk webhooks\n\nClerk webhooks allow you to receive event notifications from Clerk, such as when a user is created or updated. When an event occurs, Clerk will send an HTTP POST request to your webhook endpoint configured for the event type. The payload carries a JSON object. You can then use the information from the request's JSON payload to trigger actions in your app, such as sending a notification or updating a database.\n\nClerk uses Svix⁠ to send our webhooks.\n\nYou can find the Webhook signing secret when you select the endpoint you created on the Webhooks⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nSupported webhook events\n\nTo find a list of all the events Clerk supports:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Webhooks⁠ page.\nSelect the Event Catalog tab.\n\nThere is also a \ndedicated guide\n that describes the events Clerk supports for Billing.\n\nPayload structure\n\nThe payload of a webhook is a JSON object that contains the following properties:\n\ndata: contains the actual payload sent by Clerk. The payload can be a different object depending on the event type. For example, for user.* events, the payload will always be the User object.\nobject: always set to event.\ntype: the type of event that triggered the webhook.\ntimestamp: timestamp in milliseconds of when the event occurred.\ninstance_id: the identifier of your Clerk instance.\n\nThe following example shows the payload of a user.created event:\n\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"birthday\": \"\",\n    \"created_at\": 1654012591514,\n    \"email_addresses\": [\n      {\n        \"email_address\": \"example@example.org\",\n        \"id\": \"idn_29w83yL7CwVlJXylYLxcslromF1\",\n        \"linked_to\": [],\n        \"object\": \"email_address\",\n        \"verification\": {\n          \"status\": \"verified\",\n          \"strategy\": \"ticket\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"external_accounts\": [],\n    \"external_id\": \"567772\",\n    \"first_name\": \"Example\",\n    \"gender\": \"\",\n    \"id\": \"user_29w83sxmDNGwOuEthce5gg56FcC\",\n    \"image_url\": \"https://img.clerk.com/xxxxxx\",\n    \"last_name\": \"Example\",\n    \"last_sign_in_at\": 1654012591514,\n    \"object\": \"user\",\n    \"password_enabled\": true,\n    \"phone_numbers\": [],\n    \"primary_email_address_id\": \"idn_29w83yL7CwVlJXylYLxcslromF1\",\n    \"primary_phone_number_id\": null,\n    \"primary_web3_wallet_id\": null,\n    \"private_metadata\": {},\n    \"profile_image_url\": \"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar?d=mp\",\n    \"public_metadata\": {},\n    \"two_factor_enabled\": false,\n    \"unsafe_metadata\": {},\n    \"updated_at\": 1654012591835,\n    \"username\": null,\n    \"web3_wallets\": []\n  },\n  \"instance_id\": \"ins_123\",\n  \"object\": \"event\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1654012591835,\n  \"type\": \"user.created\"\n}\n\nThe payload should always be treated as unsafe until you validate the incoming webhook. Webhooks will originate from another server and be sent to your application as a POST request. A bad actor would fake a webhook event to try and gain access to your application or data.\n\nHow Clerk handles delivery issues\nRetry\n\nSvix will use a set schedule and retry any webhooks that fail. To see the up-to-date schedule, see the Svix Retry Schedule⁠.\n\nIf Svix is attempting and failing to send a webhook, and that endpoint is removed or disabled from the Webhooks⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard, then the attempts will also be disabled.\n\nReplay\n\nIf a webhook message or multiple webhook messages fail to send, you have the option to replay the webhook messages. This protects against your service having downtime or against a misconfigured endpoint.\n\nTo replay webhook messages:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Webhooks⁠ page.\nSelect the affected endpoint.\nIn the Message Attempts section, next to the message you want to replay, select the menu icon on the right side, and then select Replay.\nThe Replay Messages menu will appear. You can choose to:\nResend the specific message you selected.\nResend all failed messages since the first failed message in that date range.\nResend all missing messages since the first failed message in that date range.\nSync data to your database\n\nYou can find a guide on how to use webhooks to sync your data to your database here.\n\nProtect your webhooks from abuse\n\nTo ensure that the API route receiving the webhook can only be hit by your app, there are a few protections you should put in place:\n\nVerify the request signature: Svix webhook requests are signed⁠ and can be verified to ensure the request is not malicious. To verify the signature, use Clerk's verifyWebhook⁠ helper. To learn more, see Svix's guide on how to verify webhooks with the svix libraries⁠ or how to verify webhooks manually⁠.\n\nOnly accept requests coming from Svix's webhook IPs⁠: To further prevent attackers from flooding your servers or wasting your compute, you can ensure that your webhook-receiving api routes only accept requests coming from Svix's webhook IPs⁠, rejecting all other requests.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Read the next few sections carefully to determine if this is the right approach for your app.\n\nWhen to sync Clerk data\n\nSyncing data with webhooks can be a suitable approach for some applications, but it comes with important considerations. Webhook deliveries are not guaranteed and may occasionally fail due to problems like network issues, so your implementation should be prepared to handle retries and error scenarios. Additionally, syncing data via webhooks is eventually consistent⁠, meaning there can be a delay between when a Clerk event (such as a user being created or updated) occurs and when the corresponding data is reflected in your database. If not managed carefully, this delay can introduce bugs and race conditions.\n\nIf you can access the necessary data directly from the Clerk session token, you can achieve strong consistency while avoiding the overhead of maintaining a separate user table in your own database and the latency of retrieving that data on every request. This makes not syncing data much more efficient, if your use case allows for it.\n\nThe most notable use case for syncing Clerk data is if your app has social features where users can see content posted by other users. This is because Clerk's frontend API only allows you to access information about the currently signed-in user. If your app needs to display information about other users, like their names or avatars, you can't access that data from the frontend API alone. While you can fetch other users' data using Clerk's backend API for each request, this is slow compared to a database lookup, and you risk hitting rate limits. In this case, it makes sense to store user data in your own database and sync it from Clerk.\n\nStoring extra user data\n\nIf you want to use webhooks to sync Clerk data because you want to store extra data for the user, consider the following approaches:\n\n(Recommended) If it's more than 1.2KB, you could store only the extra user data in your own database.\n\nStore the user's Clerk ID as a column in the users table in your own database, and only store extra user data. When you need to access Clerk user data, access it directly from the Clerk session token. When you need to access the extra user data, do a lookup in your database using the Clerk user ID. Consider indexing the Clerk user ID column since it will be used frequently for lookups.\nFor example, Clerk doesn't collect a user's birthday, country, or bio, but if you wanted to collect these fields, you could store them in your own database like this:\nid\tclerk_id\tbirthday\tcountry\tbio\nuser123abc\tuser_123\t1990-05-12\tUSA\tCoffee enthusiast.\nuser456abc\tuser_456\t1985-11-23\tCanada\tLoves to read.\nuser789abc\tuser_789\t2001-07-04\tGermany\tStudent and coder.\n\nIf it's less than 1.2KB, you could use Clerk metadata and store it in the user's session token.\n\nFor minimal custom data (under 1.2KB), you can store it in a user's metadata instead of dealing with a separate users table. Then, you can store the metadata in the user's session token to avoid making a network request to Clerk's Backend API when retrieving it. However, if there's any chance that a user will ever have more than 1.2KB of extra data, you should use the other approach, as you risk cookie size overflows if metadata is over 1.2KB.\nAnother limitation to consider is that metadata cannot be queried, so you can't use it to filter users by metadata. For example, if you stored a user's birthday in metadata, you couldn't find all users with a certain birthday. If you need to query the data that you're storing, you should store it in your own database instead.\n\nA hybrid approach of the two approaches above.\n\nHow to sync Clerk data\n\nIn this guide, you'll set up a webhook in your app to listen for the user.created event, create an endpoint in the Clerk Dashboard, build a handler for verifying the webhook, and test it locally using ngrok and the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nClerk offers many events, but three key events include:\n\nuser.created: Triggers when a new user registers in the app or is created via the Clerk Dashboard or Backend API. Listening to this event allows the initial insertion of user information in your database.\nuser.updated: Triggers when user information is updated via Clerk components, the Clerk Dashboard, or Backend API. Listening to this event keeps data synced between Clerk and your external database. It is recommended to only sync what you need to simplify this process.\nuser.deleted: Triggers when a user deletes their account, or their account is removed via the Clerk Dashboard or Backend API. Listening to this event allows you to delete the user from your database or add a deleted: true flag.\n\nThese steps apply to any Clerk event. To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your Clerk Webhooks⁠ page and one for your ngrok dashboard⁠.\n\nSet up ngrok\n\nTo test a webhook locally, you need to expose your local server to the internet. This guide uses ngrok⁠ which creates a forwarding URL that sends the webhook payload to your local server.\n\nNavigate to the ngrok dashboard⁠ to create an account.\nOn the ngrok dashboard homepage, follow the setup guide⁠ instructions. Under Deploy your app online, select Static domain. Run the provided command, replacing the port number with your server's port. For example, if your development server runs on port 3000, the command should resemble ngrok http --url=<YOUR_FORWARDING_URL> 3000. This creates a free static domain and starts a tunnel.\nSave your Forwarding URL somewhere secure.\nSet up a webhook endpoint\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Webhooks⁠ page.\nSelect Add Endpoint.\nIn the Endpoint URL field, paste the ngrok Forwarding URL you saved earlier, followed by /api/webhooks. This is the endpoint that Clerk uses to send the webhook payload. The full URL should resemble https://fawn-two-nominally.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks.\nIn the Subscribe to events section, scroll down and select user.created.\nSelect Create. You'll be redirected to your endpoint's settings page. Keep this page open.\nAdd your Signing Secret to .env\n\nTo verify the webhook payload, you'll need your endpoint's Signing Secret. Since you don't want this secret exposed in your codebase, store it as an environment variable in your .env file during local development.\n\nOn the endpoint's settings page in the Clerk Dashboard, copy the Signing Secret. You may need to select the eye icon to reveal the secret.\nIn your project's root directory, open or create an .env file, which should already include your Clerk API keys. Assign your Signing Secret to CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET. The file should resemble:\n.env\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\nCLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_123\nMake sure the webhook route is public\n\nIncoming webhook events don't contain auth information. They come from an external source and aren't signed in or out, so the route must be public to allow access. If you're using clerkMiddleware(), ensure that the /api/webhooks(.*) route is set as public. For information on configuring routes, see the \nclerkMiddleware() guide\n.\n\nCreate a route handler to verify the webhook\n\nSet up a Route Handler that uses Clerk's verifyWebhook() function to verify the incoming Clerk webhook and process the payload.\n\nFor this guide, the payload will be logged to the console. In a real app, you'd use the payload to trigger an action. For example, if listening for the user.created event, you might perform a database create or upsert to add the user's Clerk data to your database's user table.\n\nIf the route handler returns a 4xx⁠ or 5xx code⁠, or no code at all, the webhook event will be retried. If the route handler returns a 2xx code⁠, the event will be marked as successful, and retries will stop.\n\nNote\n\nThe following Route Handler can be used for any webhook event you choose to listen to. It is not specific to user.created.\n\nNext.js\nAstro\nExpress\nFastify\nNuxt\nReact Router\nTanStack React Start\n\nFirst, configure Vite to allow the ngrok host in your app.config.ts. You only need to do this in development when tunneling your local server (e.g. localhost:3000/api/webhooks) to a public URL (e.g. https://fawn-two-nominally.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks). In production, you won't need this configuration because your webhook endpoint will be hosted on your app's production domain (e.g. https://your-app.com/api/webhooks).\n\napp.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  server: {\n    // Replace with your ngrok host\n    allowedHosts: ['fawn-two-nominally.ngrok-free.app'],\n  },\n})\n\nThen create your webhook handler:\n\napp/routes/api/webhooks.ts\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/webhooks'\nimport { createServerFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'\n\nexport const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({\n  POST: async ({ request }) => {\n    try {\n      const evt = await verifyWebhook(request)\n\n      // Do something with payload\n      // For this guide, log payload to console\n      const { id } = evt.data\n      const eventType = evt.type\n      console.log(`Received webhook with ID ${id} and event type of ${eventType}`)\n      console.log('Webhook payload:', evt.data)\n\n      return new Response('Webhook received', { status: 200 })\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err)\n      return new Response('Error verifying webhook', { status: 400 })\n    }\n  },\n})\nNarrow to a webhook event for type inference\n\nWebhookEvent encompasses all possible webhook types. Narrow down the event type for accurate typing for specific events.\n\nIn the following example, the if statement narrows the type to user.created, enabling type-safe access to evt.data with autocompletion.\n\napp/api/webhooks/route.ts\n- console.log(`Received webhook with ID ${id} and event type of ${eventType}`)\n- console.log('Webhook payload:', body)\n  \n+ if (evt.type === 'user.created') {\n+   console.log('userId:', evt.data.id)\n+ }\n\nTo handle types manually, import the following types from your backend SDK (e.g., @clerk/nextjs/webhooks):\n\nDeletedObjectJSON\nEmailJSON\nOrganizationInvitationJSON\nOrganizationJSON\nOrganizationMembershipJSON\nSessionJSON\nSMSMessageJSON\nUserJSON\nTest the webhook\nStart your Next.js server.\nIn your endpoint's settings page in the Clerk Dashboard, select the Testing tab.\nIn the Select event dropdown, select user.created.\nSelect Send Example.\nIn the Message Attempts section, confirm that the event's Status is labeled with Succeeded. In your server's terminal where your app is running, you should see the webhook's payload.\nHandling failed messages\nIn the Message Attempts section, select the event whose Status is labeled with Failed.\nScroll down to the Webhook Attempts section.\nToggle the arrow next to the Status column.\nReview the error. Solutions vary by error type. For more information, refer to the guide on debugging your webhooks.\nTrigger the webhook\n\nTo trigger the user.created event, create a new user in your app.\n\nIn the terminal where your app is running, you should see the webhook's payload logged. You can also check the Clerk Dashboard to see the webhook attempt, the same way you did when testing the webhook.\n\nConfigure your production instance\nWhen you're ready to deploy your app to production, follow the guide on deploying your Clerk app to production.\nCreate your production webhook by following the steps in the previous Set up a webhook endpoint section. In the Endpoint URL field, instead of pasting the ngrok URL, paste your production app URL.\nAfter you've set up your webhook endpoint, you'll be redirected to your endpoint's settings page. Copy the Signing Secret.\nOn your hosting platform, update your environment variables on your hosting platform by adding Signing Secret with the key of CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET.\nRedeploy your app.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This reference describes the events Clerk supports for Billing. For more information about webhooks, see the dedicated guide.\n\nSubscriptions\n\nA Subscription is a top-level container unique to each user or organization. Subscription events can help you track billing changes for each of your customers.\n\nEvent Name\tDescription\nsubscription.created\tThe top-level Subscription is created. This usually happens when a user or organization is created. For existing users and organizations, a Subscription will be created when Billing is enabled for the application.\nsubscription.updated\tThe top-level Subscription is updated. This event is triggered when any property of the Subscription has changed, except for status changes. For example, when the Subscription Items for the payer change.\nsubscription.active\tThe top-level Subscription transitions to active from a non-active status. This happens when any Subscription Item is set to active, including items from the free default Plan.\nsubscription.pastDue\tThe top-level Subscription contains a Subscription Item that has become past due.\nSubscription Items\n\nA Subscription Item provides details about the relationship between the payer (user or Organization) and a Plan. A top-level Subscription may contain multiple Subscription Items.\n\nThere can only be one active Subscription Item per payer and Plan. In addition, the Subscription Item for the default Plan will always have the same id to allow easier tracking of which users and Organizations are not paid customers.\n\nEvent Name\tDescription\nsubscriptionItem.updated\tThe Subscription Item is updated. This event is triggered when a property of the Subscription Item has changed that does not result in a status change. For example, when a Subscription Item is renewed and the recurring monthly charge succeeds, the status doesn't change (remains active), but period_start and period_end are updated. This results in a subscriptionItem.updated event.\nsubscriptionItem.active\tThe Subscription Item is set to active. For paid Plans, this happens on successful payment.\nsubscriptionItem.canceled\tThe Subscription Item is canceled. The payer retains Plan features until the end of the current billing period.\nsubscriptionItem.upcoming\tThe Subscription Item is set as upcoming after the current billing period. This can happen in the case of a deferred Plan change from a higher-priced to lower-priced Plan. In the case a paid Plan is canceled, the Subscription Item for the default, free Plan will be set as upcoming.\nsubscriptionItem.ended\tThe Subscription Item has ended.\nsubscriptionItem.abandoned\tThe Subscription Item is abandoned. This can happen to upcoming Subscription Items if the payer subscribes to another Plan, or re-subscribes to a currently canceled Plan.\nsubscriptionItem.incomplete\tThe Subscription Item is incomplete. This means the payer has started a checkout for a Plan, but the payment hasn't been successfully processed yet. Once payment succeeds, the Subscription Item transitions to an active status.\nsubscriptionItem.pastDue\tThe Subscription Item is past due because a recurring charge has failed.\nsubscriptionItem.freeTrialEnding\tThe Subscription Item is a free trial and is ending soon. This event is sent three days before the trial ends. If the trial is shorter than three days, it's sent immediately.\nPayment attempts\n\nPayment attempts allow you to track successful and failed payments, for both checkout and recurring charges.\n\nPayment attempt events contain a type, which can be either checkout or recurring. You can use these values to determine whether a payment attempt was for a checkout or a Subscription Item renewal's recurring charge.\n\nEvent Name\tDescription\npaymentAttempt.created\tA payment attempt has been created with pending status. It can either succeed or fail in the future.\npaymentAttempt.updated\tA payment attempt has been updated to paid or failed status.\n\nLooking for other webhook events?

It can be hard to debug when something goes awry. This guide will cover the basics for debugging and help you to direct your attention to the correct spot.\n\nWebhooks and local development\n\nWhen you or a user of your application performs certain actions, a webhook can be triggered. You can see the full list of webhook events for a list of the actions that could result in a Webhook. Depending on the events subscribed to in the Webhooks⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard, a webhook event will be triggered and sent to the specified endpoint in your application.\n\nWhen you are developing on your localhost, your application is not internet facing and can't receive the webhook request. You will need to use a tool that creates a tunnel from the internet to your localhost. These tools will provide temporary or permanent URLs depending on the tool and the plan you subscribe to. Popular tools include ngrok, localtunnel, and Cloudflare Tunnel.\n\nDebugging webhook-related issues can be tricky, so the following sections address common issues and how to resolve them.\n\nCheck your Middleware configuration\n\nIncoming webhook events will never be signed in -- they are coming from a source outside of your application. Since they will be in a signed out state, the route should be public.\n\nThe following example shows the recommended Middleware configuration for your webhook routes.\n\nproxy.tsx\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\n// Make sure that the `/api/webhooks/(.*)` route is not protected here\nexport default clerkMiddleware()\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params\n    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',\n    // Always run for API routes\n    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',\n  ],\n}\nTest the Route Handler or API Route\n\nIf you are having trouble with your webhook, you can create a basic Route Handler to test it locally.\n\nCreate a test route by adding the following file and code to your application:\nexport async function POST() {\n  return Response.json({ message: 'The route is working' })\n}\nRun your application.\nSend a request to the test route using the following command:\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/test\n\nIf you see the {\"message\":\"The route is working\"}, then the basic Route Handler is working and ready to build on.\n\nImportant\n\nYour webhook needs to return a success code like 200 or 201 when it has been successfully handled. This will mark the webhook as successful in the Dashboard and prevent retries.\n\nCheck your configuration in the Clerk Dashboard\n\nWhether you are developing locally or deploying to production, the webhook URL provided in your webhook endpoint⁠ must be exact and correct. The URL breaks down into three parts:\n\nthe protocol (http vs https) - Whether in development using a tunnel or in production, the URL will almost always use https so ensure that the protocol is correct.\nthe domain (domain.com) - The domain needs to be exact. A common error in production is not including the www.. Unlike entering a domain in your browser, a webhook will not be redirected from domain.com to www.domain.com. If your application lives on www.domain.com then the webhook URL must use that.\nthe path (/api/webhooks/user) - The path must match the path in your application.\nDebug your tunnel and webhook delivery\n\nIf your webhook is still getting errors after testing its route locally and verifying the endpoint's configuration in the Clerk Dashboard, you can further investigate the specific errors returned by the webhook. Depending on the type of error, your approach to fixing the webhook will vary.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Webhooks⁠ page.\nSelect the endpoint for which you want to test.\nIn the Message attempts table, you will likely see that one or more of those attempts have failed. Select the failed attempt to expand it.\nIn the details for the attempt, there will be a HTTP RESPONSE CODE. The code will likely be either a 500 or a 4xx error, which will indicate there is some misconfiguration.\nCommon HTTP response codes\n\nThe following table has some of the common response codes you might see and what they indicate. This is not an exhaustive list and you may need to research the code or error you are receiving. See HTTP response status codes⁠ from MDN for reference.\n\nCode\tInformation\n400\tUsually indicates the verification failed, but could be caused by other issues.\n401\tThe request was not authorized. If your test in the Test the Route Handler or API Route section worked, you should not see this error. If you are seeing it, then you will need to configure your Middleware to accept the request.\n404\tThe URL for the webhook was not found. Check that your application is running and that the endpoint is correct in the Clerk Dashboard.\n405\tYour route is not accepting a POST request. All webhooks are POST requests and the route must accept them. Unless you are using the route for something else, you can restrict the route to POST requests only.\n500\tThe request made it to your application, but there is a code-related issue. This is likely a webhook verification issue or something in the webhook logic. See the following sections.\nDebug webhook verification\n\nTo verify the webhook, see the guide on webhooks for a detailed code example. You can also visit the Svix guide on verifying payloads⁠.\n\nDiagnosing a problem in this part of the webhook can be challenging. Your best bet would be the liberal use of console.log. You could log out the following to check if the values are correct:\n\nthe signing secret\nthe headers\nthe body before verifying\nthe result of the .verify() attempt\n\nThe results of these will appear in the command line where you are running your application.\n\nChecking the values and the progress of the webhook code will allow you to narrow down where the code is failing. They will often return null or errors where they should be returning values.\n\nCheck your logic\n\nOnce you have verified the webhook, you will now be writing your own code to handle the values from the webhook. This could range from saving data to a database, or integrating with another system, to updating users or sending emails or SMS.\n\nIf the webhook is verified and you're seeing a 500 status code or your webhook is not behaving as expected, remember that you can use console.log to help diagnose what the problem is. Console logs and errors will be displayed on your command line, allowing you to see what's happening and address the bugs.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Paired with Clerk's user authentication and management features, you can build a powerful application with minimal effort. This tutorial will show you how to integrate Clerk into your Convex application. It assumes that you have already integrated both Convex and one of Clerk's SDKs into your app.\n\nCreate a JWT template based on Convex\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the JWT templates⁠ page.\nSelect New template and then from the list of templates, select Convex. You'll be redirected to the template's settings page.\nCopy and save the Issuer URL somewhere secure. This URL is the issuer domain for Clerk's JWT templates, which is your application's Frontend API URL⁠. In development, it's format will be https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev. In production, it's format will be https://clerk.<your-domain>.com.\nMap additional claims (optional)\n\nIn the Claims section, the default audience (aud) claim required by Convex is pre-mapped, as well as some other helpful claims like Convex's name claim to Clerk's user.full_name claim. You can include additional claims as necessary. Shortcodes are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.\n\nConfigure Convex with the Clerk issuer domain\nIn your env file, add your Issuer URL as the CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL environment variable. If you already have it set, great!\n.env\nCLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL\nIn your app's convex folder, create a auth.config.js file with the following configuration:\nconvex/auth.config.js\nexport default {\n  providers: [\n    {\n      domain: process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL,\n      applicationID: 'convex',\n    },\n  ],\n}\nDeploy your changes to Convex\n\nRun npx convex dev to automatically sync your configuration to your backend.\n\nConfigure the Clerk and Convex providers\n\nBoth Clerk and Convex have provider components that are required to provide authentication and client context. You should already have Clerk's provider component, <ClerkProvider>, in your app. Convex offers a provider that is specifically for integrating with Clerk called <ConvexProviderWithClerk>.\n\nNext.js\nReact\n\n<ConvexProviderWithClerk> calls ConvexReactClient() to get Convex's client, so it must be used in a Client Component. Your app/layout.tsx, where you would use <ConvexProviderWithClerk>, is a Server Component, and a Server Component cannot contain Client Component code. To solve this, you must first create a wrapper Client Component around <ConvexProviderWithClerk>.\n\ncomponents/ConvexClientProvider.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { ReactNode } from 'react'\nimport { ConvexReactClient } from 'convex/react'\nimport { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from 'convex/react-clerk'\nimport { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nif (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL) {\n  throw new Error('Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL in your .env file')\n}\n\nconst convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL)\n\nexport default function ConvexClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>\n      {children}\n    </ConvexProviderWithClerk>\n  )\n}\n\nNow, your Server Component, app/layout.tsx, can use the wrapper component, <ConvexClientProvider>. It's important that <ClerkProvider> wraps <ConvexClientProvider>, and not the other way around, as Convex needs to be able to access the Clerk context.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\nimport { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\nimport './globals.css'\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport ConvexClientProvider from '@/components/ConvexClientProvider'\n\nconst geistSans = Geist({\n  variable: '--font-geist-sans',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n})\n\nconst geistMono = Geist_Mono({\n  variable: '--font-geist-mono',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n})\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Clerk Next.js Quickstart',\n  description: 'Generated by create next app',\n}\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: Readonly<{\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}>) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>\n        <ClerkProvider>\n          <ConvexClientProvider>{children}</ConvexClientProvider>\n        </ClerkProvider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nShow UI based on auth state\n\nYou can control which UI is shown when the user is signed in or signed out using Convex's <Authenticated>, <Unauthenticated> and <AuthLoading> helper components. These should be used instead of Clerk's <SignedIn>, <SignedOut> and <ClerkLoading> components, respectively.\n\nIt's important to use the useConvexAuth()⁠ hook instead of Clerk's useAuth() hook when you need to check whether the user is signed in or not. The useConvexAuth() hook makes sure that the browser has fetched the auth token needed to make authenticated requests to your Convex backend, and that the Convex backend has validated it.\n\nIn the following example, the <Content /> component is a child of <Authenticated>, so its content and any of its child components are guaranteed to have an authenticated user, and Convex queries can require authentication.\n\nNext.js\nReact\n'use client'\n\nimport { Authenticated, Unauthenticated } from 'convex/react'\nimport { SignInButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useQuery } from 'convex/react'\nimport { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Authenticated>\n        <UserButton />\n        <Content />\n      </Authenticated>\n      <Unauthenticated>\n        <SignInButton />\n      </Unauthenticated>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Content() {\n  const messages = useQuery(api.messages.getForCurrentUser)\n  return <div>Authenticated content: {messages?.length}</div>\n}\nUse auth state in your Convex functions\n\nIf the client is authenticated, you can access the information stored in the JWT via ctx.auth.getUserIdentity.\n\nIf the client isn't authenticated, ctx.auth.getUserIdentity will return null.\n\nMake sure that the component calling this query is a child of <Authenticated> from convex/react. Otherwise, it will throw on page load.\n\nconvex/messages.ts\nimport { query } from './_generated/server'\n\nexport const getForCurrentUser = query({\n  args: {},\n  handler: async (ctx) => {\n    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()\n    if (identity === null) {\n      throw new Error('Not authenticated')\n    }\n    return await ctx.db\n      .query('messages')\n      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field('author'), identity.email))\n      .collect()\n  },\n})\nNext steps\n\nBe aware that Convex may require usage of their custom hooks and methods rather than Clerk's, such as using Convex's useConvexAuth() hook instead of Clerk's useAuth() hook in some cases.

For new applications, you cannot enable the integration. However, existing applications with the integration previously enabled will continue to function and can still be configured, but once disabled, it cannot be re-enabled.\n\nLearn how to migrate your Firebase users to Clerk.\n\nIntegrating Firebase with Clerk gives you the benefits of using Firebase's features while leveraging Clerk's authentication, prebuilt components, and webhooks.\n\nConfigure the integration\n\nThe Firebase integration enables you to use Clerk to generate a valid authentication token to send to Firebase Auth. This enables you to leverage Clerk's prebuilt components, auth provider options, and more, while accessing Firebase products like Firestore with a session validated by Firebase Auth.\n\nTo get started, enable the integration:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Integrations⁠ page.\nToggle the Firebase integration on. The configuration modal will appear. Keep this open while you configure your Firebase project.\n\nNext, configure your integration.\n\nConfigure automatically (Recommended)\nConfigure manually\n\nThe recommended way to configure your integration is to use a service account key provided by Firebase in order to configure the integration automatically. To do so:\n\nIn your Firebase project, visit the Service Accounts settings⁠.\nNear the bottom of the page, select the Generate new private key button.\nIn the modal that pops up, select the Generate key button to download the JSON file that contains your service account key.\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, the Firebase configuration modal should still be open. Select the Upload service account key button and upload the JSON file you downloaded.\nThe appropriate fields in the configuration modal will be filled in automatically. Select Apply changes to save your configuration.\n\nSelect the Configure manually tab above these instructions if you do not want to use a service account key.\n\nEnable authentication in Firebase\n\nTo use Firebase auth, ensure authentication is enabled in your Firebase dashboard. To do so:\n\nNavigate to your Firebase dashboard.\nIn the navigation sidenav, select the Build dropdown and select Authentication⁠.\nSelect Get started.\nEnable any sign-in method you want, such as Email/Password.\nAdd a Security Rule to your Firestore database (optional)\n\nAdding the Cloud Firestore⁠ feature in your Firebase application is optional.\n\nTo use Firestore with Clerk, ensure that you have defined Security Rules⁠ that allow authenticated requests to access your database. For example:\n\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /{document=**} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;\n    }\n  }\n}\nGet your Firebase config object\n\nTo connect to your Firebase app in your code, you need a config object from your Firebase project. To find it:\n\nVisit your Firebase project settings⁠.\nIn the Your apps section, there should be a code snippet that includes the firebaseConfig object. Copy this object. It should look similar to the following:\nconst firebaseConfig = {\n  apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\n  authDomain: 'clerk-example-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com',\n  databaseURL: 'https://clerk-example-xxxxx-default-xxxx.firebaseio.com',\n  projectId: 'clerk-test-xxxx',\n  storageBucket: 'clerk-test-xxxx.appspot.com',\n  messagingSenderId: '012345678910',\n  appId: '1:012345678:web:abcdef123456hijklm',\n  measurementId: 'G-ABC123DEF',\n}\nSave this information somewhere secure. You'll need it to connect to your Firebase app.\n\nSee Google's Firebase documentation⁠ for more information on the config object.\n\nUse Firebase with Clerk in your code\n\nNow that you have configured the integration, and you have retrieved your Firebase config object, it's time to use Firebase with Clerk in your code.\n\nThe following example:\n\nExpects the user to be signed into the app with Clerk.\nCreates a button for signing into your Firebase app, which uses Clerk to generate an authentication token for Firebase's API.\nCreates a button for fetching example data from your Firestore database.\n\nThis example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\napp/firebase/page.tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app'\nimport { getAuth, signInWithCustomToken } from 'firebase/auth'\nimport { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore'\nimport { doc, getDoc } from 'firebase/firestore'\n\n// Add your Firebase config object\nconst firebaseConfig = {\n  apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\n  authDomain: 'clerk-example-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com',\n  databaseURL: 'https://clerk-example-xxxxx-default-xxxx.firebaseio.com',\n  projectId: 'clerk-test-xxxx',\n  storageBucket: 'clerk-test-xxxx.appspot.com',\n  messagingSenderId: '012345678910',\n  appId: '1:012345678:web:abcdef123456hijklm',\n  measurementId: 'G-ABC123DEF',\n}\n\n// Connect to your Firebase app\nconst app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)\n// Connect to your Firestore database\nconst db = getFirestore(app)\n// Connect to Firebase auth\nconst auth = getAuth(app)\n\n// Remove this if you do not have Firestore set up\n// for your Firebase app\nconst getFirestoreData = async () => {\n  const docRef = doc(db, 'example', 'example-document')\n  const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef)\n  if (docSnap.exists()) {\n    console.log('Document data:', docSnap.data())\n  } else {\n    // docSnap.data() will be undefined in this case\n    console.log('No such document!')\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function FirebaseUI() {\n  const { getToken, isSignedIn } = useAuth()\n\n  // Handle if the user is not signed in\n  // You could display content, or redirect them to a sign-in page\n  if (!isSignedIn) {\n    return <p>You need to sign in with Clerk to access this page.</p>\n  }\n\n  const signIntoFirebaseWithClerk = async () => {\n    const token = await getToken({ template: 'integration_firebase' })\n\n    const userCredentials = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token || '')\n    // The userCredentials.user object can call the methods of\n    // the Firebase platform as an authenticated user.\n    console.log('User:', userCredentials.user)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <main style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', rowGap: '1rem' }}>\n      <button onClick={signIntoFirebaseWithClerk}>Sign in</button>\n\n      {/* Remove this button if you do not have Firestore set up */}\n      <button onClick={getFirestoreData}>Get document</button>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\nNext steps\nUse webhooks to sync Firebase data with Clerk\n\nLearn how to sync Firebase auth or Firestore data with Clerk data using webhooks.\n\nCreate a custom sign-in-or-up page in your Next.js app\n\nLearn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your Next.js app with Clerk components.\n\nDeploy to production\n\nLearn how to deploy your Clerk app to production.\n\nDeploy to Vercel\n\nLearn how to deploy your Clerk app to production on Vercel.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

You'll be redirected to the template's settings page.\nCopy and save the Issuer URL somewhere secure. This URL is the issuer domain for Clerk's JWT templates, which is your application's Frontend API URL⁠. In development, it's format will be https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev. In production, it's format will be https://clerk.<your-domain>.com.\nMap additional claims (optional)\n\nIn the Claims section, the default claims required by Grafbase are pre-mapped. You can include additional claims as necessary. For example, if your GraphQL API restricts access based on groups, you'll need to specify the user groups in the groups claim. So you would add something like:\n\n{\n  \"groups\": [\"org:admin\", \"org:member\"]\n}\nConfigure Grafbase with the issuer domain\nIn your env file, add your Issuer URL as the CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL environment variable. If you already have it set, great!\n.env\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL\nIn your Grafbase app, update your schema with the following:\nschema\n  @auth(\n    providers: [{ type: oidc, issuer: \"{{ process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL }}\" }]\n    rules: [{ allow: private }]\n  ) {\n  query: Query\n}\nIf you're working with group-based user access, add allow: groups to the @auth rules, and provide an array of your user groups to the groups property:\nschema\n  @auth(\n    providers: [{ type: oidc, issuer: \"{{ process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL }}\" }]\n    rules: [{ allow: groups, groups: [\"backend\", \"admin\"] }]\n  ) {\n  query: Query\n}\nAuthenticate requests\n\nWhen making requests to your Grafbase API, you must send Clerk's session token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.\n\nTo retrieve Clerk's session token, use the getToken() method returned by the \nuseAuth()\n hook. You'll need to pass the template name you created in the previous step to the getToken() method. The following example uses the default template name, grafbase.\n\nWith SWR\nWith Apollo\nexport const useQuery = (query, variables) => {\n  if (!query) {\n    throw Error('No query provided to `useQuery`')\n  }\n\n  // Use Clerk's `useAuth()` hook to access the `getToken()` method\n  const { getToken } = useAuth()\n\n  const fetcher = async () => {\n    // Retrieve Clerk's session token using the template you created in the Clerk Dashboard\n    const token = await getToken({ template: 'grafbase' })\n\n    try {\n      const response = await fetch('YOUR_GRAFBASE_API', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: {\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n          authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, // Send the session token as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables }),\n      })\n      return response.json()\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error(err)\n    }\n  }\n  return useSWR(query, fetcher)\n}\n\nconst YOUR_GRAPHQL_QUERY = `\n\tquery {\n\t\t__schema {\n\t\t\ttypes {\n\t\t\t\tname\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n`\n\nconst SchemaPage = () => {\n  const { data, error } = useQuery(YOUR_GRAPHQL_QUERY)\n  if (error) {\n    return <div>error</div>\n  }\n  return <pre>{JSON.stringify({ data }, 2, null)}</pre>\n}\n\nexport default SchemaPage\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.\n\nConfigure your Clerk session token\n\nInstantDB uses Clerk's session token to authenticate users. To use InstantDB with Clerk, you need to include the email claim in your Clerk session token.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Sessions⁠ page.\n\nUnder Customize session token, in the Claims editor, enter the following JSON and select Save. If you have already customized your session token, you may need to merge this with what you currently have.\n\n{\n  \"email\": \"{{user.primary_email_address}}\"\n}\n\nYou can have additional claims as long as the email claim is set to {{user.primary_email_address}}.\n\nGet your Clerk Publishable Key\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the API keys⁠ page.\nIn the Quick Copy section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key⁠.\nConfigure InstantDB\nIn the InstantDB dashboard, navigate to the Auth⁠ tab.\nAt the top of the page, save the Public App ID somewhere as you'll need this later.\nSelect Setup Clerk.\nAdd the Clerk Publishable Key⁠ you copied in the previous step.\nConfirm the The session token has the \"email\" claim. message.\nSelect Add Clerk app. Save the Client Name somewhere as you'll need this later.\nInstall the InstantDB library\n\nIf you haven't already added InstantDB to your app, run the following command to install it:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm install @instantdb/react\nSet your InstantDB credentials\n\nIn your .env file, set the following environment variables to your InstantDB App ID and Clerk Client Name that you saved earlier:\n\n.env\nNEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANTDB_APP_ID=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_CLIENT_NAME=\nInitialize InstantDB in your app\n\nTo initialize InstantDB⁠ in your app:\n\nCreate a db directory.\nIn the db directory, create a instant.ts file with the following code. It initializes InstantDB with your App ID and schema. The schema used below is necessary for this tutorial, but you can customize it as needed. Read more about InstantDB schemas in the InstantDB docs⁠.\ndb/instant.ts\nimport { i, init } from '@instantdb/react'\n\nconst APP_ID = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANTDB_APP_ID\n\nif (!APP_ID) {\n  throw new Error('Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANTDB_APP_ID in your .env file')\n}\n\n// Optional: Declare your schema\nexport const schema = i.schema({\n  entities: {\n    todos: i.entity({\n      text: i.string(),\n      done: i.boolean(),\n      createdAt: i.number(),\n    }),\n  },\n})\n\nexport const db = init({ appId: APP_ID, schema })\nManage the Clerk and InstantDB auth sessions\n\nIntegrating InstantDB with Clerk means that your users will sign in to your app using Clerk, and then Clerk's session token will be used to sign the user in to InstantDB. This means that your user will have two sessions: one with Clerk and one with InstantDB. In order to handle both sessions, the following component uses Clerk to check if the user is signed in, and if they are, it uses Clerk's session token to sign the user in to InstantDB. If the user is not signed in to Clerk, it signs them out of InstantDB, ensuring that if the Clerk session ends, the InstantDB session will end as well.\n\ncomponents/InstantDBAuthSync.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { db } from '@/db/instant'\nimport { useAuth, useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n\n// If a user is signed in with Clerk, sign them in with InstantDB\nexport default function InstantDBAuthSync() {\n  const { isSignedIn } = useUser()\n  const { getToken } = useAuth()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isSignedIn) {\n      getToken()\n        .then((token) => {\n          // Create a long-lived session with Instant for your Clerk user\n          // It will look up the user by email or create a new user with\n          // the email address in the session token.\n          db.auth.signInWithIdToken({\n            clientName: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_CLIENT_NAME as string,\n            idToken: token as string,\n          })\n        })\n        .catch((error) => {\n          console.error('Error signing in with Instant', error)\n        })\n    } else {\n      db.auth.signOut()\n    }\n  }, [isSignedIn])\n\n  return null\n}\nExpand code\n\nIt's important to use this component in your root layout.tsx file because the useEffect() hook that syncs the Clerk and InstantDB sessions needs to run on every page load in order to manage the sessions properly.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\nimport {\n  ClerkProvider,\n  SignInButton,\n  SignUpButton,\n  SignedIn,\n  SignedOut,\n  UserButton,\n} from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\nimport './globals.css'\nimport InstantDBAuthSync from '@/component/InstantDBAuthSync'\n\nconst geistSans = Geist({\n  variable: '--font-geist-sans',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n})\n\nconst geistMono = Geist_Mono({\n  variable: '--font-geist-mono',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n})\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Clerk Next.js Quickstart',\n  description: 'Generated by create next app',\n}\n\nexport default async function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: Readonly<{\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}>) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider>\n      <InstantDBAuthSync />\n      <html lang=\"en\">\n        <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>\n          <header className=\"flex justify-end items-center p-4 gap-4 h-16\">\n            <SignedOut>\n              <SignInButton />\n              <SignUpButton />\n            </SignedOut>\n            <SignedIn>\n              <UserButton />\n            </SignedIn>\n          </header>\n          {children}\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\nExpand code\nUpdate your homepage\n\nUpdate your page.tsx file with the following code to see InstantDB in action.

You can choose whichever authentication strategy and social sign-in providers you prefer. For more information, see the setup guide.\n\nAfter your Clerk application has been created, navigate to the JWT templates⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select New template to create a new template based on Hasura.\n\nOnce the Hasura template is created, you will be redirected to the template's page. You can now configure the template to your needs.\n\nThe Hasura template will pre-populate the default claims required by Hasura. You can include additional claims as necessary. Shortcodes are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.\n\nBy default, Clerk will sign the JWT with a private key automatically generated for your application, which is what most developers use for Hasura. If you so choose, you can customize this key.\n\nConfigure Hasura\n\nThe next step is to provide Hasura with the public keys used to verify the JWT issued by Clerk. Assuming you didn’t use a custom signing key, set the JWKS Endpoint field to the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URL⁠ Clerk automatically created with your Frontend API at https://<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>/.well-known/jwks.json\n\nYou can set up your project either with Hasura Cloud or you can run the Hasura GraphQL engine locally using Docker Compose⁠.\n\nSet up with Hasura Cloud\n\nGo to your project settings, select Env vars, and then add New Env Var.\n\nSet the key to HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET and the value to the following:\n\n{ \"jwk_url\": \"https://{{fapi}}/.well-known/jwks.json\" }\nSet up with Hasura Core\n\nTo add the JWT secret locally with Hasura Core, you need to set both the HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET and HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET in the docker-compose.yml file.\n\nHASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET can be set to any text string.\n\nHASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET should be set to a stringified JSON object of the JWT secret which contains the JWKS Endpoint as the value of jwk_url.\n\nHASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: myadminsecretkey\nHASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET: '{\"jwk_url\":\"https://{{fapi}}/.well-known/jwks.json\"}'\n\nReplace <YOUR_FRONTEND_API> with the Frontend API value. This value can be found on the API keys⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nWith custom signing key\n\nIf you did use a custom signing key, instead of providing the jwk_url you need to provide the algorithm type and key in the stringified JSON object as the HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET in the Hasura Cloud Env Vars or in the docker-compose.yml file.\n\nHASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET: '{\"type\": \"HS256\", \"key\": \"<YOUR_SIGNING_KEY>\" }'\nConfigure your GraphQL client\n\nGraphQL clients (such as Apollo Client⁠ and Relay⁠) can help with querying and caching your data. They can also manage UI state, keep data in sync, and boost performance. GraphQL requests can be to the Hasura backend using different clients.\n\nThe last step of integrating Clerk as the modern web authentication solution for Hasura is to pass the JWT in the Authorization header with your requests. You can access the token generated with the Hasura claims by calling getToken({ template: <your-template-name> }) on the Session object with the name of your template.\n\nEven if you don’t have a database table set up yet, we can make use of the built-in GraphQL introspection system⁠ to validate that the authenticated requests are working properly.\n\nHere is an example of using Apollo Client⁠ in conjunction with the useAuth hook in a Next.js application to make a request to the Hasura GraphQL endpoint:\n\nimport { ApolloProvider, ApolloClient, HttpLink, from, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client'\nimport { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context'\nimport { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport const ApolloProviderWrapper = ({ children }) => {\n  const { getToken } = useAuth()\n  const apolloClient = useMemo(() => {\n    const authMiddleware = setContext(async (req, { headers }) => {\n      const token = await getToken({ template: 'template' })\n      return {\n        headers: {\n          ...headers,\n          authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,\n        },\n      }\n    })\n\n    const httpLink = new HttpLink({\n      uri: process.env.GRAPHQL_URI,\n    })\n\n    return new ApolloClient({\n      link: from([authMiddleware, httpLink]),\n      cache: new InMemoryCache(),\n    })\n  }, [getToken])\n\n  return <ApolloProvider client={apolloClient}>{children}</ApolloProvider>\n}\n\nAs an alternative, here is an example of using Fetch API⁠ in conjunction with the useSWR⁠ hook in a Next.js application to make a request to the Hasura GraphQL endpoint:\n\nimport { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n\n// This component needs to be a child of <ClerkProvider> and <SignedIn>\n// in order to access the authenticated session object\nconst Main = () => {\n  const { getToken } = useAuth()\n  const endpoint = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_GRAPHQL_API\n  const query = `query { __schema { types { name } } }`\n  const fetcher = async (...args) =>\n    fetch(...args, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        Accept: 'application/json',\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${await getToken({ template: 'hasura' })}`,\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ query }),\n    }).then((res) => res.json())\n\n  const { data } = useSWR(endpoint, fetcher)\n\n  return <p>GraphQL schema has {data?.data?.__schema.types.length} types</p>\n}\n\nexport default Main\n\nNote that the getToken({ template: <your-template-name> }) call is asynchronous and returns a Promise that needs to be resolved before accessing the token value. This token is short-lived for better security and should be called before every request to your GraphQL API. The caching and refreshing of the token is handled automatically by Clerk.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This guide will show you how to create a simple blog application that allows users to create and read posts using Prisma Postgres and Clerk. This guide uses Next.js App Router but the same principles can be applied to other SDKs.\n\nInstall Prisma\n\nRun the following command to install Prisma:\n\nterminal\nnpm install prisma tsx --save-dev\nInitialize Prisma\n\nRun the following command to initialize Prisma:\n\nterminal\nnpx prisma init --output ../app/generated/prisma\n\nThis will:\n\nCreate a new prisma/ directory in your project, with a schema.prisma file inside of it. The schema.prisma file is where you will define your database models.\nCreate a prisma.config.ts file in the root of your project.\nUpdate your .env file to include a DATABASE_URL environment variable, which is used to store your database connection string for your Prisma Postgres database.\nUpdate the Prisma configuration\n\nInside the prisma.config.ts file, add import \"dotenv/config\"; so that it can load the DATABASE_URL environment variable from your .env file.\n\nprisma.config.ts\nimport 'dotenv/config'\nimport { defineConfig, env } from 'prisma/config'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  schema: 'prisma/schema.prisma',\n  migrations: {\n    path: 'prisma/migrations',\n  },\n  engine: 'classic',\n  datasource: {\n    url: env('DATABASE_URL'),\n  },\n})\nUpdate the database schema\n\nIn the prisma/schema.prisma file, update the schema to include a new model called Post with the columns id, title, content, published, and authorId. The id column will be used as the post's primary key, and the authorId column will be used to store the user's Clerk ID.\n\nprisma/schema.prisma\ngenerator client {\n  provider = \"prisma-client\"\n  output   = \"../app/generated/prisma\"\n}\n\ndatasource db {\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n}\n\nmodel Post {\n  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\n  title     String\n  content   String?\n  published Boolean @default(false)\n  authorId  String\n}\nPush the schema to the database\n\nRun the following command to push the updated schema to the database:\n\nterminal\nnpx prisma db push\nCreate a reusable Prisma Client instance\n\nAt the root of your project, create a folder called lib. Inside of it, create a new file called prisma.ts and add the following code to it. This will set up a single Prisma Client instance, which is used to interact with your database, and bind it to the global object so that only one instance of the client is created in your application. This helps resolve issues with hot reloading that can occur when using Prisma with Next.js in development mode.\n\nlib/prisma.ts\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient()\n\nconst globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: typeof prisma }\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma\n\nexport default prisma\nCreate the UI for the homepage\n\nNow that all of the set up is complete, it's time to start building out your app.\n\nReplace the contents of app/page.tsx with the following code. This page fetches all posts from your database and displays them on the homepage, showing the title and author ID for each post. It uses the prisma.post.findMany()⁠ method, which is a Prisma Client method that retrieves all records from the database.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport prisma from '@/lib/prisma'\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany() // Query the `Post` model for all posts\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"mx-auto mt-8 flex min-h-screen max-w-2xl flex-col\">\n      <h1 className=\"mb-8 text-4xl font-bold\">Posts</h1>\n\n      <div className=\"mb-8 flex max-w-2xl flex-col space-y-4\">\n        {posts.map((post) => (\n          <Link\n            key={post.id}\n            href={`/posts/${post.id}`}\n            className=\"hover:bg-neutral-100 dark:hover:bg-neutral-800 flex flex-col rounded-lg px-2 py-4 transition-all hover:underline\"\n          >\n            <span className=\"text-lg font-semibold\">{post.title}</span>\n            <span className=\"text-sm\">by {post.authorId}</span>\n          </Link>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n\n      <Link\n        href=\"/posts/create\"\n        className=\"inline-block rounded-lg border-2 border-current px-4 py-2 text-current transition-all hover:scale-[0.98]\"\n      >\n        Create New Post\n      </Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nCreate a new post\n\nCreate a new file called app/posts/create/page.tsx and add the following code to it. This page allows users to create new posts. It uses Clerk's auth object to get the user's ID.\n\nIf there is no user ID, the user is not signed in, so a sign in button is displayed.\nIf the user is signed in, the \"Create New Post\" form is displayed. When the form is submitted, the createPost() function is called.

To get the most out of Supabase with Clerk, you must implement custom Row Level Security⁠ (RLS) policies.\n\nRLS works by validating database queries according to the restrictions defined in the RLS policies applied to the table. This guide will show you how to create RLS policies that restrict access to data based on the user's Clerk ID. This way, users can only access data that belongs to them. To set this up, you will:\n\nCreate a user_id column that defaults to the Clerk user's ID when new records are created.\nCreate policies to restrict what data can be read and inserted.\nUse the Clerk Supabase integration helper in your code to authenticate with Supabase and execute queries.\n\nThis guide will have you create a new table in your Supabase project⁠, but you can apply these concepts to your existing tables as well.\n\nTip\n\nThis integration restricts what data authenticated users can access in the database, but does not synchronize user records between Clerk and Supabase. To send additional data from Clerk to your Supabase database, use webhooks.\n\nSet up Clerk as a Supabase third-party auth provider\n\nFor your Clerk session token to work with Supabase, you need to set up Clerk as a third-party auth provider in Supabase.\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Supabase integration setup⁠.\nSelect your configuration options, and then select Activate Supabase integration. This will reveal the Clerk domain for your Clerk instance.\nSave the Clerk domain.\nIn the Supabase Dashboard, navigate to Authentication > Sign In / Up⁠.\nSelect Add provider and select Clerk from the list of providers.\nPaste the Clerk domain you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.\nSet up RLS policies using Clerk session token data\n\nYou can access Clerk session token data in Supabase using the built-in auth.jwt() function. This is necessary to create custom RLS policies to restrict database access based on the requesting user.\n\nCreate a table to enable RLS on. Open Supabase's SQL editor⁠ and run the following queries. This example creates a tasks table with a user_id column that maps to a Clerk user ID.\n-- Create a \"tasks\" table with a user_id column that maps to a Clerk user ID\ncreate table tasks(\n  id serial primary key,\n  name text not null,\n  user_id text not null default auth.jwt()->>'sub'\n);\n\n-- Enable RLS on the table\nalter table \"tasks\" enable row level security;\nCreate two policies that restrict access to the tasks table based on the requesting user's Clerk ID. These policies allow users to create tasks for themselves and view their own tasks.\ncreate policy \"User can view their own tasks\"\non \"public\".\"tasks\"\nfor select\nto authenticated\nusing (\n((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = (user_id)::text)\n);\n\ncreate policy \"Users must insert their own tasks\"\non \"public\".\"tasks\"\nas permissive\nfor insert\nto authenticated\nwith check (\n((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = (user_id)::text)\n);\nInstall the Supabase client library\n\nRun the following command to add the Supabase client library to your application.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm install @supabase/supabase-js\nSet up your environment variables\nIn the Supabase dashboard, navigate to Project Settings > Data API⁠.\nAdd the Project URL to your .env file as SUPABASE_URL.\nIn the Project API keys section, add the value beside anon public to your .env file as SUPABASE_KEY.\nFetch Supabase data in your code\n\nIn your app's page.tsx, paste the following code. This example shows the list of tasks for the user and allows the user to add new tasks. The createClerkSupabaseClient() function uses Supabase's createClient() method⁠ to initialize a new Supabase client with access to Clerk's session token.\n\nClient-side rendering\nServer-side rendering\n\nThe following example uses the \nNext.js SDK\n to access the \nuseUser()\n and \nuseSession()\n hooks, but you can adapt this code to work with any React-based Clerk SDK.\n\napp/page.tsx\n'use client'\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react'\nimport { useSession, useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<any[]>([])\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n  const [name, setName] = useState('')\n  // The `useUser()` hook is used to ensure that Clerk has loaded data about the signed in user\n  const { user } = useUser()\n  // The `useSession()` hook is used to get the Clerk session object\n  // The session object is used to get the Clerk session token\n  const { session } = useSession()\n\n  // Create a custom Supabase client that injects the Clerk session token into the request headers\n  function createClerkSupabaseClient() {\n    return createClient(\n      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,\n      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY!,\n      {\n        async accessToken() {\n          return session?.getToken() ?? null\n        },\n      },\n    )\n  }\n\n  // Create a `client` object for accessing Supabase data using the Clerk token\n  const client = createClerkSupabaseClient()\n\n  // This `useEffect` will wait for the User object to be loaded before requesting\n  // the tasks for the signed in user\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!user) return\n\n    async function loadTasks() {\n      setLoading(true)\n      const { data, error } = await client.from('tasks').select()\n      if (!error) setTasks(data)\n      setLoading(false)\n    }\n\n    loadTasks()\n  }, [user])\n\n  async function createTask(e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    // Insert task into the \"tasks\" database\n    await client.from('tasks').insert({\n      name,\n    })\n    window.location.reload()\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Tasks</h1>\n\n      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}\n\n      {!loading && tasks.length > 0 && tasks.map((task: any) => <p key={task.id}>{task.name}</p>)}\n\n      {!loading && tasks.length === 0 && <p>No tasks found</p>}\n\n      <form onSubmit={createTask}>\n        <input\n          autoFocus\n          type=\"text\"\n          name=\"name\"\n          placeholder=\"Enter new task\"\n          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}\n          value={name}\n        />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Add</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nExpand code\nTest your integration\n\nRun your project and sign in. Test creating and viewing tasks. Sign out and sign in as a different user, and repeat.\n\nIf you have the same tasks across multiple accounts, double check that RLS is enabled, or that the RLS policies were properly created. Check the table in the Supabase dashboard. You should see all the tasks between both users, but with differing values in the user_id column.\n\nWhat does the Clerk Supabase integration do?\n\nRequests to Supabase's APIs require that authenticated users have a \"role\": \"authenticated\" JWT claim. When enabled, the Clerk Supabase integration adds this claim to your instance's generated session tokens.\n\nSupabase JWT template deprecation\n\nAs of April 1st, 2025, the Clerk Supabase JWT template is considered deprecated. Going forward, the native Supabase integration is the recommended way to integrate Clerk with Supabase. The native integration has a number of benefits over the JWT template:\n\nNo need to fetch a new token for each Supabase request\nNo need to share your Supabase JWT secret key with Clerk\n\nFor more information on the benefits of the native integration, see Supabase's documentation on third-party auth providers⁠.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

The tutorial guides you through setting up a simple application that enables users to add, view, and delete messages using Server Actions and Middleware with Clerk.\n\nCreate a new Next.js project\nCreate a new Next.js project using the following command:\nterminal\nnpx create-next-app clerk-neon-example --typescript --eslint --tailwind --use-npm --no-src-dir --app --import-alias \"@/*\"\nNavigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:\nterminal\ncd clerk-neon-example\nnpm install @neondatabase/serverless\nnpm install drizzle-orm --legacy-peer-deps\nnpm install -D drizzle-kit\nIntegrate the Next.js Clerk SDK\n\nFollow the \nNext.js quickstart\n to integrate the Clerk Next.js SDK into your application.\n\nProtect your application routes\n\nTo ensure that only authenticated users can access your application, modify \nclerkMiddleware\n to require authentication for every route.\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware(async (auth) => {\n  await auth.protect()\n})\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params\n    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',\n    // Always run for API routes\n    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',\n  ],\n}\nSet your neon connection string\n\nAdd the Neon connection string to your project's environment variables. You can find the Neon connection string in the Neon console⁠ - see the Neon docs⁠ for more information.\n\nYour environment variable file should have the following values:\n\n.env\nDATABASE_URL=NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\nCLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY\nSet up the application schema and database connection\n\nInside the app/, create a db/ directory.\n\nCreate a schema.ts file in the db/ directory that defines the database schema. The schema will include a table called user_messages with the columns user_id, create_ts, and message.The user_id column will be used to store the user's Clerk ID.\n\napp/db/schema.ts\nimport { pgTable, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core'\n\nexport const UserMessages = pgTable('user_messages', {\n  user_id: text('user_id').primaryKey().notNull(),\n  createTs: timestamp('create_ts').defaultNow().notNull(),\n  message: text('message').notNull(),\n})\n\nCreate an index.ts file in the db directory to set up the database connection.\n\napp/db/index.ts\nimport { loadEnvConfig } from '@next/env'\nimport { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless'\nimport { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http'\nimport { UserMessages } from './schema'\n\nloadEnvConfig(process.cwd())\n\nif (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {\n  throw new Error('DATABASE_URL must be a Neon postgres connection string')\n}\n\nconst sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL)\nexport const db = drizzle(sql, {\n  schema: { UserMessages },\n})\nPush the schema to the database\n\nTo load the schema into the database, create a drizzle.config.ts file at the root of your project and add the following configuration:\n\ndrizzle.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from 'drizzle-kit'\nimport { loadEnvConfig } from '@next/env'\n\nloadEnvConfig(process.cwd())\n\nif (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {\n  throw new Error('DATABASE_URL must be a Neon postgres connection string')\n}\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  dialect: 'postgresql',\n  dbCredentials: {\n    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\n  },\n  schema: './app/db/schema.ts',\n})\n\nRun the following command to push the schema to the database:\n\nterminal\nnpx drizzle-kit push\nCreate Server Actions to handle user interactions\n\nTo handle form submissions for adding and deleting user messages, create two Server Actions in app/actions.ts.

If a message exists, the user can view and delete it; otherwise, they can add a new message.\n\nTo retrieve the user's messages, use Clerk's \nauth() helper\n to obtain the user's ID. Then, use this ID to query the database for the user's messages.\n\nTo enable the user to delete or add a message, use the deleteUserMessage() and createUserMessage() actions created in the previous step.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { createUserMessage, deleteUserMessage } from './actions'\nimport { db } from './db'\nimport { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default async function Home() {\n  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await auth()\n  if (!isAuthenticated) throw new Error('User not found')\n  const existingMessage = await db.query.UserMessages.findFirst({\n    where: (messages, { eq }) => eq(messages.user_id, userId),\n  })\n\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <h1>Neon + Clerk Example</h1>\n      {existingMessage ?

Clerk offers an official integration⁠ that Vercel users can install to integrate Clerk into their Vercel projects.\n\nInstalling the Clerk Integration\n\nTip\n\nDeploy an example Next.js application and install the Clerk integration with our template.\n\nNavigate to the Clerk integration⁠ in the Vercel Marketplace.\nClick Install to add Clerk to your Vercel team.\nSelect your pricing plan.\nProvide a name for your Clerk application.\nClick Create.\n\nVercel will automatically provision a Clerk account, Organization, and application for you. Vercel calls the provisioned application a Resource.\n\nEach Vercel team has an associated Clerk Organization. When you open the Clerk Dashboard from the Vercel Marketplace, Clerk will automatically provision a new account for you, or link to an existing Clerk account if an account is found with the same email address. An equivalent role in Clerk is assigned to the user based on their Vercel team role. Roles and Vercel team membership are automatically synced to Clerk.\n\nConnecting to your Vercel projects\n\nOnce you've installed and provisioned a Clerk application, you will need to connect it to one of your Vercel projects. Generally, a Clerk application should be connected to a single Vercel project. Clerk will manage multiple instances for you that map to Vercel's environments: Clerk's development instance maps to Vercel's development and preview environments, and the production instance maps to Vercel's production environment.\n\nConnecting to a project will automatically sync your Clerk API keys to your Vercel project's environment variables. The following environment variables will be automatically synced to each environment:\n\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\nCLERK_SECRET_KEY\n\nTip\n\nRunning vercel env pull in your project will automatically sync the development environment variables locally.\n\nConfiguring your Clerk application\n\nMost of your Clerk application configuration will be done through the Clerk Dashboard. To access the Dashboard after installing the Clerk integration, navigate to your installation details page and click the Open in Clerk button.\n\nRefer to the Configuration documentation for more information on configuring your application.\n\nPricing\n\nThe pricing for plans and add-ons purchased through the Vercel Marketplace is the same as the pricing when purchased directly through Clerk. For more information on Clerk's pricing and available plans, see the Pricing page.\n\nBilling and usage data are reported hourly to Vercel and can be viewed directly in the Vercel Dashboard.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe following limitations apply when using Clerk through the Vercel Marketplace:\n\nVercel-managed Organizations cannot be deleted from the Clerk Dashboard, they can only be deleted by uninstalling the Clerk integration.\nVercel-managed Applications cannot be deleted from the Clerk Dashboard, they can only be deleted by uninstalling the Resource from the Vercel Dashboard.\nAdditional Applications cannot be created from the Clerk Dashboard, they must be created from the Vercel Dashboard.\nBilling and plan management is done through the Vercel Dashboard.\nExisting Clerk applications cannot be connected to or moved to be managed by the Clerk Integration.\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Each framework may require a slightly different setup. If you're having trouble getting testing to work properly, contact support⁠.\n\nTest with one time passcodes\n\nTo avoid sending an email or SMS message with a one-time password (OTP)⁠ during testing, you can use a fake email address or phone number that has a fixed code. Read the complete documentation here.\n\nGet a valid session token\n\nWhen writing tests using Clerk, if you need to get a valid session token, use the following flow:\n\nIf you have not already, create a new user⁠.\nCreate a new session⁠ for the user.\nCreate a session token⁠ using the session ID returned in the previous step.\nPass the returned session token as the value of an Authorization header to any other requests you're making, as such: Authorization: Bearer <session_token>.\n\nNote that Clerk's session tokens are short-lived and are valid only for 60 seconds. Read more here.\n\nIf the session token expires, you will need to refresh it with the same create session token endpoint⁠. The most common ways to do this are to either hit this endpoint before every test to ensure you have a valid session token, or to run an interval timer that refreshes the token before it expires.\n\nFor more information, feedback or issues, visit the @clerk/testing⁠ package.\n\nTesting Tokens\n\nTesting Tokens allow you to bypass bot detection mechanisms that protect Clerk applications from malicious bots, ensuring your test suites run smoothly. Without Testing Tokens, you may encounter \"Bot traffic detected\" errors in your requests.\n\nNote\n\nWhile you can manually implement the following logic in your test suite, Clerk provides Playwright and Cypress integrations that handle this automatically.\n\nObtained via the Backend API⁠, Testing Tokens are short-lived and valid only for the specific instance for which they are issued.\n\nOnce retrieved, include the token value in the __clerk_testing_token query parameter in your Frontend API requests. For example, a sign-up request using a Testing Token would look like this:\n\nPOST https://happy-hippo-1.clerk.accounts.dev/v1/client/sign_ups?__clerk_testing_token=1713877200-c_2J2MvPu9PnXcuhbPZNao0LOXqK9A7YrnBn0HmIWxy\nTesting Tokens production limitations\n\nTesting Tokens work in both development and production environments, but there are limitations to be aware of when trying to use Testing Tokens in production.\n\nThe testing helpers do not currently support code-based authentication methods in production environments. Authenticating a user must be done via email and password or by signing in via email address directly.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

For new applications, you cannot enable the integration. However, existing applications with the integration previously enabled will continue to function and can still be configured, but once disabled, it cannot be re-enabled.\n\nAs a workaround, you can implement your own analytics tracking by observing user state changes via Clerk's \nuseUser()\n hook and firing events to your analytics provider. See the FAQ section below for an example.\n\nThis integration enables Clerk to send user authentication events to the configured Google Analytics property which corresponds to your application.\n\nNote\n\nThe Google Analytics integration can be enabled only for Production Instances.\n\nTo enable the integration, you will need to provide Clerk with the required Google Analytics configuration attributes depending on the type of Google Analytics property. We support both Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4 properties.\n\nTo get started, navigate to the Integrations⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Turn on the Google Analytics integration.\n\nOnce enabled, you will be presented with a form to enter the required Google Analytics configuration attributes.\n\nConfiguration\n\nTo allow Clerk to report selected events on your Google Analytics property and improve your user analytics quality, you will need to set some configuration attributes on the integration page.\n\nIntegration type\n\nTo send events to Google Analytics servers, Clerk uses the Measurement Protocol⁠ specification. Depending on your property type, you would need to provide the keys as described below:\n\nGoogle Analytics 4\n\nNote\n\nThe Clerk + Google Analytics integration does not automatically inject any GA tags into your application pages. Any necessary GA tags will need to be set up in your application manually.\n\nAPI Secret: An API secret generated in the Google Analytics UI. To create a new secret, navigate to Admin → Data Streams → choose your stream → Measurement Protocol → Create.\nMeasurement ID: The measurement ID associated with the data stream sending data to your Google Analytics 4 property. The format is G-XXXXXXX and can be found in the Google Analytics UI under Admin → Data Streams → choose your stream → Measurement ID.\nUniversal Analytics\nTracking ID: The tracking ID is a string composed of your account number and the property index and is used to send data to the correct Google Analytics property. The format is UA-YYYYYY-Z and can be found in the Google Analytics UI under Admin → Tracking Info → Tracking Code.\nInclude Clerk user ID\n\nSince Clerk is used for the user management and authentication in your application, we provide the capability to associate the user identifier (UID) generated from Clerk with the User ID feature in Google Analytics. Enabling this feature will allow enhanced user analysis capabilities on Google Analytics like cross-device user tracking, session unification and more.Read more about the User ID feature:\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 User-ID⁠\n\nUniversal Analytics User-ID⁠\n\nEvents to track\n\nSelect during which user authentication events, such as user sign-in or user sign-up, a Google Analytics event should be recorded.\n\nSign-up\n\nSent every time a user signs up for your application through Clerk.\n\nFor Universal Analytics properties, this is sent as a custom event. The custom event is composed as:\n\nCategory: Clerk\nAction: sign_up\nLabel: {{signup method}}\n\nFor Google Analytics 4 properties, this matches the standard sign_up event⁠.\n\nSign-in\n\nSent every time a user signs in to his account through Clerk.\n\nFor Universal Analytics properties, this is sent as a custom event.\n\nCategory: Clerk\nAction: login\nLabel: {{login method}}\n\nFor Google Analytics 4 properties, this matches the standard login event⁠.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWill Clerk events disrupt session attribution, user count or other metrics?\n\nNo, Clerk's production architecture allows us to configure the measurement protocol events sent to your property in such a way that session attribution, user count and identification attributes are kept intact.\n\nI have a new application. Is there a workaround to track authentication events with Google Analytics?\n\nYes. You can implement your own analytics tracking by observing user state changes via Clerk's \nuseUser()\n hook and firing events to your analytics provider.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how you can do this in React by using a useEffect hook that reacts to changes in the User object. When the value is null, the user has signed out; when it's not null, the user is signed in.\n\nsrc/analytics-tracker.tsx\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react'\n\nconst AnalyticsTracker = ({ analytics }) => {\n  const { user } = useUser()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (user) {\n      analytics.track('login', { userId: user.id })\n    } else {\n      analytics.track('logout')\n    }\n  }, [user, analytics])\n\n  return null\n}\n\nexport default AnalyticsTracker\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To confirm that your integration works correctly, you can simulate verification flows without sending an email or SMS, by using reserved values in test mode.\n\nVerification messages are used during sign-up, sign-in, and when adding an email address or phone number to an existing account.\n\nLimitations\n\nIf Clerk is used to deliver SMS messages and/or emails for your development instance, a maximum of 20 SMS messages and 100 emails can be delivered per calendar month.\n\nAfter that, requests resulting in SMS and/or email OTPs⁠ will be rejected. Other SMS or email notifications will still produce a webhook but won't be sent to the target address.\n\nThe following cases do not count toward the limit:\n\nSMS messages sent to US numbers\nSMS messages or emails sent to test numbers/addresses\nSelf-delivered SMS messages or emails (i.e. not delivered by Clerk)\nSMS messages or emails for apps with a paid subscription\n\nIf your development instance requires a higher allowance of monthly SMS messages or emails, contact support to request a limit increase.\n\nSet up test mode\n\nEvery development instance has test mode enabled by default. If you need to use test mode on a production instance, you can enable it in the Clerk Dashboard. However, this is highly discouraged.\n\nTo enable or disable test mode, in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Settings⁠ page.\n\nEmail addresses\n\nAny email with the +clerk_test subaddress is a test email address. No emails will be sent, and they can be verified with the code 424242.\n\nFor example:\n\njane+clerk_test@example.com\n\ndoe+clerk_test@example.com\n\nPhone numbers\n\nAny fictional phone number⁠ is a test phone number. No SMS will be sent, and they can all be verified with the code 424242.\n\nFictional phone numbers have the following structure:\n\n+1 (XXX) 555-0100 to +1 (XXX) 555-0199\n\nFor example:\n\n+12015550100\n\n+19735550133\n\nEmail links\n\nTesting email links in E2E suites is an uphill task. We recommend turning on the Email verification code setting, and using that flow to authenticate your tests. The flows are very similar.\n\nCode examples\nTesting sign in via email code\nconst testSignInWithEmailCode = async () => {\n  const { signIn } = useSignIn()\n\n  const emailAddress = 'john+clerk_test@example.com'\n  const signInResp = await signIn.create({ identifier: emailAddress })\n  const { emailAddressId } = signInResp.supportedFirstFactors.find(\n    (ff) => ff.strategy === 'email_code' && ff.safeIdentifier === emailAddress,\n  )! as EmailCodeFactor\n\n  await signIn.prepareFirstFactor({\n    strategy: 'email_code',\n    emailAddressId: emailAddressId,\n  })\n\n  const attemptResponse = await signIn.attemptFirstFactor({\n    strategy: 'email_code',\n    code: '424242',\n  })\n\n  if (attemptResponse.status == 'complete') {\n    console.log('success')\n  } else {\n    console.log('error')\n  }\n}\nTesting sign up with phone number\nconst testSignUpWithPhoneNumber = async () => {\n  const { signUp } = useSignUp()\n\n  await signUp.create({\n    phoneNumber: '+12015550100',\n  })\n  await signUp.preparePhoneNumberVerification()\n\n  const res = await signUp.attemptPhoneNumberVerification({\n    code: '424242',\n  })\n  if (res.verifications.phoneNumber.status == 'verified') {\n    console.log('success')\n  } else {\n    console.log('error')\n  }\n}\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

For example, if you are using GitHub Actions, refer to Using secrets in GitHub Actions⁠.\n\nGlobal setup\n\nTo set up Clerk with Cypress, call the clerkSetup() function in your cypress.config.ts⁠ file.\n\ncypress.config.ts\nimport { clerkSetup } from '@clerk/testing/cypress'\nimport { defineConfig } from 'cypress'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  e2e: {\n    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {\n      return clerkSetup({ config })\n    },\n    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // your app's URL\n  },\n})\n\nclerkSetup() will retrieve a Testing Token once the test suite starts, making it available for all subsequent tests.\n\nUse Clerk Testing Tokens\n\nNow that Cypress is configured with Clerk, use the setupClerkTestingToken() function in your tests to integrate the Testing Token. See the following example:\n\ntesting-tokens.cy.ts\nimport { setupClerkTestingToken } from '@clerk/testing/cypress'\n\nit('sign up', () => {\n  setupClerkTestingToken()\n\n  cy.visit('/sign-up')\n  // Add any other actions to test\n})\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To use these commands, you must import them in your Cypress E2E support file⁠, as shown in the following example.\n\ncypress/support/e2e.ts\n/// <reference types=\"cypress\" />\nimport { addClerkCommands } from '@clerk/testing/cypress'\naddClerkCommands({ Cypress, cy })\n\nexport {}\ncy.clerkSignIn\n\nThe cy.clerkSignIn command is used to sign in a user using Clerk. This custom command supports only the following first factor⁠ strategies:\n\nPassword\nPhone code\nEmail code\n\nMulti-factor authentication⁠ is not supported.\n\nNote\n\nThis helper internally uses the setupClerkTestingToken() helper, so you don't need to call it separately.\n\nPrerequisites\nBefore calling this command, you must call cy.visit.\nBefore using this command, navigate to a non-protected page that loads Clerk.\nParameters\n\ncy.clerkSignIn accepts an object with the following properties:\n\nName\nstrategy\nType\n'password' | 'phone_code' | 'email_code'\nDescription\n\nThe sign-in strategy. Supported strategies are:\n\npassword: The command will sign in the user using the provided password and identifier.\nphone_code: You must have a user with a test phone number as an identifier (e.g., +15555550100).\nemail_code: You must have a user with a test email as an identifier (e.g., your_email+clerk_test@example.com).\nName\nidentifier\nType\nstring\nDescription\n\nThe user's identifier.

This guide will help you set up your environment for creating authenticated tests with Clerk, assuming you have some familiarity with both Clerk and Playwright.\n\nImportant\n\nSee the demo repo⁠ that demonstrates testing a Clerk-powered application using Testing Tokens. To run the tests, you'll need dev instance Clerk API keys, a test user with username and password, and have username and password authentication enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nInstall @clerk/testing\n\nClerk's testing package provides integration helpers for popular testing frameworks. Run the following command to install it:\n\nnpm\nyarn\npnpm\nterminal\nnpm i @clerk/testing --save-dev\nSet your API keys\n\nIn your test runner, set your Publishable Key⁠ and Secret Key⁠ as the CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY environment variables, respectively.\n\nWarning\n\nEnsure that the Secret Key is provided securely to prevent exposure to third parties. For example, if you are using GitHub Actions, refer to Using secrets in GitHub Actions⁠.\n\nConfigure Playwright with Clerk\n\nThe clerkSetup() function obtains a Testing Token when your test suite starts, making it available for all subsequent tests to use. This ensures that you don't have to manually generate a Testing Token for each test.\n\nTo configure Playwright with Clerk, call the clerkSetup() function in your global setup file⁠, as shown in the following example:\n\nglobal.setup.ts\nimport { clerkSetup } from '@clerk/testing/playwright'\nimport { test as setup } from '@playwright/test'\n\n// Setup must be run serially, this is necessary if Playwright is configured to run fully parallel: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel\nsetup.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })\n\nsetup('global setup', async ({}) => {\n  await clerkSetup()\n})\n\nNote\n\nInstead of calling clerkSetup(), you can manually set the Testing Token by setting the CLERK_TESTING_TOKEN environment variable to the Testing Token that you create through the Backend API.\n\nUse setupClerkTestingToken()\n\nNow that Playwright is configured with Clerk, you can use the setupClerkTestingToken() function to include the Testing Token in individual test cases. This function injects the Testing Token for the specific test, ensuring the test can bypass Clerk's bot detection mechanisms. See the following example:\n\nmy-test.spec.ts\nimport { setupClerkTestingToken } from '@clerk/testing/playwright'\nimport { test } from '@playwright/test'\n\ntest('sign up', async ({ page }) => {\n  await setupClerkTestingToken({ page })\n\n  await page.goto('/sign-up')\n  // Add additional test logic here\n})\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

However, tests can load existing authenticated state.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to save the auth state globally and load it in your test cases, eliminating the need to authenticate in every test and speeding up test execution. Visit the Playwright docs about authentication⁠ for more information.\n\nImportant\n\nSee the demo repo⁠ that demonstrates testing a Clerk-powered application using Testing Tokens. To run the tests, you'll need dev instance Clerk API keys, a test user with username and password, and have username and password authentication enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nCreate a storage directory\n\nCreate a playwright/.clerk directory and add it to your .gitignore. Once the auth state is generated, it will be stored to a file in this directory. Later on, tests will reuse this state and start already authenticated.\n\nterminal\nmkdir -p playwright/.clerk\necho $'\\nplaywright/.clerk' >> .gitignore\nPrepare auth state for your tests\n\nAuthenticate and save the auth state in your global setup file⁠.\n\nThis file:\n\nIs executed before all projects.\nCalls clerkSetup() to configure Playwright with Clerk.\nCalls clerk.signIn() to sign in a test user using credentials stored in environment variables. See the reference for more information about the different parameters you can pass.\nChecks if the user can access a protected page to ensure the user is successfully authenticated.\nStores the auth state in the storage file.\nglobal.setup.ts\nimport { clerk, clerkSetup } from '@clerk/testing/playwright'\nimport { test as setup } from '@playwright/test'\nimport path from 'path'\n\n// Configure Playwright with Clerk\nsetup('global setup', async ({}) => {\n  await clerkSetup()\n})\n\n// Define the path to the storage file, which is `user.json`\nconst authFile = path.join(__dirname, '../playwright/.clerk/user.json')\n\nsetup('authenticate and save state to storage', async ({ page }) => {\n  // Perform authentication steps.\n  // This example uses a Clerk helper to authenticate\n  await page.goto('/')\n  await clerk.signIn({\n    page,\n    signInParams: {\n      strategy: 'password',\n      identifier: process.env.E2E_CLERK_USER_USERNAME!,\n      password: process.env.E2E_CLERK_USER_PASSWORD!,\n    },\n  })\n  await page.goto('/protected')\n  // Ensure the user has successfully accessed the protected page\n  // by checking an element on the page that only the authenticated user can access\n  await page.waitForSelector(\"h1:has-text('This is a PROTECTED page')\")\n\n  await page.context().storageState({ path: authFile })\n})\nLoad the stored auth state in your tests\n\nYou can either load the stored auth state in the config or directly in a test file. Loading in the config is useful if you want to authenticate once and reuse the same auth state for all tests or groups of tests. Loading in a test file is useful if you want to authenticate for a specific test case.\n\nIn the config\n\nIn your playwright.config.ts, create a global setup project and declare it as a dependency⁠ for all your testing projects. This means that the global setup project will always run before all the tests, and because it's where you prepared auth state, it will authenticate before all the tests. All testing projects should use the authenticated state as storageState.\n\nplaywright.config.ts\n// ...\nprojects: [\n  {\n    name: 'global setup',\n    testMatch: /global\\.setup\\.ts/,\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Main tests',\n    testMatch: /.*app.spec.ts/,\n    use: {\n      ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],\n    },\n    dependencies: ['global setup'],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Authenticated tests',\n    testMatch: /.*authenticated.spec.ts/,\n    use: {\n      ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],\n\n      // Use prepared Clerk auth state\n      storageState: 'playwright/.clerk/user.json',\n    },\n    dependencies: ['global setup'],\n  },\n]\nIn a test file\n\nTo use the stored auth state in a test file, see the following example:\n\nauthenticated.spec.ts\nimport { test } from '@playwright/test'\n\n// Use prepared Clerk auth state\ntest.use({ storageState: 'playwright/.clerk/user.json' })\n\ntest('user test', async ({ page }) => {\n  // page is authenticated\n})\n\nFor more information, feedback, or issues, visit the @clerk/testing⁠ package.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Basic testing with these tools is similar, and this guide will help you get started with either option.\n\nGenerate long-lived JWT template\n\nThe standard token issued by Clerk expires after 60 seconds. Clerk SDKs handle refreshing the token regularly so that the authentication state is kept up to date. Because this token expires quickly, it isn't very useful when trying to test with Postman or Insomnia.\n\nYou will want to create a long-lived JWT Template to be used in Postman or Insomnia. To do so, navigate to the JWT templates⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select New template then choose the Blank template.\n\nGive your template a unique name, such as 'testing-template'. Set the Token Lifetime to a value that suits your needs, or use the maximum of 315360000 seconds (10 years). If you added custom claims to the normal session token, then you should add the same claims to your JWT template.\n\nFetch long-lived token\n\nVisit your frontend that is using the same Clerk Application and instance that you want to test. Sign in as a user. The user that you sign in as will be the user you test with in Postman or Insomnia. You can create several tokens for several different users. Once you have signed in, open your Dev Tools and go to the Console tab. Enter the following command:\n\nawait window.Clerk.session.getToken({ template: '<the template name you chose above>' })\nUsing Postman or Insomnia\nPostman\nInsomnia\n\nOpen Postman and create a new request.\n\nConfigure Postman with the method and URL for the API Route you want to test. This example uses the POST method and the /api/protected-route route.\n\nNavigate to the Authorization tab and for token type, select Bearer Token. Paste the token you copied from the console as the Bearer Token. Your request will now authenticate as the user you created the token with.\n\nGrouping requests\n\nPostman and Insomnia both provide a Collections feature, which allows you to group requests together. Inside that collection, you can add Variables⁠ (Postman) or Environment Variables⁠ (Insomnia). These features enable you to use a single token across multiple requests and also allow you to store tokens for multiple users. This is great for testing different features in your application by conveniently changing the token/user you are testing with. You can read more about Postman Variables here⁠ and Insomnia Environment Variables here⁠.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Clerk uses every best practice, and is proactive about monitoring verification email deliverability and speed. Behind the scenes, Clerk uses Sendgrid⁠ using a pool of dedicated IP addresses to ensure that our reputation stays perfect.\n\nIn development instances, all emails are sent from @accounts.dev domain. In production instances, they are sent from your own domain e.g. @example.com.\n\nDuring production instance set up, Clerk will have you set up the required records to configure SPF and DKIM for security and deliverability. It's also recommended to set up DMARC for additional security and deliverability.\n\nBest practices\n\nFollowing the practices below will allow emails to be delivered quickly and reliably:\n\nRefrain from sending any spam from your domain\nSet up an inbox for your domain's \"from\" address\nTry sending email verification codes instead of verification links\nUse Clerk's default emails\nMake sure DMARC is set up\nDeliverability factors\n\nEmail deliverability is made of a number of factors, each contributing to whether or not it will get classified as spam, quarantined, or delayed.\n\nIP address reputation and blocklists\n\nEmail providers check against a pool of IP addresses and domain blocklists to protect against bad actors. Clerk is constantly monitoring to make sure our IP addresses are not on any of these lists. If you're experiencing issues, it may be helpful to verify that your domain doesn't live on any of these lists.\n\nDomain name reputation\n\nEvery domain name (i.e. example.com, clerk.com, etc.) has its own reputation score. Newer domains do not have a high score, and this may impact deliverability.\n\nSetup a real email address\n\nEmail providers will check if there's an actual mailbox behind the \"from address\" of an email. By default, Clerk will send your emails from \nnotifications@your-domain.com\n. You should make sure that you set up a mailbox at this email address. If you'd like to use a different \"from address\", you can change its value via our Backend API⁠.\n\nEmail content\n\nThe email content is scanned by email providers, so this also plays a crucial role in determining if an email clears spam filters. Clerk's default verification email copy is optimized based on trial and error, so, make modifications to the default template at your own risk. However, minor changes are usually ok.\n\nSPF and DKIM email authentication\n\nThese records are set up during production instance initialization and tell email providers which servers and domains are authorized to send emails on behalf of your organization. They also add a digital signature to every outgoing message, which lets providers verify that emails were indeed sent from you. Almost all email providers look for these to be set as a strong signal of legitimacy. Clerk handles these records for you automatically.\n\nEmail traps\n\nBecause a lot of bad actors send spam to large, programmatically generated lists, mailbox providers have set up \"email traps\". If you send to one of these trap email addresses, it will get you flagged, and heavily ding your domain or IP address. Because we only send verification emails, it is very unlikely that Clerk will fall into one of these traps. Out of necessity mailbox providers do not advertise which addresses are \"traps\".\n\nSetup DMARC email authentication\n\nDMARC, or \"Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance\", should also be set up on your domain. If an email ever fails one of the above checks, email providers will act based on the settings you choose here. In order to set up a DMARC policy, you will need to add a TXT record to your domain. The following is an example DMARC policy that Clerk uses for its own emails.\n\nTXT Record\n\nname:\n_dmarc<.example.com>\n\ncontent:\nv=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:you@example.com; ruf=mailto:you@example.com;\n\nThis policy will reject all emails that weren't sent from you. There are other policies⁠ that you can use.\n\nKnown provider-related issues\n\nDespite all precautions, emails still sometimes end up in spam or quarantined. It's worth noting that if you're running into these issues, it's likely not a unique situation. Trying to figure out what is going wrong is a painful process, and some email providers are notoriously opaque and overly aggressive with their spam filters. This is always frustrating, especially when it comes to verification emails. While the following provider-related issues are common, following the steps listed at the top of this document is very likely to get your emails delivered to these inboxes. The two main culprits we've run into are as follows.\n\nGmail\n\nThe most common issue with Clerk's verification emails is that they are \"delayed\" for roughly 4 minutes. This only happens with email addresses that are part of Google Workspace due to their \"pre-delivery message scanning.\"⁠ To further debug email issues with Gmail, you should sign up for Gmail's postmaster tools⁠.\n\nMicrosoft (Hotmail / Outlook / Office365)\n\nMicrosoft Defender's aggressive anti-spam filters are the most common reason that verification emails might not reach certain Outlook inboxes.\n\nIn the event that an email does not reach an Outlook recipient at all, this most likely means they are placed in Quarantine and the workspace's administrator has been able to restore it. If you encounter this issue, try switching to OTP⁠ codes instead of email links, since they tend to have better deliverability with Outlook.\n\nAnother thing you can do is sign up for Sender Support⁠, and make sure you're following all of their best practices.\n\nManaging your own email delivery\n\nIf you would like to handle the delivery of these messages yourself, you can opt out of Clerk's email and SMS delivery on a per-template basis. To do this:\n\nNavigate to the Clerk Dashboard.\nIn the navigation sidenav, select Customization and then select which option you would like to manage: Emails or SMS.\nSelect the template you would like to manage.\nDisable Delivered by Clerk.\n\nNote\n\nThere is currently no way to disable Clerk's email and SMS delivery for all templates at once.\n\nOnce Clerk delivery is disabled, in order to handle the delivery of a email or SMS message, you will need to enable webhooks and listen for the email.created or sms.created events, respectively.\n\nThe event contains both the original message that Clerk would send, in case you would like to use it as-is, or the necessary metadata for you to create messages with your own copywriting. For instance, for a verification code email, the email.created event will contain the otp_code, which you can then use in your own messaging.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Only use it when you need to debug production-specific issues that can't be reproduced in a development environment.\n\nIn rare cases, you may need to debug issues that only occur in your production environment. This guide explains how to configure your local development environment to use production Clerk keys.\n\nPrerequisites\nAccess to your production Clerk API keys⁠\nA production domain already configured in your Clerk Dashboard⁠\nThe ability to run your local server with HTTPS on port 443\nWhy this works\n\nClerk enforces origin validation in production to protect your users. Production keys (pk_live_ and sk_live_) only work with your configured production domain. This means localhost won't work with production keys. You'll see an error like:\n\nClerk: Production Keys are only allowed for domain \"your-domain.com\".\n\nHowever, authentication across subdomains works by default in Clerk production instances. By mapping a subdomain of your production domain to your local machine, you can use production keys locally.\n\nWarning\n\nThis works for troubleshooting many situations, but there are some limitations:\n\nOAuth won't work - Social sign-in providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) have their own redirect URL restrictions. Your local subdomain won't be in their allowed list unless you add it to each provider's configuration.\nWebhooks won't reach localhost - Clerk webhooks can't reach your local machine. Use a tool like Pinggy⁠ or ngrok⁠ if you need to test webhooks.\nSession behavior differs - Production and development instances have different session architectures. Some issues may still not reproduce locally.\nMap a subdomain to localhost\n\nConfigure your machine to resolve a subdomain of your production domain to 127.0.0.1 by editing your hosts file.\n\nReplace your-domain.com with your actual production domain.

The line will be added to your hosts file.\n\nConfigure environment variables\n\nUpdate your .env file to use your production Clerk keys.

When browsers send requests from non-standard ports like 3000, they include the port in the Origin header (e.g., https://local.your-domain.com:3000). Clerk's origin validation fails when the port is included.\n\nProduction Clerk requires HTTPS on port 443. Running on port 443 requires elevated privileges on most systems.\n\nNext.js\nmkcert (any framework)\n\nNext.js 13.5+ can automatically generate a locally-trusted certificate. You'll also need to configure Next.js to allow requests from your subdomain.\n\nAdd the following to your Next.js configuration:\n\nnext.config.js\nconst nextConfig = {\n  allowedDevOrigins: ['local.your-domain.com'],\n  // Other options...\n}\n\nexport default nextConfig\n\nThen start your server on port 443:\n\nterminal\nsudo npx next dev --experimental-https -p 443\n\nNote\n\nThe --experimental-https flag generates a certificate for localhost, not your subdomain. Your browser will show a certificate warning when accessing the subdomain. You can safely proceed past this warning for local debugging, or use mkcert to generate a proper certificate.\n\nTest the configuration\nOpen your browser and navigate to your local subdomain: https://local.your-domain.com\nIf you see a certificate warning, select Advanced and proceed to the site.\nVerify that Clerk loads and you can sign in.\n\nIf you navigate to https://localhost instead, you should see the origin validation error, which confirms that production keys are correctly restricted.\n\nClean up\n\nAfter debugging:\n\nRevert your .env file to use development keys (pk_test_xxxxx and sk_test_xxxxx).\nRemove the allowedDevOrigins configuration from next.config.js (if applicable).\nRemove the entry from your hosts file:\nmacOS\nWindows\nLinux\n\nRun the following command in Terminal, replacing your-domain.com with your actual production domain:\n\nterminal\nsudo sed -i '' '/local\\.your-domain\\.com/d' /etc/hosts\n\nEnter your password if prompted.

Additionally, with large and complex applications, the cause of an error can be traced back to a wide variety of different things, making issues even more difficult to debug. The creation of minimal reproductions is an essential tool in any seasoned developer’s belt for resolving difficult issues, as this process gradually eliminates causes of an issue, narrowing it down to only the root cause.\n\nWhat is a minimal reproduction?\n\nA minimal reproduction is a small test case to demonstrate a problem - often this problem is caused by a bug in the library or user code. Your minimal reproduction should contain the bare minimum code needed to clearly demonstrate that bug.\n\nTemplates\n\nThe best way to create a minimal reproduction is to start fresh, with a minimal functional template. Clerk provides minimal functional templates for each of the frameworks we have SDKs for, which are great starting points:\n\nNext.js App Router⁠\nNext.js Pages Router⁠\nReact⁠\nVanilla JS⁠\nExpo⁠\nRemix⁠\nExpress⁠\nReact Router⁠\nRails⁠\nChrome Extension⁠\nTanStack React Start⁠\nSteps to create a minimal reproduction\nClone a template\n\nClone down one of the templates listed above in order to have the application locally on your machine.\n\nIn the example below, you can see options for cloning the Clerk Next.js App Router⁠ repository.\n\nCreate a Clerk application\n\nCreate a new Clerk application through the Clerk Dashboard. You can follow the setup guide to help you get started.\n\nSet the environment variables\n\nSet the environment variables in your Clerk application. You can find instructions on how to do so in the appropriate quickstart guide.\n\nRun the app\n\nRun the application locally and verify that it’s functional. For example, if you used npm to install the dependencies, you can run the app's development instance with the command npm run dev. The app should then be running on http://localhost:3000 with no errors.\n\nAdd code to reproduce the issue\n\nAdjust your template project by adding code gradually until you get to the point where you are running into the same error.\n\nAdd a README file (optional)\n\nAdd a README file to the root of the repository that contains the steps that must be taken in the app in order to produce the error (select the X button, sign in using Y provider, etc).\n\nWarning\n\nThis step is only required if you are submitting the minimal reproduction to the Clerk support team.\n\nIt’s important throughout this process to be vigilant about removing code that is not necessary to produce the issue. The ideal result is that the repository gets to the state where the exact same issue is able to be produced, with the fewest lines of code possible to get to that point (beyond the baseline included in the templates).\n\nOften times, the process of creating the minimal reproduction will clarify or resolve the original issue. This is great, if it does happen! That is the magic of minimal reproductions.\n\nSubmitting a minimal reproduction\n\nThe Clerk support team requires minimal reproductions in order to start looking into reported bugs or issues for any users or customers that are not on an enterprise plan.\n\nSubmission requirements\n\nBefore submitting a minimal reproduction to the Clerk support team, ensure that the repository:\n\nIs based off one of the templates above and contains a minimal reproduction or has been stripped down to the bare minimum code needed to reproduce the issue\nContains a README file with the steps that must be taken in the app in order to produce the error\nSubmission do's\n\nYou can submit either of these options to the Clerk support team:\n\nA link to a github/bitbucket/gitlab/etc repository.\nA zip file containing a repository.\nSubmission don'ts\n\nWhat is not acceptable to submit to the Clerk support team:\n\nA list of steps that we can take to produce the error\nA pasted error message or error trace\nA link/zip of a full featured app or branch within an app were an error is occurring\nA link to a line in your, or our codebase where an error is presumed to be\nA document containing code blocks that, if combined, describe an app that produces a minimal reproduction\nA link to a repository with a minimal reproduction but no information on how to produce the issue\nA link to a repository with a minimal reproduction that contains a bunch of other third party libraries that are required to produce the issue\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

If you're unable to install the Jam extension, you can generate a HAR file instead.\n\nRecord a browser replay with Jam\n\nJam is a browser extension that allows you to record a replay of your issue with full technical context, including a video recording of your browser along with all network requests. You can create a Jam in Google Chrome and browsers supporting Chrome extensions (such as Microsoft Edge and Brave).\n\nTo learn how to record with Jam, see the Jam documentation⁠.\n\nGenerate a HAR file\n\nIf you're unable to install the Jam extension and record a browser replay, you can generate a HAR file instead. This is only recommended if you're unable to install the Jam extension. Jam recordings are more helpful for debugging as they contain more information than a HAR file.\n\nChrome\nSafari\nFirefox\nOpen the Developer Tools.\nClick Preferences > Network.\nEnable \"Allow to generate HAR (with sensitive data).\"\nGo to the Network tab.\nEnable \"Preserve log\".\nEnsure the record button is red. If not, click it to enable recording.\nReproduce the issue.\nClick the export button and choose \"Export HAR (with sensitive data)\".\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Each OAuth provider has a dedicated guide on how to set up OAuth credentials for Clerk production apps.\nCreate your production instance\nNavigate to the Clerk Dashboard⁠.\nAt the top of the Dashboard, select the Development button to reveal the instance selection dropdown. Select Create production instance.\nYou will be prompted with a modal to either clone your development instance settings to your production instance or create your production instance with Clerk's default settings.\nThe homepage of the dashboard will show you what is still required to deploy your production instance.\n\nWarning\n\nFor security reasons, SSO connections⁠, Integrations⁠, and Paths⁠ settings do not copy over. You will need to set these values again.\n\nAPI keys and environment variables\n\nA common mistake when deploying to production is forgetting to change your API keys to your production instances keys. The best way to set this up is to make use of environment variables. All modern hosting providers, such as Vercel, AWS, GCP, Heroku, and Render, make it easy to add these values. Locally, you should use an .env file. This way, these values are being set dynamically depending on your environment. Here's a list of Clerk variables you'll need to change:\n\nPublishable Key⁠: Formatted as pk_test_ in development and pk_live_ in production. This is passed to the <ClerkProvider> during initialization.\n\nSecret Key⁠: Formatted as sk_test_ in development and sk_live_ in production. These values are used to access Clerk's Backend API.\n\nTip\n\nBe sure to update these values in your hosting provider's environment variables, and also to redeploy your app.\n\nOAuth credentials\n\nIn development, for most social providers, Clerk provides you with a set of shared OAuth credentials.\n\nIn production, these are not secure and you will need to provide your own. Each OAuth provider has a dedicated guide on how to set up OAuth credentials for Clerk production apps.\n\nWebhooks\n\nYour webhook endpoints will need to be updated to use your production instance's URL and signing secret. See the guide on syncing data for more information.\n\nContent Security Policy (CSP)\n\nIf you're using a CSP, follow the instructions in the CSP guide.\n\nDNS records\n\nClerk uses DNS records to provide session management and emails verified from your domain.\n\nTo see what DNS records you need, navigate to the Domains⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nNote\n\nIt can take up to 48hrs for DNS records to fully propagate.\n\nAuthentication across subdomains\n\nWhen you set a root domain for your production deployment, Clerk's authentication will work across all subdomains. User sessions will also be shared across the subdomains.\n\nExamples\n\nexample-site.com and dashboard.example-site.com\ndashboard.example-site.com and accounts.example-site.com\n\nNote\n\nIf you're using passkeys, only the first scenario in the above example will work due to restrictions in the WebAuthn standard⁠.\n\nTo share sessions and authentication across two different domains with the same Clerk application, see the Authentication across different domains guide.\n\nConfigure authorizedParties for secure request authorization\n\nFor enhanced security, it's highly recommended to explicitly set the authorizedParties option when authorizing requests. This option acts as an allowlist of origins to verify against, protecting your application from subdomain cookie leaking attacks. Without this setting, if an app on another subdomain of the same root domain as your Clerk app is compromised, that app could potentially generate valid sessions for your Clerk app.\n\nThe authorizedParties value should include a list of domains allowed to make requests to your application. Omitting this setting can expose your application to CSRF attacks⁠.\n\nExamples\n\nThe following examples show how to set authorizedParties with different Clerk helpers.\n\nSet authorizedParties with clerkMiddleware()\nclerkMiddleware({\n  authorizedParties: ['https://example.com'],\n})\nSet authorizedParties with authenticateRequest()\nclerkClient.authenticateRequest(req, {\n  authorizedParties: ['https://example.com'],\n})\nDeploy certificates\n\nThe Clerk Dashboard home page will tell you what steps are still required to deploy your production instance. Once you have completed all of the necessary steps, a Deploy certificates button will appear. Selecting this button will deploy your production instance.\n\nTroubleshooting\nDNS records not propagating with Cloudflare\n\nClerk uses a DNS check to validate this CNAME record. If this subdomain is reverse proxied behind a service that points to generic hostnames, such as Cloudflare, the DNS check will fail. Set the DNS record for this subdomain to a \"DNS only\" mode on your host to prevent proxying.\n\nDeployment stuck in certificate issuance\n\nIf your instance is stuck during TLS certificate issuance for longer than a few minutes, this might be caused due to certain CAA DNS records⁠ set on your primary domain.\n\nCAA are DNS records you may set to denote which certificate authorities (CA) are permitted to issue certificates for your domain, as a security measure against certain attacks. When you deploy your application, Clerk attempts to provision certificates using either the LetsEncrypt⁠ or Google Trust Services⁠ certificate authorities.\n\nEnsure that your primary domain (e.g., example.com) does not have any CAA records that prevent either LetsEncrypt or Google Trust Services from issuing certificates for your domain. To check this, run the following command in your terminal, replacing example.com with your app’s domain:\n\ndig example.com +short CAA\n\nIf the command returns an empty response, your domain is correctly configured. If it returns any text, you need to remove the CAA records from your primary domain to avoid potential downtime during certificate renewal.\n\nIncorrect domain\n\nIf you accidentally set the wrong domain, you can change it through the Clerk Dashboard or the Backend API.

The CSV can be a custom file or an export from the Clerk Dashboard. The tool respects the backend rate limits and gracefully handles errors. We suggest you customize the Zod schema⁠ to your application's needs.\n\nTo use Clerk's migration tool, clone the repository⁠ and follow the instructions in the README.\n\nMigration strategies\n\nThere are typically two main strategies for migrating your existing user management from a different platform into Clerk:\n\nBasic Export / Import\nTrickle migration\n\nEach of these have trade-offs you'll need to consider for your application and its users.\n\nBasic export/import\n\nWith basic export/import, you're taking an export from your previous tool and importing data into Clerk. The most common way to handle this is by making use of the CreateUser⁠ Backend API endpoint. It's important to note that the CreateUser endpoint is rate limited. For more information, see the guide on rate limits.\n\nYou'll also need to provide your password_hasher value (the hashing algorithm used to generate the password digest) and in some instances Clerk will transparently upgrade your users' password hashes to the more secure Bcrypt hashing algorithm. More details on this topic are available in the Backend API reference docs⁠.\n\nConsiderations\nData consistency\n\nConsider that any export of your data will be a snapshot in time. This means that there is a potential of your data being out of sync at the time of import. To work around this you might script and coordinate the export and import actions to be as close in time as possible, or you might schedule some kind of downtime or maintenance window to complete this action. Be sure to consider Clerk API rate limits when evaluating a potentially time-sensitive migration approach.\n\nActive sessions/session management\n\nAnother consideration is centered around how you handle session management. While most authentication providers don't provide session management out-of-the-box, Clerk does. This means that when you switch over to using Clerk, you'll be changing the system that handles your users' active sessions. This will likely end any currently active sessions initiated by your previous session management service (unless you are able to gracefully handle this somehow within your architecture).\n\nForeign keys\n\nIn your previous system, you likely had some kind of ID/foreign key that you were using. As you migrate data into Clerk, you might want to continue referencing that previous ID alongside Clerk's provided user IDs. While each use case might have some variation, a common strategy is to store previous IDs as an external_id. You can then use Clerk's JWT customization to enrich a userId value with the external_id when present, or fallback to using Clerk's native ID when dealing with new users who don't have an external_id from your legacy system. You can configure this in the Sessions⁠ page in the Clerk Dashboard. Under Customize session token, in the Claims editor, enter the following JSON and select Save. If you have already customized your session token, you may need to merge this with what you currently have.\n\n{\n  \"userId\": \"{{user.external_id || user.id}}\"\n}\nTrickle migration\n\nWith a trickle migration, you are slowly migrating your users from your previous system into Clerk. Depending on your application's needs, this can be a great way to accomplish migration in a gradual and more controlled way. With a trickle migration, you are keeping both systems running for some period of time, handling the transition between systems behind the scenes, and then eventually cutting over fully to Clerk as your user and session management system of record. By handling this transition gradually, you'll maintain more control and put less pressure on a single coordinated event.\n\nConsiderations\nThe cost and overhead of running two systems in parallel\n\nBecause you'll need both systems available when doing a gradual migration, there is naturally additional short-term costs related to having both running systems at the same time.\n\nNote\n\nIt's important to note that Clerk only charges by Monthly Retained Users (MRUs)⁠ and never based on your total number of users in the user table.\n\nFree plans have a limit of 50,000 MRUs per application, and once you exceed this limit you will be required to upgrade to the Pro plan. Head to our pricing page to get the full details on how Clerk charges.\n\nDetermining the appropriate length of time\n\nAs part of the trickle migration, you'll need to determine an appropriate length of time for the migration to take place. For some applications this might be a few weeks, but for others it might be more appropriate to run this for months. Your hard-costs, coordination costs, underlying complexity, and the amount of active users you expect in your migration time-window should guide your decision here.\n\nDealing with inactive users\n\nA trickle migration is great for upgrading active users and sessions to take advantage of Clerk, but there will always be some users who won't create an active session within the migration window and will need to be migrated by other means, typically via basic export/import. A trickle migration lowers coordination risk because the remaining inactive users are fewer, so data de-synchronization risk drops, too.\n\nMigrating from Clerk\n\nThere are two main ways to migrate away from Clerk:\n\nExport your user data from the Clerk Dashboard\nProgrammatically get your user data\nExport your users' data from the Clerk Dashboard\n\nUsers who are either admins or are in their personal workspace can export and download a CSV file containing a list of their application's users that includes their hashed passwords. Users can also view detailed export and download history logs. These logs offer a record of previous export actions, ensuring visibility and traceability of data exports.\n\nTo export your users' data:\n\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the instance's Settings⁠.\nIn the User Exports section, select Export all users.\nA new entry in the export history will appear. Select the Download button to download the CSV file.\nAccess user data in the backend\n\nYou can programmatically retrieve a list of your user's and their information by using the GetUserList⁠ Backend API endpoint, or the JS Backend SDK's getUserList() method which is a wrapper around the Backend API endpoint.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 18, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

This necessitates a password reset flow when migrating users to another platform.\n\nTo eliminate the need for a cumbersome password reset flow, Clerk provides a Cognito password migrator that enables your end users to sign in to Clerk using their existing Cognito passwords.\n\nIn its barest form, it is simply two fields that you set on a Clerk user object through the Backend API⁠.\n\npassword_hasher: awscognito\npassword_digest: awscognito#<COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID>#<COGNITO_CLIENT_ID>#<identifier>\nPre-flight checks\n\nIn AWS, you will need to ensure that your Cognito user pool has a public client with the ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH auth flow enabled.\n\nYou can create a new client for your user pool at any time from the AWS console or through the AWS CLI⁠\n\nCaution\n\nThis step is critical for the migration to work as intended.\n\nOne-time upload\n\nFor any Cognito user object that you’d wish to migrate, you will need to have an equivalent Clerk user object, with the password_hasher and password_digest fields set.\n\nBelow is one method of conducting a batch upload of your Cognito users into Clerk. However, you are not limited to this approach, nor does it impact the migration flow.\n\nEnsure that you are using node >= v20, and run the following to create a new script directory and project.\n\n~\nuser@~: $ mkdir cognito_to_clerk\nuser@~: $ cd cognito_to_clerk\n\nuser@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm init -y\nuser@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm i -E @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider@3.614.0\nuser@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm i -E @clerk/backend@1.4.3\n\nuser@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ touch .env\nuser@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ touch main.ts\n\nFill in the .env file with your AWS and Clerk credentials.\n\nImportant\n\nAlways double check that the CLERK_SECRET_KEY points to the desired Clerk instance (development vs. production)\nThe COGNITO_CLIENT_ID should be the public client ID that you created earlier in the Pre-flight checks section.\n~/cognito_to_clerk/.env\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\nAWS_REGION=\n\nCOGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=\nCOGNITO_CLIENT_ID=\n\nCLERK_SECRET_KEY=\n\nThe provided script below lists your Cognito user pool users, calls CreateUser for each user, and sets the password_hasher and password_digest fields.\n\nCaution\n\nRate limits apply to the CreateUser⁠ endpoint. For development instances, a rate limit rule of 100 requests per 10 seconds is applied. For production instances, that limit goes up to 1000 requests per 10 seconds.\n\n~/cognito_to_clerk/main.ts\nimport { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'\nimport * as IDP from '@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider'\n\n// NOTE: The IAM user should have permissions roughly equivalent to AmazonCognitoReadOnly.\n// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonCognitoReadOnly.html\nconst { AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION } = process.env\nif (!AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || !AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || !AWS_REGION) {\n  throw new Error(\n    'AWS credentials are required.

This page walks through integration options, prebuilt components, configuration steps, and the key objects you'll use as you build your application.\n\nWays to implement Clerk\n\nClerk provides three ways to integrate authentication into your application, depending on the level of control and customization you need:\n\nAccount Portal (default): Uses Clerk's prebuilt components on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers. Every Clerk application has this enabled by default, providing a complete user management interface out of the box.\nPrebuilt components\n: All-in-one UI components that can be integrated into your application. They are fully customizable to match your application's branding and design. This is the recommended approach for most use cases.\nCustom flows⁠ using the Clerk API: Build your own UI using the Clerk API. This option provides maximum flexibility and control over the user experience but requires more development effort.\n\nClerk offers a comprehensive suite of prebuilt components designed to seamlessly integrate authentication and multi-tenancy into your application. Components, like <SignIn />, <UserButton />, and <OrganizationSwitcher />, are all-in-one solutions that handle the full lifecycle of the user experience, from sign-up/sign-in to user profile and Organization management.\n\nThe Account Portal uses these components on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers. These pages cannot be customized beyond the options provided in the Clerk Dashboard⁠.\n\nFor more control and customization, you can migrate away from the Account Portal and embed the prebuilt components directly into your own application pages. While they are \nfully customizable\n to match your application's branding and design using CSS or special props, the HTML structure and the logic/ordering of the authentication flow remain fixed.\n\nIf the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you need complete control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. However, this is more advanced and it's recommended to use the prebuilt components whenever possible.\n\nTip\n\nMost applications usually progress from the Account Portal to prebuilt components as they grow, with custom flows used for advanced cases.\n\nConfiguring your application\n\nConfiguring your application is done through the Clerk Dashboard⁠. The Clerk Dashboard is where you, as the application owner, can manage your application's settings, users, and organizations.\n\nFor example, you can:\n\nEnable phone number authentication or multi-factor authentication.\nAdd social providers like Google.\nDelete users or create Organizations.\nInvite other users to your workspace to help configure and manage your application.\n\nTo get started, see the configuration docs, which include dedicated guides for specific configuration options.\n\nBuilding your application\nSession token\n\nWhen a user is authenticated in your application, Clerk generates a short-lived session token that you can use to authenticate requests to your backend. This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains information about the user and their session.\n\nRead more about Clerk session tokens and how they work in the guide on how Clerk works.\n\nKey Clerk objects\n\nThe Clerk JavaScript SDK, or ClerkJS, is where Clerk all started. It is the core SDK that powers all other JavaScript SDKs, including React and Next.js. As you build, you'll likely interact with the following objects.\n\nClerk\n\nThe Clerk class is the main entry point for the Clerk JavaScript SDK. All other objects are accessible from the Clerk object. As you're building your application, you'll likely interact with these objects, either directly or through helpers provided by the other SDKs, like React hooks or Vue composables.\n\nClient\n\nA client represents the current device or software accessing an application such as your web browser, native application, or Chrome Extension. It is represented by the Client object.\n\nSession\n\nA session is a secure representation of the authentication state of the current user. Each client can hold multiple sessions on the same device. It is represented by the Session object.\n\nUser\n\nThe User object represents the current user of the session. It holds all the basic user information such as the user's name, email addresses, and phone numbers, and including their public, private, and unsafe metadata.\n\nOrganization\n\nOrganizations are a flexible and scalable way to manage users and their access to resources within your Clerk application. With Organizations, you can assign specific Roles and Permissions to users, making them useful for managing projects, coordinating teams, or facilitating partnerships.\n\nUsers can belong to many Organizations. One of them will be the Active Organization⁠ of the session. It is represented by the Organization object. To learn about Organizations, see the dedicated guide.\n\nSign in\n\nThe SignIn object holds the state of the current sign-in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-in process. It is used to manage the sign-in lifecycle, including the first⁠ and second⁠ factor verification, and the creation of a new session.\n\nSign up\n\nThe SignUp object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.\n\nDeep dive\n\nFor a deeper dive into how Clerk works, like how our authentication model works, see the dedicated guide.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

If you would like to create an application using the React Router framework, see the \nReact Router quickstart\n.\n\nCreate a new React app\n\nIf you don't already have a React app, run the following commands to create a new one using Vite⁠.\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm create vite@latest clerk-react -- --template react-ts\ncd clerk-react\nnpm install\nInstall @clerk/clerk-react\n\nThe \nClerk React SDK\n gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.\n\nRun the following command to install the SDK:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm install @clerk/clerk-react\nSet your Clerk API keys\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the API keys⁠ page.\nIn the Quick Copy section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key⁠.\nPaste your key into your .env file.\n\nThe final result should resemble the following:\n\n.env\nVITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\nImport the Clerk Publishable Key\n\nIn your main.tsx file, import your Clerk Publishable Key⁠. You can add an if statement to check that it is imported and that it exists. This will prevent running the app without the Publishable Key, and will also prevent TypeScript errors.\n\nsrc/main.tsx\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'\nimport './index.css'\nimport App from './App.tsx'\n\n// Import your Publishable Key\nconst PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\n\nif (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {\n  throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')\n}\n\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>,\n)\nAdd <ClerkProvider> to your app\n\nThe \n<ClerkProvider>\n component provides session and user context to Clerk's hooks and components. It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with <ClerkProvider> to make authentication globally accessible. See the \nreference docs\n for other configuration options.\n\nPass your Publishable Key⁠ as a prop to the component, as shown in the following example:\n\nsrc/main.tsx\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'\nimport './index.css'\nimport App from './App.tsx'\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'\n\n// Import your Publishable Key\nconst PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\n\nif (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {\n  throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')\n}\n\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>\n      <App />\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  </StrictMode>,\n)\nCreate a header with Clerk components\n\nYou can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with the \nprebuilt control components\n. The following example creates a header using the following components:\n\n<SignedIn>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed in.\n<SignedOut>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed out.\n<UserButton />\n: Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.\n<SignInButton />\n: An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or environment variables are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the Account Portal sign-in page.\n<SignUpButton />\n: An unstyled component that links to the sign-up page. In this example, since no props or environment variables are set for the sign-up URL, this component links to the Account Portal sign-up page.\nsrc/App.tsx\nimport './App.css'\nimport { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, SignUpButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <header>\n        {/* Show the sign-in and sign-up buttons when the user is signed out */}\n        <SignedOut>\n          <SignInButton />\n          <SignUpButton />\n        </SignedOut>\n        {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}\n        <SignedIn>\n          <UserButton />\n        </SignedIn>\n      </header>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\nRun your project\n\nRun your project with the following command:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm run dev\nCreate your first user\nVisit your app's homepage at http://localhost:5173⁠.\nSelect \"Sign up\" on the page and authenticate to create your first user.\nNext steps\n\nLearn more about Clerk components, how to customize them, and how to use Clerk's client-side helpers using the following guides.\n\nPrebuilt components\n\nLearn how to quickly add authentication to your app using Clerk's suite of components.\n\nCustomization & localization\n\nLearn how to customize and localize Clerk components.\n\nClient-side helpers (hooks)\n\nLearn more about Clerk's client-side helpers and how to use them.\n\nDeclarative mode\n\nLearn how to use Clerk with React Router in declarative mode to add authentication to your app.\n\nGet started with Organizations\n\nLearn how to create and manage Organizations in your React app.\n\nClerk React SDK Reference\n\nLearn about the Clerk React SDK and how to integrate it into your app.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To add clerkMiddleware() to your app, follow these steps:\n\nImportant\n\nIf you're using Next.js ≤15, name your file middleware.ts instead of proxy.ts. The code itself remains the same; only the filename changes.\n\nCreate a proxy.ts file.\n\nIf you're using the /src directory, create proxy.ts in the /src directory.\nIf you're not using the /src directory, create proxy.ts in the root directory.\n\nIn your proxy.ts file, export the clerkMiddleware() helper:\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware()\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params\n    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',\n    // Always run for API routes\n    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',\n  ],\n}\n\nBy default, clerkMiddleware() will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the \nclerkMiddleware() reference\n to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.\n\nAdd <ClerkProvider> to your app\n\nThe \n<ClerkProvider>\n component provides session and user context to Clerk's hooks and components. It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with <ClerkProvider> to make authentication globally accessible. See the \nreference docs\n for other configuration options.\n\nAdd the <ClerkProvider> component to your app's layout, as shown in the following example:\n\napp/layout.tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\nimport './globals.css'\n\n\n14 lines collapsed\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: Readonly<{\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}>) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider>\n      <html lang=\"en\">\n        <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>\n          {children}\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\nCreate a header with Clerk components\n\nYou can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with the \nprebuilt control components\n. The following example creates a header using the following components:\n\n<SignedIn>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed in.\n<SignedOut>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed out.\n<UserButton />\n: Shows the signed-in user's avatar.

This page walks through integration options, prebuilt components, configuration steps, and the key objects you'll use as you build your application.\n\nWays to implement Clerk\n\nClerk provides three ways to integrate authentication into your application, depending on the level of control and customization you need:\n\nAccount Portal (default): Uses Clerk's prebuilt components on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers. Every Clerk application has this enabled by default, providing a complete user management interface out of the box.\nPrebuilt components\n: All-in-one UI components that can be integrated into your application. They are fully customizable to match your application's branding and design. This is the recommended approach for most use cases.\nCustom flows⁠ using the Clerk API: Build your own UI using the Clerk API. This option provides maximum flexibility and control over the user experience but requires more development effort.\n\nClerk offers a comprehensive suite of prebuilt components designed to seamlessly integrate authentication and multi-tenancy into your application. Components, like <SignIn />, <UserButton />, and <OrganizationSwitcher />, are all-in-one solutions that handle the full lifecycle of the user experience, from sign-up/sign-in to user profile and Organization management.\n\nThe Account Portal uses these components on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers. These pages cannot be customized beyond the options provided in the Clerk Dashboard⁠.\n\nFor more control and customization, you can migrate away from the Account Portal and embed the prebuilt components directly into your own application pages. While they are \nfully customizable\n to match your application's branding and design using CSS or special props, the HTML structure and the logic/ordering of the authentication flow remain fixed.\n\nIf the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you need complete control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. However, this is more advanced and it's recommended to use the prebuilt components whenever possible.\n\nTip\n\nMost applications usually progress from the Account Portal to prebuilt components as they grow, with custom flows used for advanced cases.\n\nConfiguring your application\n\nConfiguring your application is done through the Clerk Dashboard⁠. The Clerk Dashboard is where you, as the application owner, can manage your application's settings, users, and organizations.\n\nFor example, you can:\n\nEnable phone number authentication or multi-factor authentication.\nAdd social providers like Google.\nDelete users or create Organizations.\nInvite other users to your workspace to help configure and manage your application.\n\nTo get started, see the configuration docs, which include dedicated guides for specific configuration options.\n\nBuilding your application\nSession token\n\nWhen a user is authenticated in your application, Clerk generates a short-lived session token that you can use to authenticate requests to your backend. This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains information about the user and their session.\n\nRead more about Clerk session tokens and how they work in the guide on how Clerk works.\n\nKey Clerk objects\n\nThe Clerk JavaScript SDK, or ClerkJS, is where Clerk all started. It is the core SDK that powers all other JavaScript SDKs, including React and Next.js. As you build, you'll likely interact with the following objects.\n\nClerk\n\nThe Clerk class is the main entry point for the Clerk JavaScript SDK. All other objects are accessible from the Clerk object. As you're building your application, you'll likely interact with these objects, either directly or through helpers provided by the other SDKs, like React hooks or Vue composables.\n\nClient\n\nA client represents the current device or software accessing an application such as your web browser, native application, or Chrome Extension. It is represented by the Client object.\n\nSession\n\nA session is a secure representation of the authentication state of the current user. Each client can hold multiple sessions on the same device. It is represented by the Session object.\n\nUser\n\nThe User object represents the current user of the session. It holds all the basic user information such as the user's name, email addresses, and phone numbers, and including their public, private, and unsafe metadata.\n\nOrganization\n\nOrganizations are a flexible and scalable way to manage users and their access to resources within your Clerk application. With Organizations, you can assign specific Roles and Permissions to users, making them useful for managing projects, coordinating teams, or facilitating partnerships.\n\nUsers can belong to many Organizations. One of them will be the Active Organization⁠ of the session. It is represented by the Organization object. To learn about Organizations, see the dedicated guide.\n\nSign in\n\nThe SignIn object holds the state of the current sign-in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-in process. It is used to manage the sign-in lifecycle, including the first⁠ and second⁠ factor verification, and the creation of a new session.\n\nSign up\n\nThe SignUp object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.\n\nDeep dive\n\nFor a deeper dive into how Clerk works, like how our authentication model works, see the dedicated guide.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

To add clerkMiddleware() to your app, follow these steps:\n\nImportant\n\nIf you're using Next.js ≤15, name your file middleware.ts instead of proxy.ts. The code itself remains the same; only the filename changes.\n\nCreate a proxy.ts file.\n\nIf you're using the /src directory, create proxy.ts in the /src directory.\nIf you're not using the /src directory, create proxy.ts in the root directory alongside .env.\n\nIn your proxy.ts file, export the clerkMiddleware() helper:\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware()\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params\n    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',\n    // Always run for API routes\n    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',\n  ],\n}\n\nBy default, clerkMiddleware() will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the \nclerkMiddleware() reference\n to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.\n\nAdd <ClerkProvider> to your app\n\nThe \n<ClerkProvider>\n component provides session and user context to Clerk's hooks and components. It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with <ClerkProvider> to make authentication globally accessible. See the \nreference docs\n for other configuration options.\n\nAdd the <ClerkProvider> component to your app, as shown in the following example:\n\npages/_app.tsx\nimport '@/styles/globals.css'\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      {...pageProps}\n      appearance={{\n        cssLayerName: 'clerk',\n      }}\n    >\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\nUpdate globals.css\n\nIn the previous step, the cssLayerName property is set on the <ClerkProvider> component. Now, you need to add the following line to the top of your globals.css file in order to include the layer you named in the cssLayerName property. The example names the layer clerk but you can name it anything you want. These steps are necessary for v4 of Tailwind as it ensures that Tailwind's utility styles are applied after Clerk's styles.\n\nglobals.css\n+ @layer theme, base, clerk, components, utilities;\n  @import 'tailwindcss';\nCreate a header with Clerk components\n\nYou can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with the \nprebuilt control components\n. The following example creates a header using the following components:\n\n<SignedIn>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed in.\n<SignedOut>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed out.\n<UserButton />\n: Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.\n<SignInButton />\n: An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or environment variables are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the Account Portal sign-in page.\n<SignUpButton />\n: An unstyled component that links to the sign-up page. In this example, since no props or environment variables are set for the sign-up URL, this component links to the Account Portal sign-up page.\npages/_app.tsx\nimport '@/styles/globals.css'\nimport {\n  ClerkProvider,\n  SignInButton,\n  SignUpButton,\n  SignedIn,\n  SignedOut,\n  UserButton,\n} from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      {...pageProps}\n      appearance={{\n        cssLayerName: 'clerk',\n      }}\n    >\n      <header className=\"flex justify-end items-center p-4 gap-4 h-16\">\n        {/* Show the sign-in and sign-up buttons when the user is signed out */}\n        <SignedOut>\n          <SignInButton />\n          <SignUpButton>\n            <button className=\"bg-[#6c47ff] text-white rounded-full font-medium text-sm sm:text-base h-10 sm:h-12 px-4 sm:px-5 cursor-pointer\">\n              Sign Up\n            </button>\n          </SignUpButton>\n        </SignedOut>\n        {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}\n        <SignedIn>\n          <UserButton />\n        </SignedIn>\n      </header>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\nRun your project\n\nRun your project with the following command:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm run dev\nCreate your first user\nVisit your app's homepage at http://localhost:3000⁠.\nSelect \"Sign up\" on the page and authenticate to create your first user.\nNext steps\n\nLearn more about Clerk components, how to customize them, and how to build custom authentication flows using the following guides.\n\nPrebuilt components\n\nLearn how to quickly add authentication to your app using Clerk's suite of components.\n\nCustomization & localization\n\nLearn how to customize and localize Clerk components.\n\nCreate a custom sign-in-or-up page\n\nLearn how to create a custom sign-in-or-up page with Clerk components.\n\nProtect content and read user data\n\nLearn how to use Clerk's hooks and helpers to protect content and read user data in your Next.js app.\n\nGet started with Organizations\n\nLearn how to create and manage Organizations in your Next.js app.\n\nClerk Next.js SDK Reference\n\nLearn about the Clerk Next.js SDK and how to integrate it into your app.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with <ClerkProvider> to make authentication globally accessible. See the \nreference docs\n for other configuration options.\n\nAdd the component to your root layout, as shown in the following example:\n\napp/_layout.tsx\n  import { useColorScheme } from '@/hooks/use-color-scheme'\n+ import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'\n  import { DarkTheme, DefaultTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@react-navigation/native'\n  import { Stack } from 'expo-router'\n  import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'\n  import 'react-native-reanimated'\n  \n  export const unstable_settings = {\n    anchor: '(tabs)',\n  }\n  \n  export default function RootLayout() {\n    const colorScheme = useColorScheme()\n  \n    return (\n      <ThemeProvider value={colorScheme === 'dark' ? DarkTheme : DefaultTheme}>\n+       <ClerkProvider>\n          <Stack>\n            <Stack.Screen name=\"(tabs)\" options={{ headerShown: false }} />\n            <Stack.Screen name=\"modal\" options={{ presentation: 'modal', title: 'Modal' }} />\n          </Stack>\n          <StatusBar style=\"auto\" />\n+       </ClerkProvider>\n      </ThemeProvider>\n    )\n  }\nConfigure the token cache\n\nClerk stores the active user's session token in memory by default. In Expo apps, the recommended way to store sensitive data, such as tokens, is by using expo-secure-store which encrypts the data before storing it.\n\nTo use expo-secure-store as your token cache:\n\nRun the following command to install the library:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm install expo-secure-store\n\nUpdate your root layout to use the secure token cache:\n\napp/_layout.tsx\n  import { useColorScheme } from '@/hooks/use-color-scheme'\n  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'\n+ import { tokenCache } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/token-cache'\n  import { DarkTheme, DefaultTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@react-navigation/native'\n  import { Stack } from 'expo-router'\n  import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'\n  import 'react-native-reanimated'\n  \n  export const unstable_settings = {\n    anchor: '(tabs)',\n  }\n  \n  export default function RootLayout() {\n    const colorScheme = useColorScheme()\n  \n    return (\n      <ThemeProvider value={colorScheme === 'dark' ? DarkTheme : DefaultTheme}>\n+       <ClerkProvider tokenCache={tokenCache}>\n          <Stack>\n            <Stack.Screen name=\"(tabs)\" options={{ headerShown: false }} />\n            <Stack.Screen name=\"modal\" options={{ presentation: 'modal', title: 'Modal' }} />\n          </Stack>\n          <StatusBar style=\"auto\" />\n        </ClerkProvider>\n      </ThemeProvider>\n    )\n  }\n\nTip\n\nWhen you sign a user out with \nsignOut()\n, Clerk will remove the user's session JWT from the token cache.\n\nAdd sign-up and sign-in pages\n\nClerk currently only supports \ncontrol components\n for Expo native. UI components are only available for Expo web. Instead, you must build custom flows⁠ using Clerk's API. The following sections demonstrate how to build custom email/password sign-up and sign-in flows. If you want to use different authentication methods, such as passwordless or OAuth, see the dedicated custom flow guides.\n\nLayout page\n\nFirst, protect your sign-up and sign-in pages.\n\nCreate an (auth) route group⁠. This will group your sign-up and sign-in pages.\nIn the (auth) group, create a _layout.tsx file with the following code. The \nuseAuth()\n hook is used to access the user's authentication state. If the user is already signed in, they will be redirected to the home page.\napp/(auth)/_layout.tsx\nimport { Redirect, Stack } from 'expo-router'\nimport { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'\n\nexport default function AuthRoutesLayout() {\n  const { isSignedIn } = useAuth()\n\n  if (isSignedIn) {\n    return <Redirect href={'/'} />\n  }\n\n  return <Stack />\n}\nSign-up page\n\nIn the (auth) group, create a sign-up.tsx file with the following code.

This page walks through integration options, prebuilt components, configuration steps, and the key objects you'll use as you build your application.\n\nWays to implement Clerk\n\nClerk provides three ways to integrate authentication into your application, depending on the level of control and customization you need:\n\nAccount Portal (default): Uses Clerk's prebuilt components on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers. Every Clerk application has this enabled by default, providing a complete user management interface out of the box.\nPrebuilt components\n: All-in-one UI components that can be integrated into your application. They are fully customizable to match your application's branding and design. This is the recommended approach for most use cases.\nCustom flows⁠ using the Clerk API: Build your own UI using the Clerk API. This option provides maximum flexibility and control over the user experience but requires more development effort.\n\nClerk offers a comprehensive suite of prebuilt components designed to seamlessly integrate authentication and multi-tenancy into your application. Components, like <SignIn />, <UserButton />, and <OrganizationSwitcher />, are all-in-one solutions that handle the full lifecycle of the user experience, from sign-up/sign-in to user profile and Organization management.\n\nThe Account Portal uses these components on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers. These pages cannot be customized beyond the options provided in the Clerk Dashboard⁠.\n\nFor more control and customization, you can migrate away from the Account Portal and embed the prebuilt components directly into your own application pages. While they are \nfully customizable\n to match your application's branding and design using CSS or special props, the HTML structure and the logic/ordering of the authentication flow remain fixed.\n\nIf the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you need complete control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. However, this is more advanced and it's recommended to use the prebuilt components whenever possible.\n\nTip\n\nMost applications usually progress from the Account Portal to prebuilt components as they grow, with custom flows used for advanced cases.\n\nConfiguring your application\n\nConfiguring your application is done through the Clerk Dashboard⁠. The Clerk Dashboard is where you, as the application owner, can manage your application's settings, users, and organizations.\n\nFor example, you can:\n\nEnable phone number authentication or multi-factor authentication.\nAdd social providers like Google.\nDelete users or create Organizations.\nInvite other users to your workspace to help configure and manage your application.\n\nTo get started, see the configuration docs, which include dedicated guides for specific configuration options.\n\nBuilding your application\nSession token\n\nWhen a user is authenticated in your application, Clerk generates a short-lived session token that you can use to authenticate requests to your backend. This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains information about the user and their session.\n\nRead more about Clerk session tokens and how they work in the guide on how Clerk works.\n\nKey Clerk objects\n\nThe Clerk JavaScript SDK, or ClerkJS, is where Clerk all started. It is the core SDK that powers all other JavaScript SDKs, including React and Next.js. As you build, you'll likely interact with the following objects.\n\nClerk\n\nThe Clerk class is the main entry point for the Clerk JavaScript SDK. All other objects are accessible from the Clerk object. As you're building your application, you'll likely interact with these objects, either directly or through helpers provided by the other SDKs, like React hooks or Vue composables.\n\nClient\n\nA client represents the current device or software accessing an application such as your web browser, native application, or Chrome Extension. It is represented by the Client object.\n\nSession\n\nA session is a secure representation of the authentication state of the current user. Each client can hold multiple sessions on the same device. It is represented by the Session object.\n\nUser\n\nThe User object represents the current user of the session. It holds all the basic user information such as the user's name, email addresses, and phone numbers, and including their public, private, and unsafe metadata.\n\nOrganization\n\nOrganizations are a flexible and scalable way to manage users and their access to resources within your Clerk application. With Organizations, you can assign specific Roles and Permissions to users, making them useful for managing projects, coordinating teams, or facilitating partnerships.\n\nUsers can belong to many Organizations. One of them will be the Active Organization⁠ of the session. It is represented by the Organization object. To learn about Organizations, see the dedicated guide.\n\nSign in\n\nThe SignIn object holds the state of the current sign-in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-in process. It is used to manage the sign-in lifecycle, including the first⁠ and second⁠ factor verification, and the creation of a new session.\n\nSign up\n\nThe SignUp object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.\n\nDeep dive\n\nFor a deeper dive into how Clerk works, like how our authentication model works, see the dedicated guide.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

Run the following command to install it:\n\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nbun\nterminal\nnpm install dotenv\nAdd clerkMiddleware() to your app\n\nThe clerkMiddleware() function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and, if found, attaches the \nAuth\n object to the request object under the auth key.\n\nindex.ts\nimport 'dotenv/config'\nimport express from 'express'\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'\n\nconst app = express()\nconst PORT = 3000\n\napp.use(clerkMiddleware())\n\n// Start the server and listen on the specified port\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)\n})\nProtect your routes using requireAuth()\n\nTo protect your routes, use the requireAuth() middleware. This middleware functions similarly to clerkMiddleware(), but also protects your routes by redirecting unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.\n\nIn the following example, requireAuth() is used to protect the /protected route. If the user isn't authenticated, they're redirected to the homepage. If the user is authenticated, the getAuth() function is used to get the userId, which is passed to \nclerkClient.users.getUser()\n to fetch the current user's User object.\n\nindex.ts\nimport 'dotenv/config'\nimport express from 'express'\nimport { clerkMiddleware, clerkClient, requireAuth, getAuth } from '@clerk/express'\n\nconst app = express()\nconst PORT = 3000\n\napp.use(clerkMiddleware())\n\n// Use requireAuth() to protect this route\n// If user isn't authenticated, requireAuth() will redirect back to the homepage\napp.get('/protected', requireAuth(), async (req, res) => {\n  // Use `getAuth()` to get the user's `userId`\n  const { userId } = getAuth(req)\n\n  // Use Clerk's JS Backend SDK to get the user's User object\n  const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)\n\n  return res.json({ user })\n})\n\n// Start the server and listen on the specified port\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)\n})\nAdd global TypeScript type (optional)\n\nIf you're using TypeScript, add a global type reference to your project to enable auto-completion and type checking for the auth object in Express request handlers.\n\nIn your application's root folder, create a types/ directory.\nInside this directory, create a globals.d.ts file with the following code.\ntypes/globals.d.ts\n/// <reference types=\"@clerk/express/env\" />\nNext steps\n\nLearn how to protect routes, handle authentication and authorization, and prepare your Clerk app for production using the following guides.\n\nProtect routes using requireAuth()\n\nLearn how to protect specific routes from unauthenticated users.\n\nProtect routes based on authorization status\n\nLearn how to protect a route based on both authentication and authorization status.\n\nDeploy to production\n\nLearn how to deploy your Clerk app to production.\n\nClerk Express SDK reference\n\nLearn about the Clerk Express SDK and how to integrate it into your app.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",

It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with <ClerkProvider> to make authentication globally accessible. See the \nreference docs\n for other configuration options.\n\nsrc/popup.tsx\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/chrome-extension'\n\nimport { CountButton } from '~features/count-button'\n\nimport '~style.css'\n\nconst PUBLISHABLE_KEY = process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\n\nif (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {\n  throw new Error('Please add the PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to the .env.development file')\n}\n\nfunction IndexPopup() {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>\n      <div className=\"plasmo-flex plasmo-items-center plasmo-justify-center plasmo-h-16 plasmo-w-40\">\n        <CountButton />\n      </div>\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default IndexPopup\nCreate a header with Clerk components\n\nYou can control what content signed in and signed out users can see with Clerk's \nprebuilt components\n. Create a header with the following Clerk components. (With Chrome Extensions, you can also add this logic to a footer).\n\n<SignedIn>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed in.\n<SignedOut>\n: Children of this component can only be seen while signed out.\n<UserButton />\n: Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.\n<SignInButton />\n: An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or environment variables are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the Account Portal sign-in page.\n<SignUpButton />\n: An unstyled component that links to the sign-up page. In this example, since no props or environment variables are set for the sign-up URL, this component links to the Account Portal sign-up page.\nsrc/popup.tsx\nimport {\n  ClerkProvider,\n  SignInButton,\n  SignUpButton,\n  SignedIn,\n  SignedOut,\n  UserButton,\n} from '@clerk/chrome-extension'\nimport { CountButton } from '~features/count-button'\n\nimport '~style.css'\n\nconst PUBLISHABLE_KEY = process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\n\nif (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {\n  throw new Error('Please add the PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to the .env.development file')\n}\n\nfunction IndexPopup() {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>\n      <div className=\"plasmo-flex plasmo-items-center plasmo-justify-center plasmo-h-[600px] plasmo-w-[800px] plasmo-flex-col\">\n        <header className=\"plasmo-w-full\">\n          {/* Show the sign-in and sign-up buttons when the user is signed out */}\n          <SignedOut>\n            <SignInButton mode=\"modal\" />\n            <SignUpButton mode=\"modal\" />\n          </SignedOut>\n          {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}\n          <SignedIn>\n            <UserButton />\n          </SignedIn>\n        </header>\n        <main className=\"plasmo-grow\">\n          <CountButton />\n        </main>\n      </div>\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default IndexPopup\nUpdate <ClerkProvider> props for Chrome Extension navigation\n\nTo avoid navigation errors, set the afterSignOutUrl, signInFallbackRedirectUrl and signUpFallbackRedirectUrl props for <ClerkProvider>. Chrome Extensions don't use an http URL, such as http://localhost:3000. Instead, they use a chrome-extension:// URL appended with an unique extension ID called a CRX ID. This URL is what you will pass to these props.\n\nsrc/popup.tsx\nimport {\n  ClerkProvider,\n  SignInButton,\n  SignUpButton,\n  SignedIn,\n  SignedOut,\n  UserButton,\n} from '@clerk/chrome-extension'\n\nimport { CountButton } from '~features/count-button'\n\nimport '~style.css'\n\nconst PUBLISHABLE_KEY = process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\nconst EXTENSION_URL = chrome.runtime.getURL('.')\n\nif (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {\n  throw new Error('Please add the PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to the .env.development file')\n}\n\nfunction IndexPopup() {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}\n      afterSignOutUrl={`${EXTENSION_URL}/popup.html`}\n      signInFallbackRedirectUrl={`${EXTENSION_URL}/popup.html`}\n      signUpFallbackRedirectUrl={`${EXTENSION_URL}/popup.html`}\n    >\n      <div className=\"plasmo-flex plasmo-items-center plasmo-justify-center plasmo-h-[600px] plasmo-w-[800px] plasmo-flex-col\">\n        <header className=\"plasmo-w-full\">\n          <SignedOut>\n            <SignInButton mode=\"modal\" />\n            <SignUpButton mode=\"modal\" />\n          </SignedOut>\n          <SignedIn>\n            <UserButton />\n          </SignedIn>\n        </header>\n        <main className=\"plasmo-grow\">\n          <CountButton />\n        </main>\n      </div>\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default IndexPopup\nCreate a consistent CRX ID for your extension\n\nChrome Extensions have a unique CRX ID that rotates by default, which can cause errors with the Clerk integration. To avoid these problems, ensure that you have a consistent CRX ID in both development and production for your extension by following these steps:\n\nVisit Plasmo Itero's Generate Keypairs⁠ tool.\nSelect Generate KeyPairs.\nSave the Private Key somewhere secure in case you need it in the future. Save the Public Key and the CRX ID for the next steps.\nCreate an .env.chrome file to store your public key\n\nCreate an .env.chrome file and add your public key to it, as shown in the following example:\n\n.env.chrome\nCRX_PUBLIC_KEY=<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>\nEdit your package.json to use the new public key\n\nPlasmo uses the package.json to generate a manifest.json on build⁠, and allows for the use of environment variables in package.json.\n\nIn your package.json, in the manifest object:\n\nSet the key value to \"$CRX_PUBLIC_KEY\". This helps configure the consistent CRX ID for your extension.\nSet the permissions array to include \"cookies\" and \"storage\". permissions specifies which permissions your extension requires.\nSet or update the host_permissions array to include \"http://localhost/*\" and \"$CLERK_FRONTEND_API/*\". host_permissions specifies which hosts, or websites, have permission to sync auth state with your app.\npackage.json\n{\n  // The rest of your package.json file\n  \"manifest\": {\n    \"key\": \"$CRX_PUBLIC_KEY\",\n    \"permissions\": [\"cookies\", \"storage\"],\n    \"host_permissions\": [\"http://localhost/*\", \"$CLERK_FRONTEND_API/*\"]\n  }\n}\nUse pnpm dev to start your development server and create a build\n\nPlasmo facilitates Chrome Extension development by automatically \"hot loading\" the app whenever you save a changed file in the project. This ensures the build/chrome-mv3-dev folder remains up to date. Without the plugin, you would need to manually execute the build command and reload your Chrome Extension after each change. Plasmo automates this process, streamlining development.\n\nRun the following command to start your development environment. This also creates the build in build/chrome-mv3-dev, and rebuilds when you make changes to the extension.\n\nterminal\npnpm dev\nLoad your Chrome Extension into your Chromium-based browser\n\nTo load your Chrome Extension, follow these steps:\n\nOpen Chrome or a Chromium-based browser and navigate to chrome://extensions.\nIn the top-right, enable Developer mode.\nIn the top-left, select Load unpacked.\nNavigate to where your project is located and select the build/chrome-mv3-dev folder. Then select Select. Your extension will now be loaded and shown in the list of extensions.\nConfirm that the ID shown in your extension matches the CRX ID you saved \nearlier\n.\nTest your Chrome Extension\n\nIn your Chrome browser, open the extension popup. Ensure that the <SignInButton> appears, and that selecting it opens the <SignIn /> modal. Sign in and ensure that the <UserButton /> appears in the header.\n\nWarning\n\nAfter signing up or signing in, your popup may appear to crash. Closing and reopening the popup should restart the extension and you should be signed in.\n\nYour extension does not yet have anything to handle routing, and by default, the Clerk components attempt to redirect the user. See the guide on adding React Router to your Chrome Extension to add routing to your extension.\n\nNext steps\n\nLearn how to add routing to your Chrome Extension, keep user sessions in sync, and how to use Clerk's client-side helpers using the following guides.\n\nAdd React Router\n\nLearn how to add React Router to your Chrome Extension.\n\nSync your Chrome Extension with your web app\n\nLearn how to configure your Chrome Extension to sync user authentication with your web app.\n\ncreateClerkClient()\n\nLearn how to use Clerk's createClerkClient() function in a background service worker to ensure that the user's session is always fresh.\n\nDeploy a Chrome Extension to production\n\nLearn how to deploy your Clerk Chrome Extension to production.\n\nConfigure a consistent CRX ID\n\nLearn how to configure a consistent CRX ID to ensure your extension has a stable, unchanging key.\n\nClerk Chrome Extension SDK Reference\n\nLearn about the Clerk Chrome Extension SDK and how to integrate it into your app.\n\nFeedback\nWhat did you think of this content?\nIt was helpful\nIt was not helpful\nI have feedback\n\nLast updated on Feb 16, 2026\n\nView raw file\nEdit on GitHub\nProduct\nAuthentication\nB2B Authentication\nBilling\nSDKs\nReact\nNext.js\nExpo\nView all\nResources\nDocumentation\nChangelog\nGlossary\nFeature requests\nStartups\nLLM Leaderboard\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nContact\nBrand assets\nLegal\nTerms and conditions\nTerms of engagement\nPrivacy policy\nData processing agreement\nDo not sell/share my info\nCookie manager\n\n© 2026 Clerk, Inc.\n\nSupport",
